    "body": "I could not reproduce the second race. I believe 74f4b8d solved it. (It would have been kill() getting interrupted between checking if blocked (kill_lock held) and calling wakeup (which uses state_lock). Unifying the locks made that atomic.)\n\nThe first one still races around `detach_cond` in rust_port.cpp, specifically when a kill happens between these two lines:\n\n```\n 29         if (task->blocked_on(&detach_cond)) {\n 30             // XXX race here\n 31             task->wakeup(&detach_cond);\n 32         }\n```\n\nThis is the sort of thing #2787 is warning about.\n",
