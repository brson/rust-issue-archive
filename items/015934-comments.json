    "body": "Like @alexcrichton, I'm not thrilled about the `foo_ms` functions, I'd rather see them go away (since the names are being reused they can't merely be deprecated).\n\nI'd also like to see a mechanism to convert a `Duration` back into a numeric value with a given period. I see three general approaches that could work here:\n1. A bunch of methods, `to_ms()`, `to_ns()`, etc (which would all return signed values).\n2. Phantom types for each period (that all implement a trait that provides the conversion between the period and nanoseconds, which would incidentally allow users to define custom periods if that's helpful). This is nice because it could get rid of the plethora of existing constructor methods too, leaving just\n   \n   ``` rust\n   pub fn new<T: Period>(period: T, value: i64) -> Duration;\n   pub fn from_parts(days: i32, seconds: u32, nanoseconds: u32) -> Duration;\n   ```\n   \n   Extracting the value would then look like:\n   \n   ``` rust\n   pub fn ticks<T: Period>(&self, period: T) -> i64;\n   ```\n3. Phantom types for each period again, but make `Duration` be specialized on it instead. This one would be similar to C++'s `std::chrono::duration`. Not sure if there's a compelling reason to do this over approach 2.\n\nI think approach 2 might be the best.\n",

This addresses _most_ of the feedback.\n\nSome notes:\n- I changed `MAX` and `MIN` to `MAX_DURATION` and `MIN_DURATION` since they are in the `time` module, not the `duration` module here.\n- Timers need to do something when they see a negative duration. Currently they fail.\n- I removed the `zero` constructor since it duplicates `Zero::zero`. This pattern will be fixed at the language level eventually by allowing `Duration::zero` as syntax to call `Zero::zero`.\n- The various convenience constructors don't follow conventions (should be `new_seconds` or something).\n- The convenience constructors are very verbose. Writing `Duration::milliseconds` feels like torture :)\n",

    "body": "I've made the three types of timers do something with 0 and negative durations: `sleep` returns immediately and `oneshot` fires the message immediately.\n\n`period` is specced to send a constant stream of messages, but the implementation doesn't actually support this (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/16148) so I added a hack to temporarily use a 1 ms duration in this case. (I'm not sure what this _should_ do with zero duration - sending a torrent of messages in a loop sounds useless to me).\n\nThe two `connect_timeout` methods now also take `Duration` and have a precondition that it must be positive (it's impossible to connect instantaneously so a 0 duration is senseless).\n\nFinally, I went ahead and moved `Duration` to `time::duration` so that the constants can stay named `MIN`/`MAX`, and reexported it from `time`.\n\nI have no further edits queued. Need more review.\n",

    "body": "This generally looks like a good design to me, and I'm happy with the proposed placement into `std::time::duration`. It would definitely benefit from a detailed module-level doc comment, but that can be added separately. \n\nI don't care much about the _internal_ division into `days`/`secs`/`nanos`, but the choice leaks into the public API in a few places -- the `new` and `new_opt` constructors, and the `to_tuple` function. Since the division is somewhat arbitrary (and not clearly useful to an end-user), I would consider dropping the `new`, `new_opt` and `to_tuple` functions and providing only functions that are independent from the representation here.\n\nOther than these functions, the public API is exactly what I'd expect from any duration type, and I feel comfortable committing to such an API.\n\nOtherwise I have no reservations.\n",
