  "body": "These commits enable Rust programs to actually run in parallel. Domains (which have not yet been renamed) now spin up a certain number of threads, and tasks are scheduled between these threads.\n\nThe number of threads is controlled by the RUST_THREADS environment variable. By default, only one thread is used, so this should not impact anyone unless they intentionally enable multithreading.\n\nThe simplest way to get this working was to serialize all upcalls. This clearly won't give us optimal performance, but I imagine we can relax this some after more design and testing.\n",
