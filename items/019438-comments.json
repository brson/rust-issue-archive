    "body": "Hmm, running this test to completion I see that it breaks some tests. (I think that those tests should not have been working in the first place, but what they are doing is fundamentally useful.) The tests are all cases where `Clone` must be implemented for `fn(&int)`; the existing impl works only for types not containing bound regions. I think the only real fix to this is to have some kind of blanket impl that applies to all fn types, perhaps a meta-trait identifying fn pointers.\n",
