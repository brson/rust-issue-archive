    "body": "@pnkfelix That sounds good to me.\n\n@alexcrichton has a pull request open for this but I think we should do a little more. In Alex's formulation all the `#[deny(*)]`  attributes are passed as `-D` flags on the command line in stage1+. Passing flags on the command line though isn't very rusty - I would rather see these as attributes at the top of the crate.\n\nTwo ways we could achieve this would be to: a) add command line flags for converting warnings to errors and ignoring warnings, so each stage just has one extra command line flag instead of all the lint flags, or b) making attributes themselves conditional. I prefer the former.\n",

    "body": "@brson, what do you think about `-D warnings` along with a `#[deny(warnings)]` attribute?\n\nThat role of it would be to deny all warnings, turning them into errors by default. There could then be some validation as well to say `-A warnings` allows all warnings to go unnoticed, and `-W warnings` itself does nothing (treats warnings as warnings, non fatal)\n\nThat way stage0 would have `-A warnings` and stage1+ would have `-D warnings` and that's it. That way we could still control the lint levels manually inside the crates without having to specify them all on the command line. Additionally whenever a crate were ready to deny common lints by default, they just need to add `#[deny(warnings)]`\n",
