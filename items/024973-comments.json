[CSS can\u2019t change the `title` attribute of an element](http://stackoverflow.com/q/6136855), so the button will keep saying \u201ccollapse all docs\u201d even when it is in the \u2018[+]\u2019 state.\n\nBut I agree that it would be nice to consolidate rendering as much as possible. It would also be nice to look at the element\u2019s `class` to determine its current state, instead of examining its content with `toggle.html() == \"[\\u2212]\"`.\n",

Now that the proper symbols are used, `inner` can be removed completely, for simplicity. That would make the button-label-setting code the same for both types of buttons.\n\nBut perhaps all this refactoring should be delayed to another issue. The collapse button is broken right now, and this fix works, and at least doesn\u2019t make the code quality any _worse_.\n",

    "body": "I have implemented and tested the requested refactoring. Details are in the commit message:\n\n> To separate concerns, instead of checking the state of `#toggle-all-docs` by looking at its label text, I add or remove a class `will-expand` depending on whether the button\u2019s next click will expand everything. (The `if` statement\u2019s two branches were swapped as part of this change.)\n> \n> I moved the desired text values to a function `labelForToggleButton`, so changing the values will be easier. I also note in a comment the other file where the text is duplicated.\n> \n> To allow the labels of both types of toggle buttons to be uniformly set, I added a `span.inner` to the global button too.\n> \n> I split the template in `render.rs` into multiple lines to make room for the `span`, and that adds whitespace around the `[` and `]` text elements. That seems to be okay, though \u2013 the page still looks the same.\n> \n> I updated the CSS styling for `.collapse-toggle > .inner` to add a little extra space around the symbol, to make minus signs easier to identify. (`#toggle-all-docs > .inner` does not need the same style, since its text size is bigger, so it naturally puts more space around the symbol.)\n",
