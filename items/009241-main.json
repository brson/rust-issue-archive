  "body": "Now rustdoc_ng will be built as both a binary and a library (using the same\nrules as all the other binaries that rust has). Furthermore, this will also\nstart building rustdoc_ng unit tests (and running them).\n\nNote that some `rustdoc_ng` tests were removed, but @cmr says they weren't supposed to be there in the first place. The rustdoc_ng code should also be included in `make install` and `make dist` now.\n",
