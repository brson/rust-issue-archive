    "body": "Felix -- this looks like a good patch. My one concern is that it means that the dtor rule is enforced in two distinct places (one in moves.rs -- which is not otherwise tasked with reporting errors -- and also in gather_moves `check_is_legal_to_move_from()`). This concerns me lest new rules related to moves should arise. The fix I had in mind (having FSU's generate moves in gather_moves for all fields that are consumed) would seem to address that, at the cost of duplicating the logic for computing which fields are consumed. What do you think?\n",
