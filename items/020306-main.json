  "body": "This commit performs a second pass over the `std::string` module, performing the\nfollowing actions:\n- The name `std::string` is now stable.\n- The `String::from_utf8` function is now stable after having been altered to\n  return a new `FromUtf8Error` structure. The `FromUtf8Error` structure is now\n  stable as well as its `into_bytes` and `utf8_error` methods.\n- The `String::from_utf8_lossy` function is now stable.\n- The `String::from_chars` method is now deprecated in favor of `.collect()`\n- The `String::from_raw_parts` method is now stable\n- The `String::from_str` function remains experimental\n- The `String::from_raw_buf` function remains experimental\n- The `String::from_raw_buf_len` function remains experimental\n- The `String::from_utf8_unchecked` function is now stable\n- The `String::from_char` function is now deprecated in favor of\n  `repeat(c).take(n).collect()`\n- The `String::grow` function is now deprecated in favor of\n  `.extend(repeat(c).take(n)`\n- The `String::capacity` method is now stable\n- The `String::reserve` method is now stable\n- The `String::reserve_exact` method is now stable\n- The `String::shrink_to_fit` method is now stable\n- The `String::pop` method is now stable\n- The `String::as_mut_vec` method is now stable\n- The `String::is_empty` method is now stable\n- The `IntoString` trait is now deprecated (there are no implementors)\n- The `String::truncate` method is now stable\n- The `String::insert` method is now stable\n- The `String::remove` method is now stable\n- The `String::push` method is now stable\n- The `String::push_str` method is now stable\n- The `String::from_utf16` function is now stable after its error type has now\n  become an opaque structure to carry more semantic information in the future.\n\nA number of these changes are breaking changes, but the migrations should be\nfairly straightforward on a case-by-case basis (outlined above where possible).\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
