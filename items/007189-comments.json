    "body": "Floating point numbers have no obvious semantics with regards to shifting, compared to integers. \n\nExample, `45i << 2 == 180`, is fairly well understood. What does this expression produce: `65.494 << 2`? To match the mathmatical result for ints, it would need to be `261.976`, but if it's a bit shift, then it's (according to a quick program I wrote) `0.000000` for a f32 and `-369098.750000` for f64.\n\nMore importantly, there is no basic operation for floating point shifts so it would have to be implemented in software. Rust is a systems language, so hidden costs are considered bad and shifting is generally considered to be a speedy operation. having `1f << 5` take a hundred more cycles than `1 << 5` is pretty hidden to me.\n\nLastly, what use would it be? Bit shifting is normally done for the encoding of data at a bit level, but floating point numbers are bit-level encoding. You are essentially asking if we are planning to implement a way to corrupt floating point numbers at a language level.\n\n---\n\nNot a bug. Closing.\n",

    "body": "@Aatch , that's not quite true; for example, LLVM has a floating-point shift instruction: http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/namespacellvm_1_1X86ISD.html \n\nMy understanding is that typically, low-level compiler optimizations would turn other floating-point operations onto shifts (operating on the bit-level representation of floats so as to preserve semantics; floats aren't magic, you can manipulate their representations just as with ints), but this isn't an area I'm particularly familiar with. On the other hand, I don't imagine rustc would ever do these optimizations, since LLVM can do them perfectly well. @graydon , can you confirm/deny that this bug should stay closed?\n",
