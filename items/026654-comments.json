    "body": "Updated WIP at MrAlert/rust@08413003f32f2cc554215ff942e43ca47aa2362d. Added fallback groups, and removed branches on calls to compatibility functions by initializing the function pointers to point to loader stubs instead of NULL. Should perform roughly as well as regular DLL calls now (if it didn't already.)\n\nI also tested the fallbacks under Windows 7, and for whatever reason `sync::condvar::tests::wait_timeout_with` still fails, even after I fixed the return values on `SleepConditionVariableSRW`. Everything else passes, however.\n\nWhen using the executable from `make check-stage1-std`, `thread::local::tests::dtors_in_dtors_in_dtors` hangs under Windows XP, but using the stage2 test executable, it runs fine. Probably has to do with TLS callback stuff failing to work on a dynamically-linked libstd on XP for some reason.\n\nlibstd tests that currently fail in XP include: `env::tests::test_env_set_var`, `fs::tests::truncate_works`, all tests in `net::tcp` and `net::udp`, and `sync::condvar::tests::wait_timeout_with`.\n",
