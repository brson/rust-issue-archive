  "body": "This commit is an implementation of [RFC 823](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0823-hash-simplification.md) which is another pass over\nthe `std::hash` module for stabilization. The contents of the module were not\nentirely marked stable, but some portions which remained quite similar to the\nprevious incarnation are now marked `#[stable]`. Specifically:\n- `std::hash` is now stable (the name)\n- `Hash` is now stable\n- `Hash::hash` is now stable\n- `Hasher` is now stable\n- `SipHasher` is now stable\n- `SipHasher::new` and `new_with_keys` are now stable\n- `Hasher for SipHasher` is now stable\n- Many `Hash` implementations are now stable\n\nAll other portions of the `hash` module remain `#[unstable]` as they are less\ncommonly used and were recently redesigned.\n\nThis commit is a breaking change due to the modifications to the `std::hash` API\nand more details can be found on the [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0823-hash-simplification.md).\n\nCloses #22467\n[breaking-change]\n",
