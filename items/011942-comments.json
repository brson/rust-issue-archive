    "body": "@alexcrichton Failure on `.len()` is the other possible course of action, but it just didn't seem particularly useful. The other methods fail because they don't have a sensible alternative behavior (well, `with_ref()` could yield the null pointer, but that's not very useful).\n\n`.as_str()` has an optional return value because not all valid CStrings can be valid Rust strings (notably, CStrings don't require utf-8). I suppose it could return None on a non-utf8 string and fail on a null buffer, but as long as it has an optional return type already, why fail?\n\nIncidentally, I think `.iter()` might also crash on null. The question is, make it fail or make it be an empty iterator? I'm tempted to make it fail. Although if I do that, that lends more credence to the suggestion to make `.len()` fail on null as well.\n\nHmm.\n",
