The more we work with iterators, the more natural things like \"iterator transformers\" such as this are. It's a fine ball to get rolling in my opinion.\n\n> The error type of the iterator may be a little unidiomatic, we probably want to wrap it up in something to provide extra contextual information in the future.\n\nAgreed.\n\n> Having only one char constant in the module seems kinda odd, surely there are more constant-like things (like newline?) which we may wish to have?\n\nPerhaps so -- but IMO this should influence organization more than anything. That is, we might want to think about a submodule for constants, if we do anticipate adding more over time.\n\n# \n\nMost of the other points have the flavor of: why stabilize just this one piece? I agree that I'd really like to have an overall vision here; I feel like every cycle we stabilize a couple of related methods. That said, your matrix is pretty useful, and does indeed suggest we should land both this and an analogous utf8 decoder.\n",

    "body": "> - Do we want to support `decode_utfXX_lossy`? Are they easy enough to do with a `.map(|e| e.unwrap_or(REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER))`?\n\nSince `decode_utf16()` has a dedicated return type this could also be `decode_utf16().lossy()`. IMO this is nicer than a function that would need to be imported separately. FWIW I had this in the PR originally and removed it at your suggestion :) https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27808#issuecomment-132371503\n\n> - Having only one char constant in the module seems kinda odd, surely there are more constant-like things (like newline?) which we may wish to have?\n\nWe can remove the constant if lossy decoding is built-in.\n\n> I guess in that sense we'd be \"complete\" with `decode_utf8`? Is that all we need to put this issue to rest?\n\nYes, I do think we\u2019re missing something lower-level than we currently have in `std`\u00a0for decoding UTF-8. Something that does not allocate (could potentially be in libcore) and is more flexible than `str::from_utf8` (which is strict (not lossy) and requires the entire input to be in a single slice).\n\nBut since `&str`\u00a0and `String` use UTF-8 internally I don\u2019t think decoding to `Iterator<char>` is ideal. We\u2019d like to use slices of the input when possible.\n\nI have some experiments at https://github.com/SimonSapin/rust-utf8. (In you\u2019re interested, the commit history shows a number of different APIs I tried.) It supports \"incremental\" lossy decoding: input is a number of `&[u8]` chunks and a single code point may span multiple chunks. Output borrows input when possible and never allocates.\n\nBut this is significantly more API surface than, say, an iterator adaptor. And there\u2019s probably a wide variety of use cases with slightly different constraints (@BurntSushi mentioned decoding in reverse), so I don\u2019t know if it makes sense to try and support all of them in `std`.\n\nStill, it\u2019d be nice to have a single UTF-8 decoding primitive `std` that everything else could be based on. That way future performance improvements like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30740 (more may be possible with SIMD) would apply automatically, ideally. Though I don\u2019t know yet what that primitive should be exactly, or if it\u2019s even possible.\n",

    "body": "@BurntSushi Building something that yields `&str` slices borrowing the input on top of this API is a fair amount of extra logic, even more so to support code points spanning chunks. And it would do more work than necessary (compute actual 32-bit values rather than just figure out which byte sequences are well-formed), I don\u2019t know if the compile could optimize that away. And this API does not enable optimizations like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30740 that decode more than one code point at once.\n",
