The reason that they're different is that i originally was going to make them both `trpl`, but we decided to switch to `book` at the last minute, and I only renamed the output, not the input.\n\nThat being said, I don't feel strongly enough about it to write said patch myself, so I'm going to close this. I'd accept a PR from someone else though.\n",
