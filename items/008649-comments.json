    "body": "@thestinger Here are my thoughts:\n1. I think that expanding `for` into equivalent code is actually the _correct_ way to implement it. Writing custom code in trans, borrow checker, etc is a waste of time and just going to lead to more bugs and a more confusing compiler.\n2. However, we ought to give better error messages, such that the expansion of `for` into equivalent code is not user visible.\n3. I have no idea how much impact it would have on compile time to add an extra function call, or use a `next()` helper instead of calling `iter.next()` directly, but I suspect it is minimal. Measurements might be helpful.\n\nIn my ideal world, we would build up some infrastructure for doing this sort of rewriting. I know that some (e.g. @pcwalton) have their doubts about the utility of this. However, if we were careful we could reduce the Rust language to a truly small set of operations. This would have the further benefit that this would be quite close to a language that we can formalize and prove sound etc etc.\n",

This is particularly true as we push towards 1.0. That said, I do think we should avoid having a \"duck typing\" scenario for 1.0, since that is not what we intend to support in the future.\n",
