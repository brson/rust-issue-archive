    "body": "@huonw Huh, that actually make me rethink about the entire strategy currently used with `||` and `>>`. Technically we can replace `Parser::bump` with `Parser::expect` plus a partial token handling, but we already have a heap of `match`es that cannot be easily refactored without replacing them with multiple conditionals which prevents the refactoring. Well, I'd leave this commit as is for now.\n",
