    "body": "> What the function should be called (wcwidth is pretty C-ish and maybe not so Rustic).\n\nIt can be a function/method on `char` like `'a'.width()` or something.\n\n> Where the autogen stuff should live (maybe in src/etc/unicode_width?)\n\nThere's a `unicode.py` script already.\n\n> Whether you'd like me to add a wcwidth_cjk-equivalent function, whose behavior is slightly different on certain spacing characters, as described in http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c (see comment above the mk_wcwidth_cjk function).\n\nThe comment suggests that this is mainly a legacy thing, and so (in my mind) isn't a high priority.\n",
