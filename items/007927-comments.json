It only so happens that the supplement of `libstd` is `libextra`. Sadly you can't quite accomplish what you wanted to do because you'd get conflicting messages about duplicate `libextra` files.\n\nOn the other hand, you could always modify `extra.rs` to have the name be something like `extra2` and then have `extern mod extra2` in your source file.\n",

Use `extern mod extra2` or whatever name you used to link to it\n4. Compile code with `-L .`\n\nNow those steps may be a bit complicated, so in my opinion the issue should be more about simplifying them possibly?\n",

    "body": "Yes, the problem is the existing workaround is too complex. My idea about the flags is just one specific suggestion.\n\nI think I should clarify the issue. The main problem is that the process of developing, and managing alternate versions of existing libraries is too complicated. I know the Haskell cabal package manager has a similar problem, and that people have various hacks so that they can switch between, and use separate Haskell build environments. Perhaps we can steal a good solution from there?\n\nAlso, this might be more a rustpkg problem than a rustc problem. Perhaps when rustpkg is more mature the process of automatically pulling in the extra directory could be pulled up a level of abstraction to rustpkg instead of rustc? \n",
