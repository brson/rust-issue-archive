    "body": "By introducing a small pause between reaching for the forks I was able to introduce a deadlock. \n\n``` rust\nfn eat(&self, table: &Table){\n    println!(\"{} is reaching for the {} fork\",self.name,self.left);\n    let _left = table.forks[self.left].lock().unwrap();\n    println!(\"{} got the {} fork!\",self.name, self.left);\n\n    println!(\"{} pauses to compose themselves.\", self.name);\n    thread::sleep_ms(100);\n\n    println!(\"{} is reaching for the {} fork\",self.name,self.right);\n    let _right = table.forks[self.right].lock().unwrap();\n    println!(\"{} got the {} fork!\", self.name,self.right);\n\n    println!(\"{} got the forks! Time to eat.\", self.name);\n    thread::sleep_ms(1000);\n    println!(\"{} is done eating.\", self.name);\n}\n```\n\nKnowing that I can write Rust deadlocks and then see how reversing the arguments fixes the deadlock helps me understand what Rust can and cannot do. Would folks be interested in a pull request expanding the Dining Philosophers page to include example that actually deadlocks? \n",

    "body": "So, it introduces the _possibility_ of deadlock, it doesn't guarantee that it will. As you've noticed. :)\n\nWe already have https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27932 open, and it hasn't been dealt with, so I'm going to give this ticket a close, as it's effectively a dup. I would take a PR with your explanation, as it would fix that issue too :)\n",
