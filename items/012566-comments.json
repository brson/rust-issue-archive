    "body": "The PR looks fine to me. However, I think its test coverage is a bit lacking. In particular, patterns in trait declarations are not covered. For example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn get_val(&self) -> int;\n    fn do_stuff(&self @ SomeGarbage(a, b)) -> int { self.get_val() + 2 }\n}\n```\n\nshould not be allowed (the trait doesn't know what type Self is to destructure it).\n\nIf at all possible, I think the ideal syntax, to be in line with other arguments, would be `pattern: &self`. Then you could write `fn cross(&Vector(a, b, c): &self, &Vector(d, e, f): &Vector) -> Vector`, which I think is much more appealing.\n",

With universal function-call syntax (UFCS #11938) there will not be any distinction between static methods and instance methods - they will both be 'associated functions'. At that point any function who's first argument is the self type will be callable with method syntax, and `self`, `&self`, and `&mut self` are just sugar for i.e. `self: &Self`, and destructuring on the self argument can be done as normal by not using the self-sugar.\n\nClosing.\n",
