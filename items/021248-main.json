  "body": "This implements the remaining bits of 'feature staging', as described in [RFC 507](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0507-release-channels.md).\n\nThis is not quite done, but the substance of the work is complete so submitting for early review.\n\nKey changes:\n- `unstable`, `stable` and `deprecated` attributes all require 'feature' and 'since', and support an optional 'reason'.\n- The `unstable` lint is removed.\n- A new 'stability checking' pass warns when a used unstable library feature has not been activated with the `feature` attribute. At 1.0 beta this will become an error.\n- A new 'unused feature checking' pass emits a lint ('unused_feature', renamed from 'unknown_feature') for any features that were activated but not used.\n- A new tidy script `featureck.py` performs some global sanity checking, particularly that 'since' numbers agree, and also prints out a summary of features.\n\nDifferences from RFC:\n- As implemented `unstable` requires a `since` attribute. I do not know if this is useful. I included it in the original sed script and just left it.\n- RFC didn't specify the name of the optional 'reason' attribute.\n- This continues to use 'unstable', 'stable' and 'deprecated' names (the 'nice' names) instead of 'staged_unstable', but only activates them with the crate-level 'staged_api' attribute.\n\nI intend to update the RFC based on the outcome of this PR.\n\nIssues:\n- The unused feature check doesn't account for language features - i.e. you can activate a language feature, not use it, and not get the error.\n\nOpen questions:\n- All unstable and deprecated features are named 'unnamed_feature', which i picked just because it is uniquely greppable. This is the 'catch-all' feature. What should it be?\n- All stable features are named 'grandfathered'. What should this be?\n\nTODO:\n- Add check that all `deprecated` attributes are paired with a `stable` attribute in order to preserve the knowledge about when a feature became stable.\n- Update rustdoc in various ways.\n- Remove obsolete stability discussion from reference.\n- Add features for 'path', 'io', 'os', 'hash' and 'rand'.\n\ncc #20445 @alexcrichton @aturon \n",
