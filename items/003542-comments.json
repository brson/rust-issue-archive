    "body": "I strongly agree with not having const have so many overloaded meanings.  To be honest, I think const-the-mutability-qualifier is the odd man out here, and I would like to change it to something else, but I don't know what (`read`? too valuable to use as a keyword. `mut?`? looks funny, can't pronounce it.  `rd` or `ro`? Eh.).  I think there is another issue to this effect.  I know @jruderman has raised the issue before (and rightly so).\n\nThat said, I think Freeze may not be the right name for the trait we currently call Const.  Here is my reasoning: a freezable data structure is one which is based purely on owned data and with no explicit mutable qualifiers.  This is currently described by `Send Const`---the `Const` captures the lack of mutability qualifiers and the `Send` captures the \"relies purely on owned data\".  So it seems to me that Freeze, if it exists, should be a \"subtrait\" of Send and Const.\n\nNow, it is not clear to me whether a trait that means \"immutable\" is necessary on its own.  @pcwalton and I have talked about some ideas for removing pure functions and replacing them with closures with a \"Const\" bound, so it'd be important then.  The best name I can come up for to replace Const is Imm (for Immutable, which seems a touch long), even though it is true that an instance of an Imm type, when placed in a mutable local variable (or other mutable context), is in fact mutable.  But somehow `NoMut` doesn't seem to have the same ring!\n",

I'm alluding to the way that `Send` (no @-pointers) already implies `Owned` (no &-pointers).\n\nIt seems to me we should either (a) make const/send/owned such that each one implies the next (which means `Freeze` would indeed mean `Const Send Owned`), or (b) change `Send` to not imply no &-pointers (whether or not there would ever be a use case for it?) (such that ARCs would require `Const Send Owned`, not just `Const Send`).\n\nIf there is a use case for `Const`-without-`Send`, I favour (b); otherwise, I'm not sure which one I favour.\n",
