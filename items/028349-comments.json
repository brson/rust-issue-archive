    "body": "I'd personally prefer if there were different kinds of lints entirely (not one kind of lint with different available contexts -- this means the lint will be run multiple times). So, basically, the LintStore would contain both EarlyLintPasses and LateLintPasses. It also keeps the lint traits easier to understand. If we want to have \"MIR lints\" in the future, the design is easily extended.\n\nBut I'm not insistent on this, the current model is fine too.\n\nAside from that and the check_mac thing, LGTM\n",

    "body": "My first idea for this was having two kinds of lints (early and late), but I decided against basically for backwards compatibility and simplicity. With the changes as they stand, lint authors only need to import a trait. I thought having to use different pass names, etc. would be too much of a breaking change. However, I guess if we are going to break lints even a little, then breaking them a lot is not much worse. I also thought it was easier having one big lint, rather than lots of little ones, but I'm not really sure about that.\n\nIf the backcompat issue is not too big a deal, then I can redo this with different lint passes pretty easily.\n",
