    "body": "This looks fantastic, nice job!\n\nCould you add some examples in the module documentation about how to use it. Just something which has the necessary imports and goes through the process of creating an Rng, reseeding it, and things like that. I don't think it really needs to demonstrate how to use `Rng`, but rather just how to get access to the mersenne things.\n\nThe name of the module is pretty long: `std::rand::mersenne_twister::MT19937Rng`, so I'd also be ok shortening it, but not really that necessary. I suppose you're not supposed to be using this that much anyway.\n\nRegardless, with a doc-block expansion, r=me\n",

    "body": "> ISAAC has significant known weaknesses\n\nCitation? The only ones I know of is are [Pudovkina](http://eprint.iacr.org/2001/049) and [Aumasson](http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/438) ([wikipedia agrees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAAC_%28cipher%29#Cryptanalysis)), and I don't think that either are considered significant. In any case, I was/am considering \"upgrading\" us to the ISAAC+ Aumasson proposes, but I believe that it has had even less cryptanalysis.\n\n> It would also be a good idea to look into replacing ISAAC with one of the eSTREAM ciphers\n\nFiled https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10047.\n\n> if it's actually significantly faster than ISAAC\n\nHm, I don't remember it being _slower_.\n\n```\ntest rand::bench::rand_isaac                         ... bench:       973 ns/iter (+/- 78) = 822 MB/s\ntest rand::bench::rand_isaac64                       ... bench:       481 ns/iter (+/- 38) = 1663 MB/s\ntest rand::bench::rand_mt19937                       ... bench:      1049 ns/iter (+/- 39) = 762 MB/s\ntest rand::bench::rand_mt19937_64                    ... bench:       715 ns/iter (+/- 72) = 1118 MB/s\ntest rand::bench::rand_shuffle_100                   ... bench:      2326 ns/iter (+/- 99)\ntest rand::bench::rand_std                           ... bench:       480 ns/iter (+/- 31) = 1666 MB/s\ntest rand::bench::rand_xorshift                      ... bench:       287 ns/iter (+/- 19) = 2787 MB/s\n```\n\nI'll close this unless someone _really_ thinks that mirroring C++11 is important. (I imagine that [SFMT and/or dSFMT](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/) will be much faster, but they are more complicated to implement, so not today.)\n",
