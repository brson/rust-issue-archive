This has a couple of advantages \n- loading the latest version from the CDN\n- parallel http request and thus faster load times\n- if the font from the CDN has been loaded on another page, it will be cached and thus speed up the page load too.\n\nIt might be interesting to do that for jQuery too since it is the most downloaded js library there is a very high probability that it will already be in the browser cache.\n",

After some time you can get used to it, but at first this not just sucks, it tells me to leave the page and never come back.\n\nThe solution to update the font on all of my computers is not acceptable for me. I have 2 win10 and 2 win7 machines having the same problem, all in chrome browser, and to be honest: I don't want to update my computers by hand, just for one website. Even if it's a chrome problem, there is a way to work around that problem.\n\nWhy not just remove the font, and use the other ones? _DejaVu Sans Mono_ looks very clean and good, and it's been around for quite some time, so I guess it's glitch free?\n",
