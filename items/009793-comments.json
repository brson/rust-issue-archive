    "body": "Specifically here, these references are denied because `submod` is not public. It'd be nice to have a NOTE saying what needs to be flagged as public. There could possibly be a large chain of things which need to be public, but we can only point to the closest-to-the-definition one, which I think is OK anyway.\n\nAlso note that this will only work for local crate references, all external crate references don't have information about what the \"closest private thing\" was, or at least I don't think that they do...\n",
