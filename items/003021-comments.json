Fixing that fixed the test case, but then I realized the behavior should be the same for classes and traits (which is currently isn't). That's a problem because the obvious fix stops class methods from being able to refer to their class-bound ty params.\n\nResolve is doing something weird with def_ids for `def_ty_param`s... so I'm still working on this.\n",
