    "body": "Marijn, I am somewhat concerned about your fix (which introduces the `ty_named()` variant into sty; basically a layer of indirection into `ty::t` that preserves the user type).  It bothers me that the intended type system is structural but our representation is nominal, seems like it's asking for subtle bugs (basically, the interning is no longer computing type equality).  \n\nTo demonstrate my point, I did a quick search through typeck for cases where we compared types using `==` or `!=`.  I found one (checking for method override equality).  Thus the following program no longer type checks:\n\n```\ntype S = uint;\ntype T = uint;\n\nfn main() {\n    obj a() {\n        fn foo() -> S { ret 2u; }\n    }\n    let my_a = a();\n\n    let my_b = obj() {\n        fn foo() -> T { ret 3u; } // Type checker reports an error\n        with my_a\n    };\n\n    assert my_b.foo() == 3u;\n}\n```\n\nWe can fix this case (use unification) and we can convert any other places where `==` or `!=` is used, but the problem is that it's hard to find all those places or guarantee that no new ones crop up.  (As an aside, it would be nice if users could declare types non-comparable, though it complicates generics).  \n\n(On the other hand, the existence of ty_var in the type hierarchy already means that comparing with `==` was a bit dubious, but it used to be safe after all variables had been substituted away)\n\nI would rather see the names kept alongside the true, interned type as side information.  This either means that we have a side table tracking, for each interned type, the shortest `ast::ty` that was resolved to it (isn't this kind of what we used to do?).  Alternatively, we could pass around a `(ty::t, ast::ty)` pair outside of the `ty` module, but that's more work.  Either way we get user-defined names for print-outs while keeping our interning meaningful.\n\nAlternatively, nominal records would basically make this problem go away with no effort at all (modulo objects).\n",

    "body": "I suggest we simply fix code that uses `==` on `ty::t` (it's a trivial fix, adding an unpack step before the compare). Both of your solutions boil down to assigning a canonical name to a hashed type, which is not correct. Module A might define `type point = {x: int, y: int}`, and module B can define the same struct type to be called `vector`. You want the right name in the right context, based not on which module you are in, but on the source of the actual type. I think this means that named types do _have_ to be different `ty::t` values, and thus have to be hashed separately.\n",

    "body": "Keep in mind, the unpack must be a deep unpack, because you might types like:\n\n```\ntype S = uint;\ntype T = uint;\ntype U = { f: S };\ntype V = { f: T };\n```\n\nwhere `U` and `V` are equivalent.  Basically, if we do that, I am not sure what the value is to interning types at all.  Also, regarding == and !=, as I said it's hard to find all the possible places such a bug could occur, you have to check through all the modules.  You also have to find anywhere that types are used in hashtables to make sure it's always the unpacked version that gets hashed, and so forth.\n\nRegarding user-visible names, yes, the names will be approximate.  We could keep the mapping from canonical type to user-defined name per-module or, better yet, per-scope, but in the end we may not print the name precisely how the user wrote it.  I am not concerned about this personally, it already happens with C compilers and typedef and so forth.  Mildly annoying but best effort is probably good enough.\n",
