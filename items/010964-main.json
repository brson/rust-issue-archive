  "body": " @alexcrichton and others: heres a proof of concept patch for configure that (for now is OS X only) checks at the very end of the configure script if `cc`, `gcc`, and `g++` possibly point to the same compiler or not.\n\nThe way its currently done is i call `cc  --version`, `gcc --version` and `g++ --version` and check if theres any matchings for the word `clang`, `gcc` or `g++`.  So it doesn't rule out miss matched gcc versions or the like, but thats a bit more implausible I think.\n",
