  "body": "`Box<[T]>` is created by allocating `Box<[T, ..n]>` and coercing it so\nthis code path is never used. It's also broken because it clamps the\ncapacity of the memory allocations to 4 elements and that's incompatible\nwith sized deallocation. This dates back to when `~[T]` was a growable\nvector type implemented as:\n\n*{ { tydesc, ref_count, prev, next }, { length, capacity, data[] } }\n\nSince even empty vectors had to allocate, it started off the capacity of\nall vectors at 4 as a heuristic. It's not possible to grow `Box<[T]>`\nand there is no need for a memory allocation when it's empty, so it\nwould be a terrible heuristic today even if it worked.\n",
