  "body": "It turns out that on linux, and possibly other platforms, child processes will\ncontinue to accept signals until they have been _reaped_. This means that once\nthe child has exited, it will succeed to receive signals until waitpid() has\nbeen invoked on it.\n\nThis is unfortunate behavior, and differs from what is seen on OSX and windows.\nThis commit changes the behavior of Process::signal() to be the same across\nplatforms, and updates the documentation of Process::kill() to note that when\nsignaling a foreign process it may accept signals until reaped.\n\nImplementation-wise, this invokes waitpid() with WNOHANG before each signal to\nthe child to ensure that if the child has exited that we will reap it. Other\npossibilities include installing a SIGCHLD signal handler, but at this time I\nbelieve that that's too complicated.\n\nCloses #13124\n",
