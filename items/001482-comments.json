Well, I recall that it could fail sometimes when invoking `send()` from within the dtor, in which case leaks would occur.  Do we have a test with a class with a dtor that just fails when executed?  Something like:\n\n```\nclass Failer { let x: @int; new(x: @int) { self.x = x; } drop { fail; } }\nfn main() {\n     let f = Failer(@10);\n     fail;\n} \n```\n\nSomething like that would seem to be the test for this bug.  For me at least, this test passes right now.\n",
