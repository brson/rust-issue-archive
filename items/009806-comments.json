    "body": "I think that this is tricky to do. Right now `Default` and `ToStr` are different semantically in the sense that I don't think that they can be directly merged. What I would be ok with, however, is to do the following:\n- Remove `deriving(ToStr)`, change it to `deriving(String)` or maybe `FmtString`. This would add a deriving implementation of the `String` formatting trait (the `:s` qualifier\n- Migrate all types using `ToStr` to `FmtString`\n- `impl<T: fmt::String> ToStr for T`\n\nThat way nothing else really needs to implement `ToStr`, the `to_str` method is just a convenient way of saying `format!(\"{:s}\", t)`.\n\nOne of the main things which I would like to avoid is a deriving-like format of the `Default` trait because I don't think that there's fantastic way to do that. What do you think about these steps?\n",

    "body": "You are right, I was actually mixing issue #9807 into the proposal, and I shouldn't have - they are logically separate. Yes, indeed, if we ignore issue #9807, it makes more sense to merge `String` or `FmtString` or whatever it is called with `ToStr` instead of merging `Default`, and making `to_str()` invoke `format!` using `{:s}` instead of `{}`. Thanks for catching this.\n",
