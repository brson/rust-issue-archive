The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pcwalton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "I agree that fixing the ICE is ultimately the best course of action. and I agree that field rearrangement could cause issues. But, even if the fields were rearranged in a trait object pointer, I would expect that if either of the pointer fields were null, then the trait object pointer itself would be considered null. Thus, this strategy would still work.\n\nAlso, is there a good reason why the data pointer would not be the first field of a fat pointer struct? It makes a lot of sense given optimizations; not having the data pointer be the first field would mean that most data dereferences of a fat pointer would need to first perform an arithmetic operation to locate the data pointer field.\n\nTo my knowledge this patch is correct given the current implementation and near to far future plans. Progress on fixing the ICE has not been quick, and blocking this commit would mean that `is_null` remains broken.\n",

    "body": "We discussed this a bit on IRC, but I don't think that we should be adding an `impl` of `PtrExt` for all unsized `T`. Other unsized types include `str`, all trait objects, `Path`, `OsStr`, etc, and we don't want to add an `impl` for all of them.\n\nIn the long run this will likely need some form of compiler intrinsic to extract the actual pointer from `*const T` regardless of whether `T` is sized or not.\n",
