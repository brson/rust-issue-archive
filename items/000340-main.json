  "body": "This patch implements module export, at least for the most basic cases. Please look at it and see if I'm on the right track. There may be more work yet for tag variants and native modules, and it doesn't do anything about crate exports.\n\nThe implementation looks inefficient since it loops over the view_items every time name lookup encounters a module, but it doesn't seem to have much impact on stage1 build times so I'm not that concerned.\n",
