    "body": "Thanks for the PR @P1start! We currently, however, require an RFC to modify the macro system (small though this may be). The story around macros ever-developing, and at this time we would like to put more time and discussion into modifications than just a PR to the rust repository itself.\n\nWe're also quite hesitant to extend the macro system much farther without having a clear design going forward, as opposed to patching it up here and there as we go along.\n\nIn light of this, I'm going to close this PR, but you may of course feel free to open an RFC.\n",
