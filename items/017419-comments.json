    "body": "I'm not in favour of this just yet, at least until we have (a plan for) an equivalent way to disable optimisations with the Rust makeflies. If you want to build something unoptimised the choices are `make <target> RUSTFLAGS='-Z no-opt'`, or extracting the correct compiler invocations and removing the `-O` flags, the former is definitely easier. (Reconfiguring with `--disable-optimize` doesn't quite do the same thing, since that would require redoing the whole bootstrap without optimisation, while `RUSTFLAGS` allows for a quicker edit-compile cycle.)\n\nIf, e.g., the Rust makefiles removed the `-O` flag when passed `NO_OPT`, or set `--opt-level` to `n` when given `OPT_LEVEL=n` then this is good. (This handling all seems to be around line 111 of `mk/main.mk`, if you feel like tackling it.)\n",
