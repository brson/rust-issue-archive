    "body": "I downloaded most recent 64-bit nightly about 30 minutes ago from the website and installed it. I usually don't remove old versions and install new version over the old one (I guess installer replaces files i destination directory). I'm running Windows 10 64-bit version. I guess I will try to uninstall old nightly first and then install new nightly again.\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/723258/10765169/28827dbc-7cda-11e5-85c5-0ee8992aea27.PNG)\n",
