    "body": "I'm a little worried that this is a lot of code to support a not-too-common case. Is there precedent for having these options in the `deriving` syntax? All I know is that Haskell has `deriving`, but I know very little Haskell and a cursory search didn't come up with much.\n\nI'm ok with implementing custom behavior myself, but I may not be a good sample of the opinion at large. Regardless, I'm not sure that `test_order` is completely necessary. I'd imagine that the common use-case of this would be for ignoring fields or inverting comparisons on fields, but I'd think that it'd be pretty rare you'd want to have one `test_order` for one trait and one for another (I could be wrong though).\n",

If one has special needs for how Eq is implemented, then it isn't that painful to write it by hand.\n\nThe linked issue provides little justification that this is warranted. This is another compiler-integrated feature that will need to be specced, but will it ever be used, and will the amount of use it gets justify the complexity? I'm not convinced.\n",

I'm happy to simplify (e.g. removing `test_order`), if necessary; it just seems very annoying to sometime have a single field that needs to be ignored, and thus unable to use `#[deriving]` even though the rest is so mechanical & boiler-plate-y.\n\n(FWIW, I'm pretty sure Haskell _doesn't_ support anything like this for its `deriving`.)\n",
