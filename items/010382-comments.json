    "body": "> Right, and I take it that we want to ensure that there is no vtable even when we don't monomorphize.\n\nI don't understand what you mean here. This issue is about avoiding a virtual call, not the entire vtable, which is necessary (and having `TypeId` as a field in the vtable is probably the best we can do).\n\n> How would `trait_object.CONST` work? I may be missing something, but that looks much more like duck typing than any kind of polymorphism I have seen in Rust.\n\nAssuming the following definition compiles, `Trait` should be object-safe:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Trait {\n    fn method(&self) -> char;\n    const CONST: char where Self: Sized;\n}\n```\n\nThen one could imagine the vtable to also contain `CONST`, i.e.:\n\n``` rust\nstruct VtableForTrait {\n    dtor: unsafe fn(*mut u8),\n    size: usize,\n    align: usize,\n    method: unsafe fn(*const u8) -> char,\n    // The above fields are present in current Rust, only CONST below is new:\n    CONST: char\n}\n```\n\nAnd let's add some impls:\n\n``` rust\nstruct A;\nimpl Trait for A {\n    fn method(&self) -> char { 'A' }\n    const CONST: char = 'A';\n}\nstruct B;\nimpl Trait for B {\n    fn method(&self) -> char { 'B' }\n    const CONST: char = 'B';\n}\n```\n\n`<Trait as Trait>::CONST` would still be missing, because there's no way to supply the actual trait object to get the original `CONST` value from the `impl` (of `Trait` for `A` or `B`, in this case).\n\nMethods don't have this problem: we could call `method` via `trait_object.method()`, which is really sugar for `<Trait as Trait>::method(trait_object)`, and that will go through the vtable of `trait_object`.\n\nHowever, we don't want the cost of calling a method through a vtable, especially if we can just load `CONST` instead, so what we're missing is a way to get `CONST` from `trait_object` (of type `&Trait`).\n\nAnd what I'm proposing is to just use `trait_object.CONST`:\n\n``` rust\nlet trait_objects: [&Trait; 2] = [&A, &B];\nassert_eq!(trait_objects[0].CONST, 'A');\nassert_eq!(trait_objects[1].CONST, 'B');\n```\n",
