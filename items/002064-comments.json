    "body": "So, I've already worked around this issue in my uv_tcp branch (the sockaddr_in is passed by-ref into C from rust, huzzah).\n\nBut you can repro the behavior I'm describing by:\n- be on windows (I wonder if this is an issue in linux, as well?)\n- `git clone git://github.com/olsonjeffery/rust`\n- checking out the `uv_tcp` branch\n- and checking out back to `80f1d676` , which is the commit immediately preceeding my workaround.\n- If then you do `make check-stage1-std TESTNAME=test_uv_tcp` , you'll see the test hang because the on_connect_cb\n  is null and/or because the provided sockaddr_in to rustrt::rust_uv_tcp_connect() is garbage, once we get into C. The current printf debugging in that commit only shows the bad port val (it'll be different than the previous printfs showing its\n  value after the sockaddr_in is created.. the value of sin_port is usually `20480` for when `uv_ip4_addr` is provided `80` for its port arg) .. but an additional printf will show that the provided uv_connect_cb is, in fact, equal to 0.\n",

It is completing the entire C func (both printf's are fire).. but we don't successfully return to Rust (the println() immediately after the call to rust_uv_buf_init() is never processed)\n2. The `char* base`, once in C, is clobbered (notice that it went from an actual value to being `0x3` .. hm). I'm curious if this isn't something of my doing, as it seems like enough of a problem that it'd appear in other bindings and cause much havoc.\n",
