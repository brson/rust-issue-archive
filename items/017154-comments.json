    "body": "@huonw My bad, I overlooked the fact that [`Vec` implements `Index`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.index).\n\nI can indeed read [vec.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcollections/vec.rs) but I wanted you to clarify how the built-in `array` types are semantically different from `Vec`.  Then we will understand `array` better;  `Vec` + (`array` - `Vec`) = `array`, you know.\n\nIncidentally, please note that good programming languages shouldn't force a programmer to distinguish built-in types and library types.  Programmers praise Lisp and Smalltalk and badmouth Java partly because of that.  My understanding is that the `array` type is unique in Rust that it is parametrized by its element type **and** its size (compare Rust traits with C++ templates which can also accept compile-time constant integers.)  The official documents should do their best to minimize newcomers' surprise on that.\n\nI hope this issue is regarded as a showstopper for 1.0.\n",
