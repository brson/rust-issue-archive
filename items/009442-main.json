  "body": "This implements an `FindIterator` with `.find_iter()` and `.find_rev_iter()` on string slices that works like `.find()` and `.rfind()`, but returns all matches instead of just the first one.\n\nThis touches upon a few other design questions I'm having of the string library:\n- In https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9392, I'm trying to normalize the names for operations that operate starting from the back to `_rev`, which has met some resistance. This PR would allow removing at least `find()` and `rfind()` completely and replace them with this Iterator. \n- If we drop the reverse iterator constructors (DoubleEndedIterators already offer an method for inverting them), we'd also remove a lot of repetition and the `_rev` suffix completly - see https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9391.\n- The resulting `\"foo\".find_iter('o').nth(0)` and `\"foo\".find_iter('f').invert().nth(0)` would become quite long though, which touches on https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9440.\n\n---\n\nAlso as part of this PR I'm moving `str::CharEq` to `char::CharEq`, introduce a new trait `ToChar`, and implement them both for `ascii::Ascii`.\n\nI'm doing the movement of `CharEq` because it seems to me that even though it's being intended to be used by string functions, the actual trait encapsulates something relevant for chars in general. And `str.rs` needs any chance it can get to become shorter. ;)\n\nThe `ToChar` trait is necessary for the implementation of `FindIterator` to not include two almost identical copies of the same function in both `next()` and `next_back()`\n",
