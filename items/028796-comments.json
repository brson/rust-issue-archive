    "body": "@Charlesetc `Box<Fn()>` and `Box<FnMut()>` can both be called without a problem, because they don't require destructuring the box they're in; they only need `&self` or `&mut self`, respectively, which totally works with the current deref coercions. Which of the closure traits, `Fn(), FnMut(),` or `FnOnce()`, is implemented for a specific closure is determined by inference.\n\n`Box<FnOnce()>` is a challenge because it takes `self` by-value, which means it needs to be moved out of the `Box` and onto the stack to be executed, but this doesn't work in current Rust because there's no stable way to move out of (destructure) a `Box`. The `DerefMove` trait proposed in the RFC @eefriedman linked would make this work, but the design of it is still being worked on.\n\nThe key here is that `Box<FnOnce()>` _does_ have a known size, but it's hidden behind the `Box` pointer so that anything implementing `FnOnce`, _regardless of its size_, can fit in the same spot. The v-table in the trait object directs the processor to the concrete implementation of the trait (in this case, the closure body) for that specific object.  All the details about the object, its size, fields, etc., are coded into that implementation.\n",

The in-tree copy has the benefit of \"being variadic\" and having the paren sugar in bounds.\n2. The in-tree copy could be deprecated and a crates.io crate could provide a suite of traits like `FnBox1`, `FnBox2`, etc. This has the benefit of not polluting the standard library but is less ergonomic to use.\n\nWe're a little undecided on which route to take, so some comments would be welcome!\n",

We have enough micro-crates in the ecosystem and this is a common enough pattern that it's worth supporting in the stdlib.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I do have a use for this. I need it for one-off callbacks in [wingui](https://github.com/cybergeek94/wingui). Right now I'm having to [wrap `FnOnce` callbacks in an `Option` and move it into an `FnMut` closure](https://github.com/cybergeek94/wingui/blob/master/src/window.rs#L150) so I can call it from a box.

I have produced a gist to demonstrate what i believe to be going on.\n\nhttps://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=aa96e9e0fe78a09af2eb&version=nightly\nhttps://gist.github.com/aa96e9e0fe78a09af2eb\n\nI am not sure of the future of FnBox, (certainly would love to see a full blown `Box<FnOnce>` implementation if under review for a 1.6 release), but in the interim, I wonder if its possible to address this specifically to bring things inline.\n\nThanks all\n",

    "body": "I think I would stabilize this, personally. My reasoning is:\n1. Anything we can do to make things more ergonomic here is good, until such time as `Box<FnOnce()>` works properly. \n2. The original idea of `FnBox` was that it would serve as a place-holder for where you would use `Box<FnOnce>` such that, in the glorious future, you can basically `s/FnBox/FnOnce/` and Everything Just Works. I think this is mostly true now. This will be rather untrue if we move things to a crates.io crate. Obviously I don't really expect anyone to run `sed`, but I think having `FnBox` work as much like `FnOnce` as we can makes it easier to explain to newcomers: \"ah, `Box<FnOnce>` doesn't quite work yet, but you can do `Box<FnBox>` for now, and it mostly works the same except that it requires a box\".\n\nBasically, our story here is not great, but I don't see any reason to make it worse, just to avoid a deprecated item in the standard library.\n",

    "body": "The libs team discussed this during triage yesterday and the decision was to **stabilize**. @bluss brought up a good point, however, that `Box<FnMut<A>>` doesn't implement `FnMut<A>` for coherence reasons related to `FnBox` which may be good to sort out, however. Concretely, an impl like\n\n``` rust\nimpl<F: ?Sized, A> FnMut<A> for Box<F> where F: FnMut<A> {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\ndoes not work. An impl of `FnMut` requires an impl of `Fn` which in turn requires an impl of `FnOnce`:\n\n``` rust\nimpl<F: ?Sized, A> FnOnce<A> for Box<F> where F: FnOnce<A> {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nUnfortunately this impl can't be written for two reasons:\n1. Unsized types by value don't work, so we can't use `.call_once` or `*` to move out of the box if `F: ?Sized`.\n2. This impl is a coherence violation with `FnOnce<A> for Box<FnBox<A>>`.\n",

    "body": "Ok, so I'm wary to stabilize `FnBox` if it prevents us from later having the impls for `Box<FnMut()>` to also implement `FnMut()`, and to drill down a bit I've come up with [this small sample](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=f1e571c5af8b840aeb4a&version=nightly):\n\n``` rust\n#![crate_type = \"lib\"]\n#![feature(fundamental)]\n\n#[fundamental]\ntrait FnBox<A> {}\n#[fundamental]\ntrait FnOnce<A> {}\n\nstruct Box<T: ?Sized>(T);\n\nimpl<A> FnOnce<A> for Box<FnBox<A>> {}\n\nimpl<F: FnOnce<A> + ?Sized, A> FnOnce<A> for Box<F> {}\n```\n\nThis represents basically the traits that are in play here, but doesn't worry about the unsized types by value problem. Currently this code yields a coherence violation:\n\n```\n<anon>:11:1: 11:39 error: conflicting implementations for trait `FnOnce` [E0119]\n<anon>:11 impl<A> FnOnce<A> for Box<FnBox<A>> {}\n          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<anon>:11:1: 11:39 help: see the detailed explanation for E0119\n<anon>:13:1: 13:55 note: note conflicting implementation here\n<anon>:13 impl<F: FnOnce<A> + ?Sized, A> FnOnce<A> for Box<F> {}\n          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nYet I would think that because of the `fundamental` attribute the compiler _should_ be able to know that the type `FnBox<A>` does not implement `FnOnce<A>` so the two impls can never overlap. @nikomatsakis mentioned that #19032 may come into play here.\n\nFor now I'm not going to stabilize `FnBox` while we sort this out, but it's certainly a candidate for backporting quickly!\n",

The coherence error [in my comment above](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28796#issuecomment-161733781) is something that we're specifically concerned about.\n\n@nikomatsakis, do you have any thoughts here about that setup?

    "body": "@alexcrichton so I investigated the coherence error you were [describing in this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28796#issuecomment-161733781). As I suspected initially, the problem is due to #19032. In particular, coherence is required to check that, for all types `A`:\n\n```\nFnBox<A>: !FnOnce<A>\n```\n\n(Here I am using the notation from RFC rust-lang/rfcs#1148.) Normally, it would be able to conclude this, because:\n- there is no impl of `FnOnce` for `FnBox`; and,\n-  `FnBox` is a crate-local type OR `FnOnce` is fundamental (hence negative reasoning is allowed)\n\nHowever, it decides that even despite that, it can't say for certain, because it fears that some other crate will come along with an impl like this:\n\n``` rust\n// downstream crate:\nstruct MyStruct;\nimpl FnOnce<MyStruct> for FnBox<MyStruct> { }\n```\n\nNow, in fact, attempting to define such an impl fails the orphan check http://is.gd/e8tZc9. (Interestingly, I think it fails the orphan check precisely _because_ `FnBox` is not currently declared fundamental, which means that the author of `FnBox` reserves the right to add more impls, basically, including an impl for all `T`.)\n\nI've been thinking for some time that we could fix #19032 if we made better advantage of the orphan rules. In particular, the current overlap checking code predates fundamental and does not understand the limitations that the orphan check is imposing (as we can see above). However, I think what I would like to do is to make those improvements in tandem with an improved version of negative reasoning like rust-lang/rfcs#1148. (Note to self: write some more comments on that RFC with latest thinking.)\n\nI'm not yet sure what my conclusion is from this investigation. On the one hand, I'm 95% sure that there doesn't have to be a coherence issue here. On the other hand, I'm 5% uncertain, and I'd feel better if we resolved that 5% uncertainty before we stabilized `FnBox`.\n",

    "body": "With the recent impl Trait stabilization, is there anything new to discuss? I figure that impl Trait alone, especially in its current conservative form, is far from obviating the need for FnBox (though at least now we can return FnOnce from functions and call them), but given how many years it's been since this issue was opened I figure it's worth getting a survey of what the current thinking is. For example, would extending impl Trait to type position solve all of this (i.e. `struct Foo { x: impl FnOnce() }`, `let v: Vec<impl FnOnce() = ...` (hm, I suppose there's some problems with that last one :P )), or are we still looking towards additional mechanisms like `&move` or \"by-value DST\" (which I don't remember ever even seeing an RFC for...)?",

    "body": "One thing to consider: given that we already overload the call operator to different methods depending on type (`call`, `call_mut`, `call_once`), would it be feasible to take the `call_box` method from `FnBox`, stick it into the `FnOnce` trait, and have the compiler itself distinguish between `call_once` and `call_box` like it already does for the other closure calling methods? It would make it so that every `Box<FnOnce>` would be immediately callable today without anyone using a different/unstable type, and since `call_box` would remain hidden behind the call operator we wouldn't need to stabilize anything (and it's not like the Fn methods are going to be stable anytime in the foreseeable future anyway). It may not make it possible to move out of a `Box<FnOnce>`, but it's not like it's possible to move out of a `Box<Fn>` either, and it would let us deprecate FnBox. Thoughts?",

    "body": "@kennytm I don't think there's any use case for `Rc<FnOnce>`, because you wouldn't be able to do anything with it unless the refcount is 1, which is sort of against the point of Rc. AFAICT it would be equivalent in behavior to having some code in a destructor on Foo and then doing `Rc<Foo>`. And I don't think that `PinMut<FnOnce>` makes sense either, because you'd never be able to call it since AFAIK it's basically &mut FnOnce, which also can't be called.\r\n\r\nGeneralizing this to other potential smart pointers, the underlying problem here is that there's no way at all to store a FnOnce that allows it to be called. If `Box<FnOnce>` ever works, it means that, in the worst-case scenario, they would just do `Blah<Box<FnOnce>>` rather than just `Blah<FnOnce>`. That seems like it would be an acceptable temporary situation until a proper solution was found, rather than coming up with a menagerie of new Fn traits.",

    "body": "Precisely, but (and this is probably getting off-topic) I was curious whether or not we would want to make all anonymous `impl Foo` types be considered interchangeable iff, for each specific trait Foo, they have the same size; this would (among other things) let `Vec<impl Trait>` work both technically and conceptually, and would let us do `let v: Vec<impl FnBox>`  as long as each closure inserted into `v` closed over elements whose sizes come to the same sum (e.g. a vector could contain multiple closures if they all close over nothing). Of course this still wouldn't let anyone *use* those closures until we had unsized rvalues... but at the same time it would make unsized rvalues strictly more useful as well. Anyway, I'm still curious whether my above proposal to make `call_box` special (temporarily) would suffice for most of this.",
