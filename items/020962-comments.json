    "body": "I have been poking around improvements to rustdoc for this.\r\n\r\nFirst, for the ownership page: long since moved, but checking the stats for [Understanding Ownership: What is Ownership?](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html) gives us an overall Mobile 73, Desktop 95. So, better, even though it's a much more complex page now! Nice. It still recommends \"Eliminate render-blocking resources\" and \"Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy\" though.\r\n\r\nBut I have been focused on `std`'s API docs and referencing [Iterator's page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) as a particularly problematic case in terms of doc rendering times.\r\n\r\n\"Core Web Vitals\" have been added to PageSpeed Insights.\r\n* First Contentful Paint: Important.\r\n* Largest Contentful Paint: Important.\r\n* First Input Delay: scrolling/zooming are not covered by FID, so not a big concern.\r\n* Cumulative Layout Shift: Maybe? Great layout shifts long after loading are bad, but for Rust's API docs that's mostly about making sure core fonts get loaded quickly. Painting speed and legibility should come well before CLS.\r\n\r\n### Field Data\r\nThis is gathered from recent visits that Chrome's telemetry reports, basically.\r\n\r\n#### Mobile\r\n> The Chrome User Experience Report does not have sufficient real-world speed data for this page.\r\n> Origin Summary: Over the last 30 days, all pages served from this origin pass the Core Web Vitals assessment. To view suggestions tailored to each page, analyze individual page URLs.\r\n\r\n| Metric | Average | % Good | % Needs Improvement | % Poor |\r\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\r\n| First Contentful Paint (FCP) | 0.8s | 83% | 15% | 2% |\r\n| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | 1s | 97% | 2% | 1% |\r\n| First Input Delay (FID) | 14ms | 95% | 4% | 1% |\r\n| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) | 0 | 89% | 7% | 4% |\r\n\r\n#### Desktop\r\n> (Over the last 30 days, field data shows that this page does not pass the Core Web Vitals assessment.)\r\n\r\n| Metric | Average | % Good | % Needs Improvement | % Poor |\r\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\r\n| First Contentful Paint (FCP) | 0.5s | 94% | 5% | 1% |\r\n| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | 1s | 97% | 2% | 1% |\r\n| First Input Delay (FID) | 19ms | 85% | 10% | 4% |\r\n| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) | 0.42 | 16% | 3% | 81% |\r\n\r\n### Lab Data\r\nIt should be noted that Lab Data and most diagnostics are not consistent between runs of PageSpeed Insights. I ran it a few times and took a median.\r\n| Metric | Mobile | Desktop |\r\n| --- | ---: | ---: |\r\n| Overall Score | 41 | 79 |\r\n| First Contentful Paint | 1.8s | 1.0s | \r\n| Speed Index | 2.7s | 1.0s |\r\n| Largest Contentful Paint | 7.2s | 2.2s |\r\n| Time to Interactive | 9.3s | 2.3s | \r\n| Total Blocking Time | 1850ms | 160ms | \r\n| Cumulative Layout Shift | 0 | 0.445 |\r\n\r\nAs we can see, CLS mostly _exists_ on screens that are bigger, FID is low, TBT is not great, but our FCP is good and our LCP could use improvement.\r\n\r\n#### Opportunities & Diagnostics\r\n| Metric | Resources | Mobile | Desktop |\r\n| ---- | --- | ---: | ---: |\r\n| Eliminate render-blocking resources | -- | 0.86s | 0.36s |\r\n| Ensure text remains visible during webfont load | -- | 150ms | 160ms |\r\n| Remove unused JavaScript | 8 kb | 0.15s | -- |\r\n| Avoid an excessive DOM size | 14,545 elements | -- | -- |\r\n| Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy | 22 resources | -- | -- |\r\n| Minimize main-thread work | -- | 6.3s | -- |\r\n| Avoid chaining critical requests | 15 chains | 510ms | 590ms |\r\n| Keep request counts low and transfer sizes small | 23 requests; 1,038 KB | -- | -- |",

    "body": "Mostly rustdoc is about typography. Improving font loading may be the biggest win in _actual_ performance (I notice a long block when loading a page in actual usage, which goes away when I twiddle with the CSS to use `font-display` options, but my initial PR... might have gone a bit far).\r\n\r\nThe `std` API docs apparently don't get a ton of mobile visitors since browsing several \"obvious\" pages that might be referenced even on mobile doesn't get per-page Field Data. Likewise with https://docs.rs/rand, which is surprising, though https://docs.rs itself does. So, if that's correct, then mostly whatever is a problem on both desktop and mobile should be a concern. Anything that improves both.\r\n\r\n[Cache-Control headers] are still needed on the server configuration side.\r\nDoing something cleverer re: resource arrangement and loading might help.\r\nDoing something cleverer re: html/CSS (to minimize the DOM size) might help.\r\n\r\n[Cache-Control headers]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control",
