    "body": "Thanks!  Very enlightening points of view.  This is a sticky issue indeed.\n\nIf you will allow me to add my 2 cents as a newbie and potential adopter of Rust in \"real life\" in the near future.\n1. I am impressed with what I have seen of Rust's internal implementation so far.  Rust macros rock.\n2. If I understand correctly... Rust's philosophy is a departure from the \"unsafety\" of C/C++ to the \"safety\" partly thorough compile-time checks?  I think the proposal to return an Option is the best alternative to promote the concept of \"safety\"  rather than producing a runtime panick.\n3. Runtime check producing a panick & crash for common operations like abs() does not feel very safe for newbies, most of whom are by definition polyglots looking at Rust through the filter of their understanding of other C-like languages but may have possibly dabbled with Haskell or Ocaml.  Developers from primarily C/C++/Java background will likely (possibly unknowingly) intuitively expect abs(min_value()) to return min_value(), but not cause a crash.  I only accidentally discovered I would have built a timebomb into my app when trying abs(i32::MIN) as part of my Rust learning process.\n4. For complex dynamic systems (I am thinking about robot sensor input), the sequence of events that lead to producing the data that causes `abs` to panick could be difficult to reproduce... especially with limited debugger support on some platforms.\n5. Returning an Option would force the developer to explicitly decide (presumably using a match) how they want to handle either Some or None return value, so they aren't surprised by runtime panick.\n6. In practice, with an Option return value I would probably implement my own `safe_abs` helper function returning `i32::MIN` when `abs` returns `None`.  I would use `safe_abs` in 99% of my applications. By the same token, now that I know how `abs` behaves currently... it is not a big deal to instead just have my `safe_abs` pre-check `if value == min_value()` and return `i32::MIN`, otherwise return `abs(value)`.  Either way `safe_abs` would perform exactly how I would have expected `abs` to work coming from other language backgrounds, and I don't have to worry about the panick situation anymore.  I can always decide when to deal with `i32::MIN` return result from `safe_abs` in those parts of my code where it matters.\n7. Even without changing `abs`, I agree that a thorough documentation of `abs` may be sufficient for 1.0.0 release to avoid tagging abs() as unstable.  Assuming developers (especially newbies) read the docs :-O  You may want to add the `abs` panick behavior or the \"new overflow semantics\" Alex mentioned in general to the FAQ as well.  This will be a source of angst for many newbies.\n8. Classifying `abs` as unstable would be a big put-off to new adopters in my opinion.  Many will ask...  \"what do you mean you haven't even decided in rev 1.0.0 how to implement something as simple as abs() yet?\"\n9. Not sure I am a fan of `abs` returning an unsigned value for reasons others mentioned.  Also I think it muddies up an otherwise elegant & cohesive set of macros y'all are using to implement the i8/16/32/64 variations (kudos to the Rust team on the implementation by the way).  Returning unsigned value only makes sense as an \"ivory tower\" argument, but pragmatically speaking nearly every library I've used (POSIX C, C#, Java, Haskell, Ocaml) returns the same type as the input argument.\n10. I can't pass up the obvious Haskell \"zen moment\", since (as usual) the Haskell prelude says it most succinctly and elegantly...\n\n``` haskell\nabs :: a -> a \n```\n",

    "body": "OK... I should have looked at `master` branch's implementation of `abs`, which has been improved compared to 1.0.0-beta.5 and in fact should return `i32::MIN` when I call `i32::MIN.abs()`.  Not sure why it was changed, but `master` should exhibit the behavior as documented.  I am building nightly now so I can test this theory.\n\nSo this may not be a documentation issue with 1.0.0-beta.5 after all, but rather something that was changed/fixed subsequently in the master and not back-ported to 1.0.0-beta.5.  The proposed change to `abs` in my original post above (adding some variation of `&& self != $T::min_value()` check) would cause 1.0.0-beta.5 to behave the same way as the master branch without having to backport the entirety of the new wrapping_neg and overflowing_neg implementation into 1.0.0-beta.5, and eliminate the panic for `i32::MIN.abs()`.  And then the documentation would be correct as well.\n\nHere is the code from `master` to which I am referring:\n\nlibcore/num/mod.rs:570\n\n``` rust\npub fn abs(self) -> $T {\n    if self.is_negative() {\n        self.wrapping_neg()\n    } else {\n        self\n    }\n}\n```\n\nlibcore/num/mod.rs:1068\n\n``` rust\npub fn wrapping_neg(self) -> $T {\n    self.overflowing_neg().0\n}\n```\n\nlibcore/num/wrapping.rs:231\n\n``` rust\nfn overflowing_neg(self) -> ($t, bool) {\n    if self == $t::MIN {\n        ($t::MIN, true)\n    } else {\n        (-self, false)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhat do you think? Am I headed down the right path with my investigation here, or just wasting my time?\n\nWill post my results after I finish my testing with nightly later this evening.\n",

    "body": "@pnkfelix the `wrapping_neg` function does not exist in the beta branch, so this sounds like it's a bug in beta (not using `wrapping_add`). If we want this function to explicitly not panic (which is fine by me), then it sounds like this was just a mistake in backporting.\n\nOverall it sounds like the behavior on nightly is as intended (using wrapping semantics and not panicking), and the behavior on beta is a mistake because it's using `+ 1` instead of `.wrapping_add(1)`. At this point it's too late to backport to beta, so I'm going to close this as \"fixed\" :)\n\nSorry for giving you the runaround @econoplas!\n",

    "body": "Not a problem.  Thanks for looking into this and listening to my noobie feedback!  And for not laughing at my ignorance :-)\n\nConfirmed that the code from my original post above works with no panic with 1.1.0-dev nightly 20150513.\n\nI am OK with closing this without resolving the strange `abs` behavior in 1.0.0.\n\nBut I should mention what started me down this path to begin with was my 1.0.0-beta.5 build crashed in `abs` on CentOS 6.5 with gcc 4.9.2 which I built myself from source.  I chalked it up to some bone-head mistake on my part.\n\nBut that also led me to investigate why `abs` was misbehaving and submitting this issue as a result.  I will try to reproduce on CentOS 6.5 again and maybe file a separate issue.\n\nMy concern is that if `abs` is possibly used in other library code (such as in hashmap), then user programs might experience a crash if they insert an item whose hash value evaluates to i32::MIN into a hashmap.  I would need to read a bunch of code or try to come up with test cases for various containers to see if I can trigger this behavior.\n\nKnowing what I know now about the issue submittal process, I wish I would have kept the stack trace from my failed 1.0.0-beta.5 compile on CentOS 6.5.  I will try to reproduce the build crashing in `abs` again.\n\nThanks again!\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the update!  I tracked down the place in the 1.0.0 code where i32::MIN::abs() was causing compilation from source to panic compiling stage1 libcore, and verified it still occurs with the 1.0.0 release.\n\nSee #25492 which includes my analysis as well as a patch.\n\nI also spent a couple of hours searching for all possible calls to MIN::abs() and reading those sections of code, and this was the only place I could find where MIN::abs() is explicitly called.\n\nThe thought being that if MIN::abs() in 1.0.0 is still vulnerable to panic behaviour, then someone should look at all calls to abs() in the code base to see if any obvious panics will occur.\n\nHopefully I didn't miss any :-)\n",
