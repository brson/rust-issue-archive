    "body": "I'm a little unsure of how serious we want to get with this, but I know that with libuv they attempt to parse the path on windows as well, and apparently it's not as easy as just splitting on semicolons (right now their path parsing causes an [infinite loop](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/909)).\n\nIf we do take this route, I fear that we'll eventually get a bug reporting saying that we're not parsing the windows paths correctly.\n\nOne route to take would be to only define the separator in libstd (which I think is done in `std::path`), and another route would be true path parsing for windows (I'm unsure if unix has the same ability). What do you think?\n",

    "body": "Ugh windows! I presumed simple split works because gcc does for `LIBRARY_PATH` parsing, but it seems that `PATH` is more complicated.\n[posix says](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html) `PATH` is colon-separated so I think it's safe for unix.\nOn Windows, it seems that there is no concrete documentation of its syntax. libuv needs full emulation because they have to do it, but we don't. I started to think this patch doesn't provide good use cases to require such effort, so I'm closing this unless good reason is found. :-)\n\nOn the other hand, we may have to clarify what `RUST_PATH` syntax is. It is currently different to (and better than) `PATH` syntax on Windows.\n",
