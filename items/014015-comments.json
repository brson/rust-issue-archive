I think we could find a way to do that without using raw byte indices. It was just much more convenient to do it that way. (This skipping requires no backtracking. If the prefix is never found, then the regex can't match.)\n",

    "body": "That is indeed pretty grim. I don't think it's acceptable for `match|find|captures` to always allocate---that will kill performance. I also think adding methods for streams is pretty lousy. That leaves us with... this gross thing:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Regexable<'a, T: Iterator<char>> {\n    fn scannable(&self) -> MaybeIterator<'a, T>;\n}\nenum MaybeIterator<'a, T> {\n    Iter(T),\n    Slice(&'a str),\n}\n```\n\nThen provide impls for the right types. Then the methods could return `MaybeOwned`, using a slice whenever the input uses a slice.\n\nBut yeah, this is going to be harder than I thought. In the iterator's case, we need a way to accrue the matched text. The VM is fundamentally built on the notion of returning _indices_ into an existing string, and the notion simply doesn't work with streams. So that would have to be gutted.\n\nThis is a bigger change I thought. Damn.\n",

    "body": "I just took a look at [Go's regexp](http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/) package. They have some functions that work on streams, but they are a bit crippled. Firstly, there is only the equivalent of `match|find|captures` and it _only_ returns the byte indices in the stream. Secondly, there's no \"All\" variant (the equivalent of `find_iter` and `captures_iter`).\n\nThe most interesting bit there is that the regexp functions on readers finds precisely one match and returns byte indices into that stream. In the Go world, if I wanted to use that and actually retrieve the text, I'd write my own \"middleware\" reader to save text as its being read. Then I could use that after the first match to grab the matched text. Then reset the \"middleware\" reader and start searching again.\n\nThe problem with that approach: what if there's never a match? You'd end up piling the whole stream into memory (likely defeating the purpose of using a stream).\n\nHmm. Am I missing anything? Are there any other implementations of regex searching on streams?\n",
