    "body": "I'm a little uncomfortable with this. There is no mention of any concrete improvement in this pull request or the comments, so it's unclear to me why we want this by default. Additionally, from a man page I found:\n\n> If level is a numeric values greater than zero ld optimizes the output. This might take significantly longer and therefore probably should only be enabled for the final binary. At the moment this option only affects ELF shared library generation. Future releases of the linker may make more use of this option. Also currently there is no difference in the linker's behaviour for different non-zero values of this option. Again this may change with future releases. \n\nWhich sounds like it's recommending that we do _not_ use this for libraries, but only for binaries. It appears that this pull request is unconditionally running it with optimizations.\n\nWhat's the main reason for adding this? I don't want to just run optimizations to run optimizations. I just want to make sure that we have a clear benefit from this. Additionally, does clang do this at all? Is there precedent for this?\n",
