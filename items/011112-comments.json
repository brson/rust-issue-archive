    "body": "Renaming it to a try_recv_opt that returns Option<Option<T>> seems a better approach, as it doesn't introduce an extra enum type, and follows the simple logic that a nonblocking version of a function (try_recv_opt vs recv_opt in this case) wraps the result of the blocking function in an Option, which allows to convert code between the blocking and non-blocking versions in a straightforward fashion.\n\nAlso, Result is supposed to be used for things were it is reasonable to fail! on any error, and it is of course usually not appropriate to fail! on a non-blocking function not returning input yet (that leads to random timing/scheduler dependent failures unless there's some extra serialization to prevent it).\n\nBTW, maybe changing recv_opt to return Result<T, ()> instead of Option<T> might make sense, but that's orthogonal.\n",
