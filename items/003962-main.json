  "body": "With this code I've seen some intermittent failures when running `make -j8 check`. pcwalton seems to think this is to do with some parallel check going wrong, as I can't seem to reproduce the errors with just a usual `make check` (but they're nondeterministic errors in the first place, so that doesn't really say much). So there could be something lurking in here, but it's beyond my ken to track it down.\n",
