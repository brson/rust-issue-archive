    "body": "I am a big fan of this general idea.  I think we should use generic types where it makes sense: in particular the deref interface should be something like `fn get(k: K) -> V`, so that it works with maps.  But it makes sense even for operators like `+` and `*` if you plan to stretch their numeric meaning a bit:\n\n```\ninter mul<R, V> {\n    fn mul(r: R) -> V;\n}\n```\n\nwould allow\n\n```\nimpl of mul<int, str> for str {\n    fn mul(times: int) -> str {\n        let base = self;\n        uint::range(1, times) {|| base += self; }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nyou could then write `\" \"*15`, as you can in Python.  The danger is that it opens the door to implicit numeric coercions, but at least users have to write those themselves rather than us doing it for them.\n\nHowever, I think the fact that one must implement _all_ `core:num` or _none_ is not so appealing.  I'd rather have the individual operators broken out into individual interfaces and then a `core:num` group interface.  I can certainly think of things that are addable but not subtractable (strings and vectors) and so forth.\n\nI guess it depends a bit on whether we intend for these operators to be used _strictly_ for their analogous purposes or whether we intend to allow nicer notation for a few other cases.  I say _intend_ because people _will_ use them for other things beyond numerics and lists whatever we do, but I guess we can make it more painful for them if we want to.\n",

    "body": "> I can certainly think of things that are addable but not subtractable (strings and vectors) and so forth.\n\nI guess this is a matter of taste. I like operators to mean one thing and only one thing -- I think Haskell's `Num` class gets it right. But since Rust is already abusing + for vector concatenation, I'm okay with supporting separate interfaces and allowing people to do more free-form things.\n",
