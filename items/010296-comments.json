    "body": "First, +1. I find the current state pretty confusing, perhaps because `proc` isn't mentioned in the documentation at all. The following fails to compile (obviously):\n\n```\nfn call_once(action: proc() -> T) -> T {\n    action()\n}\n\nfn consume_owned(_text: ~str) {}\nfn used_borrowed(_text: &int) {}\n\nfn lets_try(foo: &int, bar: ~str, baz: &mut_int) {\n    mut int qux = 0;\n    do call_once {\n        used_borrowed(foo);\n        consume_owned(bar);\n        *baz += 1;\n        qux += 1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by `proc:` - putting `proc:` instead of `proc` in the above doesn't compile. So how is it possible (today) to make the above work?\n",

    "body": "@pcwalton ran into something a little related yesterday. All of the runtime's I/O structures are wrappers around some `~Trait` object. The idea of these is that they're all sendable across tasks (one can read while the other writes, etc). Specifically, though, the `Freeze` bound couldn't get inferred for those objects, and having to specify the `Send` bound everywhere would be a bit of a pain (although entirely plausible).\n\nThis may just be a reflection of the runtime's decision to use trait objects instead of generics, but it would make some use cases a little harder. That being said, I'd almost want to lean on the side of consistence and not have any funny bounds inferred for you when you didn't want them.\n",

    "body": "Incidentally, this issue caused me a bunch of pain when I was trying to implement a generic trait over objects that contained references (In my case, `Matcher<T>`).\n\nThe error message didn't really explain what I was doing wrong, and there wasn't an easy way to opt out of the `Send` bound (even `Matcher:<T>` didn't seem to be possible in all the places I needed to reference the trait and opt-out). It's possible I missed something (an easy opt-out), but the current situation is pretty brittle and the error messages don't send you down the right path.\n\nIn any event, I agree that `Send` should not be the default here.\n",
