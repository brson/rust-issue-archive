    "body": "@pcwalton Those closures are higher-ranked. \n\nFor embedded closures like that, it's critical that the lifetime elision rules apply in a nested fashion, so that\n\n``` rust\nfn filter<A>(predicate: |&A|: 'r -> bool) -> Filter<'r, A, Self>\n```\n\nbecomes\n\n``` rust\nfn filter<'r, A>(predicate: <'a>|&'a A|: 'r -> bool) -> Filter<'r, A, Self>\n```\n\nThe rule in question was about a hypothetical situation like:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo(callback: Callback) -> V\n```\n\nwhere `Callback<'a>` contains a closure `|&'a T| -> U`.\n",
