  "body": "The corrected signature of `ioctl` broke some crates on crates.io, and it's not\ncurrently worth the major version bump of libc, so for now keep the old\nsignature around for crates.io builds only with a comment to remove it at a\nfuture date.\n\nThis should allow libc on crates.io to update to the master version in-tree.\nI've verified that this was the only breakage of substance between the version\nlibc is currently built with and today's master branch.\n",
