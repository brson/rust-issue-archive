    "body": "There are plans to make the contents of `std::sys` public over time, but currently they're intentionally private while we focus on the design of other modules in the standard library. The intention is to _clearly_ have to opt-in to platform-specific behavior when you're interacting with objects such as files descriptors. This way code can clearly state that it's intended to work on unix-y platforms, but will not work on windows-based platforms. \n\nCurrently just reexporting the `AsFileDesc` trait doesn't quite lend itself to this \"opt-in\" nature and it doesn't really reflect the actual underlying implementation of each primitive. For example sockets on windows are backed by a `SOCKET`, not a file descriptor. Additionally, unix pipes on windows are backed by a `HANDLE`, not a file descriptor. Here you've added an implementation of `AsFileDesc` for unix pipes on unix, but this is a portability hazard as it will fail to compile on windows.\n\nI know @aturon has many thoughts on this, but it may be best to hold off until we have a stronger vision for the `std::sys` module and how its stabilization will play out over time.\n",
