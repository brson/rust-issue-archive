    "body": "Whoops, sorry, I meant to respond to this earlier.\nAssuming that you are using a current version of `rustc`, the easiest way to do that is to use the `rust-gdb` script. It will use the pretty printers coming with the `rustc` that is in your `PATH`. So, if you call...\n\n```\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=<your-rust-directory>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib \\\nPATH=<your-rust-directory>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/bin:$PATH \\\nrust-gdb <regular gdb args>\n```\n\n... then GDB will be started with the pretty printers located in `<your-rust-directory>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustlib`. Note though that these are copies of the 'real' pretty printer source files in `src/etc`. You might want to modify the files in `stage1/lib/rustlib` for quick testing but beware of losing those modifications when rebuilding `rustc` because that will overwrite the files in `stage1/lib/rustlib` with those in `src/etc` again.\n\nDon't hesitate to post any further questions here as they arise `:)`\n",
