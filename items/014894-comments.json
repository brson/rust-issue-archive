    "body": "Reinstantiating a struct like this seems kinda broken anyway; it theoretically needs to destroy the value in `self` when it is being overwritten (e.g. the fields haven't been cleaned up yet), and the value written to `self` is left in limbo, since it's not going to have the full destructor run.\n\nOverwriting like this is the user's choice, so I imagine the second case would rarely cause problems, but the first (especially destroying fields) seems particularly confusing.\n",
