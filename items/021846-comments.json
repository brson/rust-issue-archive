    "body": "IMO ranges should implement \"IntoIterator\" rather than being iterators themselves, it doesn't make too much sense and it's caused a few other conflicts as well as this.\n\nFor example, currently \"RangeTo\" is not iterable at all, because there's currently no such thing as a \"ReverseIterator\" trait, and it only makes sense to iterate a \"RangeTo\" in reverse. If ranges are not themselves iterators, then \"RangeTo\" can just have a method to return a reverse iterator over that range, without breaking the symmetry with \"RangeFrom\" which has a similar method as part of its implementation of \"IntoIterator\", but for a forward iterator.\n",

    "body": "@japaric There's no reason `Range` must be non-`Copy` and by making it so you make it impossible to re-use language-features in user code, because unlike other traits you can't even override `Copy` although it is obvious that `Range` is trivially copyable. You're changing `Range` to be no-`Copy` because it's an iterator, but there's more things to `Range` than just that it's an iterator, it's also a struct that has language-level sugar for construction.\n",

    "body": "> I can't use them as public fields in my structs\n\nOf course, you don't have to, you can keep the fields private.\n\n> constructors means you cna't construct a struct at compile-time\n\nYes, but you just said above that you can't make the range public, so you need a constructor. (?)\n\n> setters mean that I can't have per-field mutable borrows anymore\n\nSorry, I don't quite understand this statement, you mean a getter that freezes the struct?\n\n> There's no reason Range must be non-Copy\n\nThe original problem was #18045, which perhaps could have been prevented using a lint that triggers when an iterator is implicitly copied, but the core-devs opted for making iterators not implement `Copy`.\n\n> you make it impossible to re-use language-features in user code\n\n(I think impossible is an overstatement)\n\n> that Range is trivially copyable\n\nRange is a trivial memcpy (which is what clone does), yes, but that doesn't mean that it should be implicitly copyable. The current `Copy` trait conflates both concepts (memcpyable and implictly copyable). There was some idea floating around about splitting the trait in two: `Pod` (plain old data/memcpyable data), and `Copy` (implicitly copyable/cloneable data), but no one has written an RFC on the subject (perhaps I should before it's too late?). Splitting the traits may help in this case, but I don't know what exactly @tbu- is intending to do.\n\n@tbu- I'd still like to see what use case you have problems with.\n",

If I iterate through a range using a for loop, it's extremely counterintuitive to me that the range is modified in the process.\n\nWhile it's slightly more work to type \".iter()\" to use it as an iterator:\n1) It's not that big a deal\n2) Commonly used methods of the type \"range.iter().method()\" can always be implemented directly for \"IntoIterator\" allowing \"range.method()\" to continue to work. This comes with the added benefit that those methods will work for all iterable types, not just ranges.\n",

For example this code snippet\n\n```\nfn a(x: u32) {}\n\nfor i in (0..10) { a(i) }\n```\n\nfails with the error message \"expected `u32`, found `i32`\", so I think that this isn't a viable option. I think the best option (and the only one I can think of), is just to implement `Copy` for `Range` again, and continue to implement `Iterator`, like before.\n",
