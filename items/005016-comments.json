    "body": "This seems doable and straightforward.  It's basically adding another bit to track per variable (\"was moved\") which uses intersection on join when propagating.\n\nHowever, there is another approach that @pcwalton and I have toyed with from time to time, which is saying that when you move things, the destructor for the moved thing runs \"early\"---basically at the point where control flow on the non-moved path (if any) rejoins the control flow from the moved path.  The idea here was to remove the need to zero 100% of the time.  However, I am not sure if that idea (early destructing) is such a good idea, because it seems hard to specify and predict, whereas the current semantics (destructors run at the same time _unless_ moved) is easier.\n\nSo if we keep current semantics, then I think something like this seems like a good optimization.  In principle we could do better and identify nodes in the CFG where, upon entering the node, we know the value will be moved (this is what liveness will be computing, actually).  Then we could avoid zeroing as long as we dominate the node.  That might be trickier though given the way failure and unrolling works, so maybe it's better to only optimize the case where the variable declaration is such a node.\n",

    "body": "I don't think the alternative would necessarily be harder to specify and predict. It's basically dynamic vs. static transfer of ownership. With the current rule, a variable's destructor is run at the end of the scope it was declared in, unless ownership of it was dynamically transferred to an inner scope. With the alternative rule, referring to the variable in an inner scope _statically_ transfers ownership of it to that inner scope. The compiler already uses the latter rule to determine when a variable is legal to access, so the programmer has to think about it (if not, the compiler will make her). The alternative would make destructors follow the same rules. Currently you can have points in the code where the compiler won't let you access a variable but the variable's destructor may not have been run, which might be unintuitive itself.\n",

They'll need to be fully migrated from `~T` when they gain allocator support anyway. They can either do the memory allocation directly or use a `Uniq<T, A = Heap>` type.\n\nHere's an example of a ring buffer leaving an uninitialized gap in the underlying vector:\n\nhttps://github.com/thestinger/rust-core/blob/master/core/deque.rs\n\nThe trick is just preventing the underlying destructor from running. At the moment it leaves the vector length at zero, but if it did reuse the field for the container length then it would just call `set_len` at the end. It _could_ transmute the vector to another type, but it's easy enough to prevent it from destroying the contained values without that.\n",

It's doing comparisons along the way, and that can unwind. So instead of just doing `log2(n)` shallow copies, it ends up needing to do `3 * log(n)` shallow copies in order to perform swaps. It's a significant performance hit. The drop flag allows performing `log2(n)` shallow copies and `log2(n)` zeroes, which is still worse than when unwinding isn't present but certainly better than swaps.\n",

In particular [RFC PR 99](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/98/files#diff-08ee9639d45861edb77fa2b771d582abR116); and separately, potentially issue #14894 (depending on what solution the filer of that latter had in mind).\n\nMeanwhile, in the time since this bug was filed and the above plan-of-action decided upon, we now have a formal RFC process.\n\nSo, I am now wondering whether I or someone else should file an actual RFC for this change, since it does represent a change to the semantics of drop from what we offer today.\n\nCc: @nikomatsakis \n",

The compiler team has made some baby steps forward on dynamic drop flags, but it is not the highest priority item right now.

We have every intention of doing it. I feel silly even having to write that down, but I worry that if no one says anything, then people are going to get an incorrect impression from the comment history here.\n",

    "body": "I have some code that spends a measurable amount of time checking for drop flags (there's an inner loop which drops an `Option<Box<...>>` which is virtually always `None`), and so I'm kind of wondering if we have a ticket for the other side of this, where we delete POST_DROP_U8 and stop generating code in drop methods to check for it.  Do we have a tracking ticket for that?\n\nIncidentally, this ticket is currently the tracking issue for [the POST_DROP_U8 constant](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/mem/constant.POST_DROP_U8.html); maybe that should be repointed now that this ticket is closed?\n",
