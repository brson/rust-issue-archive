    "body": "This is more complex than I thought. If we have n objects with cleanup, we need to introduce n landing pads, because any of the dtor calls might fail. For dtor i we need to do the remaining n-i cleanups, but any dtor calls don't have to be invokes. We are basically turning any scope into n scopes - one scope per object with cleanup. In the cleanup case we don't need to do this, since this first fail will be a double fail and crash - this is the n-i case above, but with i = 0, I guess.\n\nThis seems like a lot of extra code being generated :-(. I wonder if we should treat fail in a dtor like a double fail and just crash.\n\nIf we do want to try a bit harder, perhaps an implementation strategy is to have cleanup treat dtor calls (on normal exit of a scope) as belonging to their own scopes. I guess we could do some kind of transformation of the CleanupScope data structure.\n",

    "body": "One thing I've noticed is that our existing notion of landing pads in the compiler isn't quite what you want when you execute the drop glue. Right now a landing pad will never ever rejoin the original code path (they're completely divergent), but when invoking drop glue for local variables we want both the unwinding and the normal case to fall through to the next instruction. I think that this would inflate the debuginfo metadata, but I don't think that this would incur a runtime cost.\n\nAs in, I think that each local variable's destructor should be its own basic block, and then each basic block is terminated with an `invoke` where both edges go to the next destructor (and the final basic block at the end just has a return). The runtime would continue to hard abort on double failure, of course.\n",

    "body": "I discussed this a bit on irc with @alexcrichton, @pcwalton, and @sfackler. To summarise, there are two options really - either we terminate the process if we fail in a dtor or we treat each variable as having its own scope for destructors, as outlined above by @alexcrichton and I. To expand on the latter a bit - each dtor call would invoke rather than call but the normal and landing pad branches the normal return executes the next dtor. The landing pad would set a flag and then continue with the next dtor. A double fail would be handled only by the runtime, not in the landing pads. After executing all the cleanups we would check the flag mentioned before to see if we need to resume or do a normal return.\n\nThe cost of the properly failing dtors would be a bunch more basic blocks (may or may not be a cost, depending on LLVM optimisation), a branch at the end of any function with cleanups and a stack slot for a flag on these functions, and updating that flag after a failed dtor call.\n\nThe terminate on fail method has no runtime cost and is much simpler to implement, however, failing in a dtor is common enough that it might cause problems.\n\n#8861 should prevent dtors seeing other objects in an inconsistent state, even after a failure.\n",

    "body": "> It compiles and runs fine, so it's a backwards compatibility issue. Code that leaks resources still works fine in production (just look at Firefox and Chromium) and crashing instead would be a break of the contract with user code.\n\nI think people are aware of this, but: It depends on what the resource is, right? If the resource is a mutex or equivalent then deadlocks or worse could definitely occur.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that some code in a destructor (`Drop` implementation`) might assume that if it is reached, then some previously-dropped item's destructor ran successfully--e.g. nulling a pointer. Thus, running a destructor after another destructor failed could result in all kinds of badness including potentially even UaF.\n",
