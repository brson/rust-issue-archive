    "body": "This seems like a bad idea. It's just going to be confusing. The rule implemented here is if `box (expr)` is followed by something that looks like it could be an expression, treat `(expr)` as a placement, otherwise treat it as the value to box. As you already stated, this means that `if box (foo) { ... }` considers the `{ ... }` to be the expression to be boxed. Yes that's the current behavior, but the current behavior is unambiguous: any parenthesized expression after `box` is always placement.\n\nAt the very least, `if box (foo) { ... }` absolutely must be non-greedy and treat the `{ ... }` as the block for the `if` expression. But more generally, I think it's confusing to change how we treat the `(parenthesized)` expression based on whether there's a subsequent expression.\n",
