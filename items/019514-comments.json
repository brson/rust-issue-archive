    "body": "@reem The use of overloaded operations for sets was part of the collections reform RFC. Here are my thoughts.\n\nPart of the motivation there is that there are actually several ways you may want to combine sets -- you can do so to get an iterator, you can do so to get a new set, or you can mutate a set in place. Each of these wants a specialized implementation for performance reasons, but it's a natural fit to make e.g. `union` yield an iterator while `+` and eventually `+=` create new sets/mutate in place, respectively.\n\nFurther, this use of the operators is very consistent with their normal mathematical usage, so it seems like a fairly unobjectionable use of overloading to me.\n",

First, it's probably good to remove the FIXME at the top of the file for implementing these traits as a part of this PR since you have taken care of implementing them.  Also, it _may_ be desirable to roll these commits into one to keep the Git commit history clean, though I'd wait for official word from Gankro on that one since it may not be necessary.  Luckily enough, Git makes that easy to do though :)\n\nCheers, and good work!\n",
