    "body": "> Either None < Some(_) or None > Some(_) (similarly for Result) is arbitrary. Should they really implement PartialOrd at all?\n\nI think so: it is useful for generic code (e.g. when storing things in a tree, the details of the ordering usually don't matter, as long as one exists) and `#[derive]`, e.g. one might have\n\n``` rust\n#[derive(PartialOrd)]\nstruct Foo {\n     x: T\n     y: U,\n     z: Option<V>\n}\n```\n\nThe first two fields will usually completely distinguish instances of `Foo` and the last just serves as a tie-break. As we found with `Path` and `#[derive(Show)]` previously, being forced to write out the `impl` manually in cases like this is very annoying. (FWIW, Haskell's `Maybe` and `Either` both implement `Ord`.)\n",

I think that this handle must fundamentally have an `Arc` as it's handed out to other threads for `park` and `unpark`. That being said we could also be more conservative for now!\n\nThe `Clone` is definitely wanted here, and the `Arc` is intended -- as you say, you want to be able to hand out copies of the handle to place in data structures for use with `park` and `unpark`.\n",
