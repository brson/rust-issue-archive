    "body": "I solved the issue. Previously, `./configure` had told me that I was missing _gmake_ and that I needed to install it, which I did. Then, I attempted to execute `make` which resulted in the previous errors.\n\nAfter a quick search, I found that `make` was actually calling `pmake` instead of `gmake`.\n\nMy solution is to simply execute `gmake` instead of `make`.\n\nI'm not sure if this should be documented somewhere. It's probably more of a FreeBSD-specific anomaly than anything specific to Rust -- but still; a road-block that I ran into late last night while trying to get things up and running.\n\nSource: https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/error-with-a-makefile.5279/\n",
