    "body": "Let me think about this more carefully for a sec, but it looks correct.\n\nOne caveat: this is not dynamic scoping.  Dynamic scoping would mean that the body of some called function would see values set by the caller --- but this is just saying that `self` is available as an upvar to closures within, which I think is reasonable.  In fact it's already the case, but incompletely, which is what you're fixing I guess.\n",
