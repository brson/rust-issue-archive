I'm not really convinced we need traits for `Zero` and `One` at all - are there really numeric types implementing one but not the other?\n\nI've often needed a way to construct new empty containers in generic code, and a `Default` trait might make more sense than adding `new` to `Container`. Although, generic static methods are far too painful to use so there isn't likely to be support for replacing existing `new` implementations.\n\nI definitely think it would be a lesser evil to support `TypeName::static_method_from_trait_in_scope()`, despite making `::` as magical as `.`.\n",
