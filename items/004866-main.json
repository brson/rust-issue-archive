  "body": "If an enum is isomorphic to unit, there's no need to use any bits to\nrepresent it.  The only obvious reason this wasn't the case was because\nthe enum could be C-like and have a user-specified discriminant -- but\nthat value is constant, so it doesn't need to be stored.\n\nThis change means that all newtype-like enums have the same size (and\nlayout) as their underlying type, which might be a useful property to\nhave, at least in terms of making programs' low-level behavior less\nsurprising.\n",
