    "body": "The reason for this seems to be that we mark zero-sized structs as `Ignore` in `middle::trans::cabi_x86` and thus when we create the foreign wrapper function it doesn't have as many arguments as we expected. Whereas with x86_64 we never mark any arguments as `Ignore`. I'm not sure as to whether we want to go one way or the other.\n\ncc @dotdash any opinions on this?\n",

    "body": "I just checked with clang, and it always ignores empty structs (tried i686, x86_64, mips and arm targets), though it doesn't seem to affect the generated asm whether or not the argument is present, as long as it's passed as a direct argument (only tried on i686 and x86_64). The problem we had before, which was resolved by introducing the \"Ignore\" arg kind by @klutzy was that like all structs, the empty struct was passed as an indirect argument on x86. And that messed up the ffi since it used stack space.\n\nIt's a bit sad, since it complicates things, but I guess we should be doing the same as clang here and simply ignore empty structs. Maybe it can be done a bit easier if we make it so that it's not platform specific but done for all foreign functions?\n",
