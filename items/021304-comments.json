Thanks so much for doing this @lifthrasiir!\n\nSome thoughts:\n- I want to land this ASAP :), all further thoughts are purely wishlist points\n- Making a completely separate top-level `src/test/rustdoc` directory and integrating this into `compiletest` would be a pretty awesome step forward as well. It would solve @tomjakubowski's concern of cross-crate tests (via `// aux-build`) and would also give us parallel testing, non-makefile dependencies, and filtering all by default.\n- I personally know very little about XPath, so I'd prefer to use CSS selectors, but I'll leave it up to you as to whether it's worth it (either way is totally fine by me).\n\nIf you're comfortable landing this now, I don't mind getting this in-tree ASAP to start requesting regression tests for rustdoc :)\n",

    "body": "Okay, I seriously tried that. Actually, it was not that hard to get a functional CSS parser in about 50 or 60 lines of additional code, but the resulting CSS selector will be severely limited since the partial matching of classes won't work (e.g. `.foo` will match `class=\"foo bar\"` while `[@class=\"foo\"]` won't). I gave up with the possibility of using CSS selectors, so I do not object merging it as is now.\n",
