What one cannot do (without either some relaxation of coherence rules or else `Str` being in the standard library together with an implementation of `Unsize<str>`) is use `Str<N>` in a generic context that will perform an unsize coercion (ie where an implementation of `Unsize<str>` is required), for example:\n\n```rust\nfn generic<U: ?Sized>(t: impl Unsize<U>) {\n    todo!() // something involving &t as &U\n}\n\nfn foo<const N: usize>(s: Str<N>) {\n    generic::<str>(s); // Str<N> does not implement Unsize<str>\n}\n```\n\nFor context, this is what prevents strings being \"thinnable\" in my (experimental) [thinnable](eggyal/thinnable) crate.",
