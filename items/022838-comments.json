    "body": "re coercions: `as` for implicit coercions is proposed to work in 401 and re-proposed to not work anymore (customisable lint, warn by default in 803 (type ascription). Type ascription would let you do this coercion much more painlessly (and converting concrete type to trait which should break soon, with those lints).\n\nThere's nothing in the pipeline re coercions in matches - there was some RFC recently about array patterns in matches, but I think that makes things stricter. I'm not quite sure what it means to coerce in a pattern - if it means that `match e ...` where the match arms have type `T` and we need to coerce `e` to `T` then that should be simple to change (I don't think it needs an RFC, but it probably deserves a little thought), but we don't have any immediate plans to do so. If we need to coerce per-arm, rather than just once for the whole match, that is more complex.\n",

Right now the stability pass does not consider the stability of an `impl` of a trait when it is used, it only considers the stability of the trait itself. This essentially means that a stable trait forces all implementations to be defacto stable today. I'm not sure what our prospects are of fixing this before 1.0, but in the meantime it's basically committing that for arrays of size 0-32 we're committing to provide impls of:\n- `IntoBytes` - e.g. you can construct a `CString` with them\n- `io::{Seek, Read, BufRead}` for `Cursor<[u8; N]>`\n\nI'm a little uncomfortable with the two and would prefer coercions to take over, but just want to confirm that you're on board with this information as well.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton \n\n> would prefer coercions to take over\n\nWhat coercions exactly? I remember someone (maybe @japaric or @eddyb ?) proposing \"impl lookup with coercions\" - if we are not able to find an impl of trait `Tr` for type `T` then we try to search it for types `coerce(T)` (every type `T` has finite amount of coerced types (right?), and some ordering can be introduced on them), but I don't know how realistic that proposal is and how soon it can be implemented. If it is implemented, then I guess all the impls for `&[T; N]` and `&mut [T; N]` could be dropped. Note however, that impls for `[T; N]` will stay as well as impls of `Tr<[T; N]>` for some `U`.\n",
