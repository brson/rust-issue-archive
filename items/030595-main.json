  "body": "Some history:\n\nWhile getting Rust to 1.0, it was a struggle to keep the book in a\nworking state. I had always wanted a certain kind of TOC, but couldn't\nquite get it there.\n\nAt the 11th hour, I wrote up \"Rust inside other langauges\" and \"Dining\nPhilosophers\" in an attempt to get the book in the direction I wanted to\ngo. They were fine, but not my best work. I wanted to further expand\nthis section, but it's just never going to end up happening. We're doing\nthe second draft of the book now, and these sections are basically gone\nalready.\n\nHere's the issues with these two sections, and removing them just fixes\nit all:\n\n// Philosophers\n\nThere was always controversy over which ones were chosen, and why. This\nis kind of a perpetual bikeshed, but it comes up every once in a while.\n\nThe implementation was originally supposed to show off channels, but\nnever did, due to time constraints. Months later, I still haven't\nre-written it to use them.\n\nPeople get different results and assume that means they're wrong, rather\nthan the non-determinism inherent in concurrency. Platform differences\naggrivate this, as does the exact amount of sleeping and printing.\n\n// Rust Inside Other Languages\n\nThis section is wonderful, and shows off a strength of Rust. However,\nit's not clear what qualifies a language to be in this section. And I'm\nnot sure how tracking a ton of other languages is gonna work, into the\nfuture; we can't test _anything_ in this section, so it's prone to\nbitrot.\n\nBy removing this section, and making the Guessing Game an initial\ntutorial, we will move this version of the book closer to the future\nversion, and just eliminate all of these questions.\n\nIn addition, this also solves the 'split-brained'-ness of having two\npaths, which has endlessly confused people in the past.\n\nI'm sad to see these sections go, but I think it's for the best.\n\nFixes #30471\nFixes #30163\nFixes #30162\nFixes #25488\nFixes #30345\nFixes #29590\nFixes #28713\nFixes #28915\n\nAnd probably others. This lengthy list alone is enough to show that\nthese should have been removed.\n\nRIP.\n",
