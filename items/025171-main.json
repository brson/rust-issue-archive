  "body": "It is currently broken to use syntax such as `<T as Foo>::U::static_method()` where `<T as Foo>::U` is an associated type. I was able to fix this and simplify the parser a bit at the same time.\n\nThis also fixes the corresponding issue with associated types (#22139), but that's somewhat irrelevant because #22519 is still open, so this syntax still causes an error in type checking.\n\nSimilarly, although this fix applies to associated consts, #25046 forbids associated constants from using type parameters or `Self`, while #19559 means that associated types have to always have one of those two. Therefore, I think that you can't use an associated const from an associated type anyway.\n",
