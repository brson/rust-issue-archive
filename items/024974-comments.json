    "body": "Morally I feel like something has gone quite astray if `libcore` depends on something, and I don't think there's really much benefit to using the bitflags macro to generate a implementation. We'd also be highly unlikely to stabilize a bitflags-generated interface for the flags, so either way I'd personally hold off on trying to stabilize these flags until later.\n",

    "body": "For now I'm going to close this due to the need to probably take a more comprehensive look at this API in terms of what and how the flags are exposed, and that I think we should keep the bitflags API private for now as it's somewhat of an awkward way to expose an API surface. Thanks for the PR regardless, however!\n",
