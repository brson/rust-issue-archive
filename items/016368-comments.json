User-space descheduling right before a panic seems like a recipe for badness.\n",

One might identify the places where we absolutely don't want to go through the Rust I/O stack and separate out those cases (it may be just in `util::abort`). It does seem like we want to print something on abort if at all possible though, and that should ideally do little more work than go directly to the `write` syscall to avoid scribbling on random memory and causing more badness.\n\nPerhaps @alexcrichton will chime in.\n\nTravis has been failing a lot for unrelated reasons.\n",

    "body": "The printing stack has a special case for when a local task is not available which is appropriate to use in the contexts that @brson mentioned. So long as you can _guarantee_ that there is no local task available when invoking `rterrln!` I think you'll be ok. If you ever, however, call `rterrln!` when there is a local task available, lots of badness will likely ensue.\n\nI feel like providing that guarantee (likely via `Local::try_take`) may not be worth it as this is such a small and simple function, so the issue may just want to be closed at this point (it has grown less relevant over time).\n",
