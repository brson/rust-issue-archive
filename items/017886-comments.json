There is a `panic_bounds_check`, but it calls out to `panic_fmt`, which is a \"weak lang item\", meaning that while libcore declares it, it does not define it. A `no_std` yes `core` crate which uses panics must define `panic_fmt`.\n\nAs such, I _believe_ this bug can be closed. Let me know if I've missed something!\n",
