  "body": "Add method `fn delimit(&mut self, len: usize)` to Hasher.\n- str now emits a delimiter of its own length\n- str and [u8] hash the same, and `Wtf8` does too.\n- `Hasher::delimiter` customizes how a delimiter is handled\n\nThe Hasher impl decides how to implement the delimiter. By default it\nemits the whole `usize` as data to the hashing stream.\n\nSipHash will ignore the first delimiter and hash the others as `usize`.\n\nFor the next example, take something like farmhash that is not designed\nfor streaming hashing. It could be implemented like this:\n- Every call to `Hasher::write` runs the whole hashing algorithm.\n  Previous hash is a seed to the next hash invocation.\n- Delimiters are ignored, since the length of each chunk to write is\n  already hashed in.\n\nIt follows a sketch of how siphash and farmhash could work with this change:\n\nWhen hashing `a: &[u8]`\n- SipHash: `write(a); finish();`\n- Farmhash: `hash = write(a); hash`\n\nBoth SipHash and Farmhash will hash just the bytes of the slice in\na single Hasher::write and a single Hasher::finish.\n\nWhen hashing `(a: &[u8], b: [u8])`:\n- SipHash: `write(a); write(b.len()); write(b); finish();`\n- Farmhash: `hash = write(a); hash ^= write(b); hash`\n",
