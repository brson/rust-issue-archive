    "body": "Agreed that conditional compilation needs to be at least slightly more expressive. We do have to keep in mind that cfg specs are written the general attribute grammar, so adding things like operators needs to make sense for attributes in general.\n\nI want to help you get started on this. Let's come up with something minimal that solves some real issues in the existing code base and that modifies the attribute grammar in sensible ways, and keeping in mind the issues and designs discussed in #1242. I know that @graydon and dylukes had some long discussions about ways to overhaul attributes.\n\nRegarding `=` in attributes, I think it might make sense to switch to `:` to match records. If we could make attributes have the same structure as some subset of rust types that could be really useful.\n",

    "body": "Glad this topic is reviving a bit. Dylukes and I did discuss this but didn't really finish the conversation, I'm happy to see someone else run with it too. It needs doing. What we boiled things down to was a general sense that:\n- A slightly richer set of datatypes and expression language in attributes would be useful, though I argued that outside-in evaluation (normal order) probably makes more sense for attributes, as they function more like cpp or macros than like program code. Possibly include relational operators `< <= == !=` and boolean operators `|| && !` and such.\n- A more open-ended set of \"functions\" that operate on (and return) attribute-values should probably do most of the real lifting, punting to compiler-provided extensions (as with syntax extensions etc.). The current attribute nodes like `test` and `cfg` can then operate as leaf functions that cause side effects on their attached item and return the empty attribute\n- Among new functions, some that can set variables and read them back out of the configuration dictionary would be useful, probably with variable scope following the module tree (top-down)\n\nWe didn't implement any of this, but I'd be happy to see any work along these lines.\n",
