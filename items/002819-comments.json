    "body": "Just a note: the same issue is present with Rustpkg so I won't close this, but normally rustpkg wouldn't have an issue because crates are only stored in `~/.rustpkg/lib` but there is also going to be a \"local workspace\" thing being added to rustpkg which will mean local dependencies will be built into `.rustpkg/lib` and then installed later with the project, so this error will probably be hit again.\n",
