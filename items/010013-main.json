  "body": "OS X 10.9's linker has a bug that results in it failing to preserve\nDWARF unwind information when passed the -no_compact_unwind flag.\nThis flag is passed on OS X because the unwind information for\n__morestack cannot be represented by the compact unwind format.\n\nWe can work around this problem by using a more targeted approach\nto disabling compact unwind information. The OS X linker looks for\na particular pattern in the DWARF unwind information and will not\nattempt to convert the unwind information to the compact format.\nThe pattern in question is the return address register being saved\ntwice to the same location.\n\nFixes #6849.\n",
