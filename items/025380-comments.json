The only reason I had avoided doing that was that I figured there was an advantage to keeping the metadata files for all the crates as long as they are not stale -- e.g. it will help detect conflicts earlier when `librustc` changes (and has a conflict injected with `librustc_typeck`) while `librustc_typeck` stays the same.\n\nBut that cost -- of not catching conflicts earlier -- is clearly far lower cost than rebuilding `libsyntax` all the time.\n",
