    "body": "@nick29581 Yes, that's one example.\n\nMore generally, there have been a lot of complaints about the new object safety rules not allowing you to have constructors-like methods (that produce `Self`) even though these are, in some sense, perfectly reasonable for trait objects. After all, you still construct the initial object with a concrete type before boxing it up, and after that point all actual methods may be perfectly usable with trait objects. Having to split out the constructor(s) into a separate trait seems rather unfortunate.\n\nUnlike other examples we've seen, where splitting the trait made things _more_ flexible, this seems to unequivocally make the API worse.\n\nSome real-life examples where the splitting up is having to occur:\n\nhttps://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/src/header/mod.rs#L26-L43 \nhttps://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/src/net.rs#L44-L61\n",
