    "body": "I think returning the sampling array is fine since the algorithm is more or less defined in terms of such an array. It has to exist, might as well return it. As for whether to put this on `Rng` or `Iterator`, I think it's _mostly_ a matter of where people will _look_ for such a thing. And I suspect they'll look in the `rand` module. So I'm happy enough with this as-is.\n\nThanks so much!\n",
