    "body": "@japaric stage0 looks good to me, thanks!\n\nIf you're feeling up to the task, you may be able to kill two birds with one stone by tweaking how deriving works. Right now `#[deriving]` also doesn't work on structures with a `&'a T` inside of it, but we should be able to fix that!\n\nWe could in theory expand to:\n\n``` rust\nimpl ::std::cmp::PartialEq for Foo {\n    #[inline]\n    fn eq(&self, __arg_0: &Foo) -> ::bool {\n        fn eq<Sized? T: PartialEq>(a: &T, b: &T) { a.eq(b) } // add this function\n        match *__arg_0 {\n            Foo(ref __self_1_0) =>\n            match *self {\n                Foo(ref __self_0_0) =>\n                true && eq(__self_0_0, __self_1_0), // modify function call here\n            },\n        }\n    }\n    // ne method omitted for brevity\n}\n```\n\nThat should in theory solve the problem in this PR, as well as the problem for structures with pointers!\n",

Expanding to the operator sugar works fine, it also partially fixes (the `PartialEq` part) #15689. I think the `Clone` part can be fixed using UFCS, but that can be done in another PR.\n\n> It makes me a bit sad that it would mean that we can't detect statically a fault like comparing a [T, ..3] and a [T, ..4](which I would expect to yield a type error).\n\nAhh, I didn't realize that would happen. I agree, that operation should be a type error. Perhaps, we shouldn't do the coercion, since it's just a workaround until we allow integers as generic parameters, and the impls for up to `[T, ..32]` may be enough for the time being.\n",
