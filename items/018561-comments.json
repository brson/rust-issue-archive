    "body": "Update: @huonw and I chatted a bit on IRC, and feel that the `FromIterator` direction is a good one to go in ultimately -- especially as part of the general trend toward iterators. In particular, we can advertise that one should be familiar with the `FromIterator` implementations, since there are so many goodies there.\n\nThat said, I think we can/should land this PR as-is as an incremental improvement, and do some performance testing with the iterator approach. That will also involve adding an additional adapter method like the previously-proposed `intersperse` in order to implement `connect`.\n",

    "body": "I'm a huge fan of pushing as much as possible into `FromIterator`, I've loved the ability to collect an iterator of `Result<T, Err>` into `Result<Vec<T>, Err>` many times before! Could you elaborate a little more on how you envision that for concatenation though? I'm not sure I see how it'd be easily applicable to this.\n\nI do agree with @huonw though that when concatenating items I find myself more often than not collecting an iterator into a `Vec` and then calling `concat`. Not only is it less efficient, but it's also less ergonomic b/c I have to write `.collect::<Vec<_>>()` (and often the `_` isn't enough).\n\nThis is also borderline \"one extra superfluous trait\" in the stdlib as it seems to largely just be adding methods to slices?\n\nI suppose I'd be more in favor of what @huonw suggested with `Vec::concat` and `String::connect` as I personally would find it more ergonomic as I'm usually connecting iterators anyway.\n",
