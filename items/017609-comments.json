Then the docs could reasonably go there?\n\nThis will also be a problem when we start axing the collection traits. So maybe we need to figure out a more robust solution for this.\n",

    "body": "@Gankro I think the hesitation before was mainly that it didn't make sense to land just the performance overview, without a more general overview of the API surface. (This was aside from issues about the perf stuff being too much of a tutorial on asymptotics.)\n\nAnyway, it would be really great to start work on a solid overview of the collections, both in terms of the concrete collections and their tradeoffs, and in terms of the most significant APIs/conventions. Might be good to coordinate with @steveklabnik. Is that something you'd be interested in working on?\n",
