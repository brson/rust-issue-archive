  "body": "- channel() - #[unstable]. This will likely remain forever\n- sync_channel(n: int) - #[unstable with comment]. Concerns have ben raised\n  about the usage of the term \"synchronous channel\" because that generally only\n  applies to the case where n == 0. If n > 0 then these channels are often\n  referred to as buffered channels.\n- Sender::send(), SyncSender::send(), Receiver::recv() - #[experimental]. These\n  functions directly violate the general guideline of not providing a failing\n  and non-failing variant. These functions were explicitly selected for being\n  excused from this guideline, but recent discussions have cast doubt on that\n  decision. These functions are #[experimental] for now until a decision is made\n  as they are candidates for removal.\n- Sender::send_opt(), SyncSender::send_opt(), Receiver::recv_opt() - #[unstable\n  with a comment]. If the above no-`_opt` functions are removed, these functions\n  will be renamed to the non-`_opt` variants.\n- SyncSender::try_send(), Receiver::try_recv() - #[unstable with a comment].\n  These return types of these functions to not follow general conventions. They\n  are consistent with the rest of the api, but not with the rest of the\n  libraries. Until their return types are nailed down, these functions are\n  # [unstable].\n- Receiver::iter() - #[unstable]. This will likely remain forever.\n- std::com::select - #[experimental]. The functionality is likely to remain in\n  some form forever, but it is highly unlikely to remain in its current form. It\n  is unknown how much breakage this will cause if and when the api is\n  redesigned, so the entire module and its components are all experimental.\n- DuplexStream - #[deprecated]. This type is not composable with other channels\n  in terms of selection or other expected locations. It can also not be used\n  with ChanWriter and ChanReader, for example. Due to it being only lightly\n  used, and easily replaced with two channels, this type is being deprecated and\n  slated for removal.\n- Clone for {,Sync}Sender - #[unstable]. This will likely remain forever.\n",
