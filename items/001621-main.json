  "body": "The installation procedure requires internet _anyway_, but some Unix denizens may be a little muffed at the idea a source package doesn't contain installation instructions! This is basically a slightly modified copy of the installation instructions in the tutorial.\n\nNote, the windows bit is currently commented out as a FIXME, since the installer is broken. The link to the installer should be taken out of the tutorial as well - I'll submit a request for that shortly.\n\nWhen Rust 0.2 or 1.0 or whatever comes out, this should be part of the distributed tarball. So it'll need to be added to the distribution. I can also do this.\n",
