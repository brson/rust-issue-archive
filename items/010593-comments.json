The existing Sha1 code was being used by rustpkg as, I believe, an implementation detail that could easily be updated or modified without being visible to other applications. I would imagine that if the create hashes are using Sha1, its going to be quite a bit harder to change that to something else after Rust 1.0.  I could be wrong about that, but, if I'm not, I think it would be more future proof to use something like Sha2 which is also widely available and much more secure.\n",

    "body": "@brson Whats the impact if the unique identifiers don't turn out to be unique? Accidental collisions are probably highly unlikely, but, intentional malicious collisions are already theoretically possible. According to Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) there is a theoretical attack that could find a collision at a cost of roughly $2.7 million today. That's unrealistic today for anyone but a nation state, but, its only a matter of years before that becomes more feasible. If Rust becomes as popular as it has the potential to be, how much of a pain would it be to change the hash in 5-10 years? It could be done today with an hour or less of work. Why not use Sha2?\n",

    "body": "Ok, so, I was thinking that the crate hash was actually hashing up its contents and so a collision might fool someone into using the wrong library. Anyway, as you point out, that's not the case. However, If the goal is absolute compatibility, its probably hard to do better than MD5, although MD5 is exceptionally insecure. Sha1 is almost as compatible, and almost as fast, but only somewhat more secure. I think its hard to find someone that recommends using Sha1 for a new application, regardless of how is being used. Sha256 or Sha512 is nearly as ubiquitous as MD5 or Sha1 and runs at a competitive speed (The Sha256 rust implementation that I wrote that used to be in libextra was faster than the current Sha1 implementation, IIRC) while being much more secure. You don't need to follow the sentence \"I'm using Sha256\" with an explanation of why its not a security problem like you do with MD5 or Sha1. So, Sha1 seems like it exists in an odd middle area of not really being better than MD5 or Sha256. I'm also a little concerned about moving Sha1 into the util module of rustc - even though this current use doesn't really have security implications, it feels like this is just encouraging a future use that might.\n\nI don't know how persuasive these argument have been. However, if you are not opposed, I'm happy to whip up a patch to use Sha256 instead of Sha1 since I don't know what the benefit of Sha1 is other than that it is currently in the Rust tree.\n",

    "body": "This change is causing a serious problem. Library names are now completely different. And I don't mean the hash. I mean the actual name on-disk.\n\nThe library name on disk is `lib<name>-<hash>...`. Previously, `<name>` came from the link args, so `#[link(name=\"foo\")];` produced `libfoo-<hash>...`. Now, it's apparently based off of the last path component of the `#[pkgid]`. So if my library doesn't have a `#[pkgid]`, then I'll end up with `liblib-<hash>...`. And since the hash is also based off of the `#[pkgid]`, then every single non-`#[pkgid]` library will result in the same full filename (as both the library name and the hash are identical). That's really bad.\n\nIf I go ahead and add a `#[pkgid]`, and use the recommended approach of using my github path as the pkgid, then I end up with a library that's potentially named incorrectly. For example, my [github.com/kballard/rust-lua](https://github.com/kballard/rust-lua) library wants to produce `liblua-<hash>...` but instead with the `#[pkgid]` it's now `librust-lua-<hash>...`.\n",
