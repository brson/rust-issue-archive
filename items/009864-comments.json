    "body": "Notable also is that Sphinx is not _just_ <code>:py:mod:`foo`</code>. You'd be setting the default domain to `py` (or in our case, `rust`), so it'd end up just <code>:mod:`foo`</code>, <code>:trait:`foo::Bar`</code>, etc.\n\nSphinx cross-references also have the ability to [control what is displayed](http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html#xref-syntax); following the normal Sphinx conventions:\n- <code>:trait:`foo::Bar`</code> would have the link text `foo::Bar`;\n- <code>:trait:`!foo::Bar`</code> would be `foo::Bar` but have no hyperlink;\n- <code>:trait:`~foo::Bar`</code> would be just `Bar`;\n- <code>:trait:`Baz <foo::Bar>`</code> would be `Baz` (but a link to the trait `foo::Bar`);\n\nI've said it before in relatively-private, and I'll say it again here: I believe strongly that using reStructuredText and Sphinx would be a better plan than using the Markdown systems currently in place. Partly, this is because of my very strong belief that reStructuredText is the distinctly superior language (it's actually designed with this sort of extensibility in mind, whereas Markdown is just a tangled mess, lousily specified), and partly because constraining ourselves to purely automatically generated documentation is manifestly a bad plan, yet that seems to be the direction rustdoc is heading at present (I would love to be wrong on this point\u2014tell me I am!). Writing custom documentation is very important; the [Django docs](http://docs.djangoproject.com/) (incidentally managed with Sphinx) are a very good example. (Sphinx would also provide the tools for producing the entirely automated API documentation which would, of course, still be desirable.)\n\nFor the next few weeks I don't have time, but I'm certainly interested in writing a Rust domain for Sphinx to demonstrate why it's better.\n\nreStructuredText is also good for this customisability as it makes it buttery-smooth to make more syntax extensions, e.g. you could trivially add a role to make links to GitHub issues like <code>:ghi:`9864`</code>. I'm sure we'd find a great many things where we could beneficially use reStructuredText's power.\n",
