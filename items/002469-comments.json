I would like to ensure the following though:\n- that it works on patterns\n- that it works for omitting _any_ of the integer-suffix types\n- that, as mentioned in the email above, it fails when the literal _changes sign_ between signed and unsigned interpretations.\n\nIf this is a step towards those things, it's fine by me. If it's a step that'll only need to be undone to do those things in the more-principled manner, might be better to just start as you mean to go on.\n",

    "body": "@graydon, @nikomatsakis Regarding patterns, you can do this:\n\n```\n  let x1 = 4u;\n\n    alt x1 {\n      1 to 2 { }\n      3 to 4 { log(error, \"hello\") }\n      _ { }\n    }\n```\n\nBut you can't do this:\n\n```\n  let x1 = 4u8;\n\n    alt x1 {\n      1 to 2 { }\n      3 to 4 { log(error, \"hello\") }\n      _ { }\n    }\n```\n\nYou would instead have to do\n\n```\n  let x1 = 4u8;\n\n    alt x1 {\n      1i8 to 2i8 { }\n      3i8 to 4i8 { log(error, \"hello\") }\n      _ { }\n    }\n```\n\nwhich is not all that helpful, and so on for `u16`/`i16`, et cetera.  That doesn't really do anything to solve the problem that @Jonanin describes in https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/1425#issuecomment-4981188 .\n\nIt handles all the signed int suffixes (no suffix/`i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`i64`) as though they had been the corresponding unsigned int suffix, if the corresponding unsigned int type is what the context expects.  But as far as I can tell, the only case in which this is at all helpful is in the no-suffix case.\n\nAnd, changing sign totally breaks things!  Ugh.  (And I honestly have no idea how to deal with that.) So forget this, it doesn't work.  I was squeamish about it anyway.\n",
