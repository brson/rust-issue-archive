    "body": "Finally fixed this. I thought that if you had a foo.rc file you could have a foo.rs which would automatically get compiled in and allow you to put the foo.rs items in the project namespace. When I did my renaming I changed things around to use that pattern, but that seemed to be the cause of my duplicate module error.\n\nAfter renaming rwebserve.rs to server.rs and adding `mod sever;` to my rc file I can now build again.\n",
