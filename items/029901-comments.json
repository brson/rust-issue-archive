    "body": "I'm a little confused after some investigation here. According to Windows [the name of a variable cannot contain an equal sign](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682653%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) but in practice it looks like the first character can be an equal sign but no others can be. That would explain what's going on here in MinGW because the actual variable name is `=C:` where we're interpreting it as the empty string.\n\nI think that this may want to update the parsing to account for that (e.g. allow a leading `=` sign) but otherwise I don't think that this should start ignoring malformed strings just yet as we don't have any other instances in the wild of it coming up.\n",
