    "body": "It's fundamentally impossible to do this because it would cause undefined behaviour. Using stack probes, a stack overflow can occur on any write to the stack, and it's completely undefined to unwind from an arbitrary point. It would be impossible to write memory safe low-level code and LLVM also doesn't support an exception model with arbitrary unwinding points like that. With the segmented stack preludes, they are injected during code generation which is too late to have well defined unwinding. The ability for every function to unwind would also result in the impossibility of writing correct low-level code.\n",
