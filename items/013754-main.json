  "body": "The underlying I/O objects implement a good deal of various options here and\nthere for tuning network sockets and how they perform. Most of this is a relic\nof \"whatever libuv provides\", but these options are genuinely useful.\n\nIt is unclear at this time whether these options should be well supported or\nnot, or whether they have correct names or not. For now, I believe it's better\nto expose the functionality than to not, but all new methods are added with\nan #[experimental] annotation.\n",
