The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

Above in the config file there is a check to force clang for Mac OS 10.9 and up which already checks for the apple specific llvm version, the newer version string as @alexcrichton called it, some logic for this could be put in there, or around the normal version check we could add an extra if/fi to branch for apple llvm, which would be preferable?\n\nThe former keeps the Mac OS 10.9+ specific checks in one place, the latter keeps the version checking in one place, what do you guys think?\n",
