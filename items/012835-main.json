  "body": "The rust-mode-indent-line function had a check, which ran after all the\ncalculations for how to indent had already happened, that skipped\nactually performing the indent if the line was already at the right\nindentation.\n\nBecause of that, the cursor did not jump to the indentation if the line\nwasn't changing.  This was particularly annoying if there was nothing\nbut spaces on the line and you were at the beginning of it--it looked\nlike the indent just wasn't working.\n\nThis removes the check and adds test cases to cover this.\n",
