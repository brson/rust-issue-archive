Any solid plans yet?\n\nI hope you do not mind me interjecting as the Cerberus for nomenclature. \n  When people first hear about rump kernels, they're slammed with a \nbunch of new terminology which is easy to mix up, especially since the \nterminology hasn't established itself in common lingo.  So, my \nmotivation here is to politely advance establishing that lingo.\n\nA rump kernel is built from [monolithic] kernel driver components with \nthe rest of the kernel simply not included.  Why?  1) full-blown OS \nkernels are the only places with truly working drivers 2) the \n1960's-relevant bits of said kernels are of diminishing relevance in \n2010's.  So, \"Rust rump kernel\", at least to me (and I did coin the term \n\"rump kernel\"), would imply that you have an OS kernel written in Rust \nwith some irrelevant bits that you want to leave out from your stack. \nSince you'd be writing your hypothetical OS now'ish, it would be silly \nto design it as a 1960's time-sharing OS, and therefore you wouldn't \nneed to throw those bits out.  Besides, writing real-world compatible \nset of drivers will not happen overnight no matter how good the language \nis (because the world is broken ;).  Hope that made sense.\n\nWith that out the way, the question about intersection points between \nRumprun unikernels and Rust might be interesting to discuss in a forum \nbeyond this pull req.\n",

Might be worth it, for example if rumprun ever grows the ability to host musl (currently seems very unlikely to me, but who knows) we might want to differentiate between `target_vendor` and `target_env`.\n\nI can give `target_vendor` a shot. What should `target_vendor` be set to for the existing targets? Should it be empty? Should it be \"unknown\"?\n",

    "body": "@brson \n\n> What is target_env? Is it just some random metadata that can be used to disambiguate platforms?\n\nI took this name from [LLVM's `EnvironmentType`](http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/classllvm_1_1Triple.html#a1778f5c464f88710033f7e11e84a9324) enum as it was where GNU vs MSVC was disambiguated\n\n---\n\n@gandro \n\nYeah `target_vendor` is probably the best option. You'll probably want to gate it by default for now (e.g. require `#![feature(target_vendor)]` to use it, and most of the existing triples will be `unknown` but the OSX ones at least will be `apple`\n",
