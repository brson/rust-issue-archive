    "body": "I again don't see why this should be tied to ABI. Why not just make fully public (reachable) paths in a binary external like `clang` does? An LTO pass can internalize everything but `main` without hitting the problems we do.\n\nThe rationale for adding the `building_library` check was due to reachable not working very well. Assuming it works well, the only difference between a executable and a library should be that `#[inline]` doesn't make functions get considered reachable in an executable.\n",
