    "body": "I believe that this is because the program here isn't actually using any symbols from the standard library. We do actually do a topological sort of the libs on the command line. The linker command line looks like:\n\n```\ngcc ... program.o -lstd ... -lcore\n```\n\nHowever, this program doesn't actually use any symbols from the standard library's rlib, so the linker actually discards `-lstd` after it looks at it, moving on to the next library. When it reaches `-lcore` (which has a reverse dependency back onto libstd), we've stripped libstd, so `rust_begin_unwind` is lost, and it becomes and undefined symbol.\n\nThe best way to solve this... I'm not entirely sure! I've thought in the past that each object generated by rustc needs a symbol which can be referenced by objects to guarantee the linker doesn't strip any of them, which would definitely help here but is slightly heavy-handed...\n",

This means that in the first example, there are outstanding undefined references when `-lc2` is encountered, and it resolves some of them, so we keep the lib. This then keeps `-lc3` as well.\n\nIn the second case, when the linker looks at `-lc3` the library doesn't actually satisfy any outstanding undefined references, so the linker forgets about it, includes `-lc2` and then errors with undefined references to `-lc3` which it already forgot about.\n\nThe current topo-sort is here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/351f7afd06d2164b5bfe2467333c355a20fcb02d/src/librustc/metadata/cstore.rs#L156-L184\n",
