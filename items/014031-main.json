  "body": "This adds a new libprobe with a probe! macro, for adding static\ninstrumentation to any rust crate.  Please see the docstrings for simple\nprobe examples and how they might be used by tools.\n\nThis initial version only implements SystemTap SDT, with a voided macro\nfor other platforms, so probes can be freely written anywhere.  I\nbelieve the macro is generic enough that a DTrace USDT probe! could be\nimplemented for freebsd and macos too.\n\n---\n\nThis is related to issue #6816 requesting DTrace USDT, although I only implemented SystemTap SDT.  I enabled this for both Linux and Android target_os, although I only tested the former.  Since it's simply void everywhere else, it's safe to insert probes in any code.\n\nPlease let me know if anything needs to change, and I'm also happy to answer questions about debugging with SDT.  Thanks!\n",
