    "body": "I'm not entirely certain of the fate of `rt::io::extensions`. Right now it's a small dumping ground for conversion between things, I ended up just dumping the only used `std::io` functions into it. Some more thought should probably go into the organization of the module before removing it outright.\n\nDo we want to keep the bytes iterator? Do we want to start dumping byte conversions in `rt::io`? I suppose they kinda belong there b/c all the other conversions are currently done there, but moving the iterator into the module seems a little odd.\n",
