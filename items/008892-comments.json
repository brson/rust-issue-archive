In particular: there's a question of, does building a package mean building every crate file in any subdirectory of the package directory? Or, does it mean building the crates in the top-level directory, plus all their dependencies (searching subdirectories of the package dir as well as the RUST_PATH)? If the latter, then this bug will become a non-issue, but if the former, it's still an issue.\n",

    "body": "What do you think about having the main crate files simply be put in the src directory? For example for glfw:\n\n``` c\nglfw-rs/src/lib.rs // #[crate_id = \"github.com/bjz/glfw-rs#glfw:0.1\"];\nglfw-rs/src/examples/window/main.rs // extern mod glfw;\n```\n\nExecuting `rustpkg build` or `rustpkg install` would then only install this \"main\" crate (`rustpkg build glfw` would also still work).\n\nAlso this removes the repeated name. Let's say I have a project foobar and am using rustpkg for building it. `/home/jhasse/projects/foobar/src/foobar/main.rs` repeats the name. This was pointed out by someone on IRC a couple of weeks ago as being a \"bug\" of rustpkg.\n\nThe package id would then also be an optional argument for `install` and `build`. This way editors can execute rustpkg in any project without extracting the crate name.\n",
