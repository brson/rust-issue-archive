    "body": "The build prerequisites to start running compiler tests are numerous at the moment, and I accidentally made it worse recently by making librustdoc, etc. prerequisites. I'll fix that shortly.\n\nI think we can easily make it so the target libs only need to build through std before testing. That should be better, but you'll still have to build all the way through stage0. It would be nice if `make check-stage0-rpass` worked and only required core and std to be built.\n",
