    "body": "Hm, you may be right about that. I still might be inclined to complexify the `find_libdir` method to fallback to `CFG_LIBDIR_RELATIVE` if `lib` doesn't exist in order to keep the in-tree structure consistent (assuming we did the same on windows, where we currently put some libs in `bin`).\n\nAlthough, I think I recall my preferred option for fixing this problem previously was actually to kind of do the opposite of where this patch is going (and what I'm currently suggesting): remove the `--libdir` option and the libdir rewriting from rust-installer (since it can't work without help from the buildsystem and `CFG_LIBDIR_RELATIVE`), and continue what we're doing now in the buildsystem, customizing the in-tree layout and that in the installer tarball. That would solve the case for ditros using `make install`, without implying that the main installers we distribute can usefully customize `--libdir`.\n\nCan you remind me the gentoo file system layout, why `--libdir` is customized?\n",

    "body": "Adding another fallback in `find_libdir` should work, yeah, and would be pretty easy.  (In fact it already basically exists, it would just require checking whether the `CFG_LIBDIR_RELATIVE` path was valid and ignoring it if it wasn't.)\n\nThe only downsides I see to removing the libdir rewriting in the installer are (1) rewriting `lib` to `lib64`/`lib32` as appropriate should currently work (although I wouldn't be surprised if no one used that featue) and (2) the installer would still have to figure out where to install the manifest and similar files somehow, so either these would have to move out of $libdir, $libdir would have to be encoded in the installer (or tarballs) somehow, or we'd still be relying on `configure` and `install.sh` getting the same value passed.\n\nGentoo wants to allow multiple versions of Rust to be installed simultaneously.  In theory you could have stable, beta, nightly, and git versions of rust installed simultaneously (and also binary distributions of the first three). I was not involved in deciding on the structure, so I can only report what is going on, not give reasons.\n\nThe executables are installed to, for example, `/usr/bin/rustc-1.4.0` (although the versions appear to be lies in the non-stable channels: things like `rustc-99`).  There is a system to maintain a `/usr/bin/rustc` symlink.\n\nThe `--libdir` is set to `/usr/lib{,32,64}/rust-${version}`, presumably so that the different channels don't try to install files over one another.  The libraries themselves have suffixes so they wouldn't conflict (although I'm not sure how well `rustc` handles finding multiple versions of the same library at the moment), but things like the gdb scripts don't.  (Not that the gdb scripts work currently, since `rust-gdb` hardcodes `lib/rustlib/etc` as the path to the python scripts.)\n\nThe man pages are put in `/usr/share/rust-${version}/man`, and the miscellaneous documentation is put in `/usr/share/doc/rust-${version}` (manually, since Rust's configure script doesn't have a `--docdir` option).  There's also an environment file installed to add the appropriate values to `LDPATH` and `MANPATH`.\n\nThere are also packages that don't compile from source, which appear to install to someplace in `/opt` and then symlink the binaries to `/usr/bin`.  I've never tried using those.\n",

Argh.\n\nThanks for the explanation of what Gentoo is doing.\n\nOK, I'm going to accept this as-is to get it working - it's a small change that does improve the current state. I'd like to come up with a side-by-side scheme that we can feel confident about supporting and that is workable for all distros, but right now I don't have great ideas.\n\nI'd suggest that gentoo consider setting up their custom filesystem layout differently though, in a way that doesn't tax our build / install system so much. Instead of using the `--*dir` options (which I understand are traditional and _should_ work as expected), just do a typical `--prefix` install to `/usr/lib/rust-$version`, which is guaranteed to work and not break weirdly. Then use symlinks to set up the user-facing file system as described.\n\n@bors r+\n",
