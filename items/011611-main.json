  "body": "Fixes #6593\n\nCurrently, Rust provides no way to print very large or very small floating point values which come up routinely in scientific and modeling work. The classical solution to this is to use the scientific/exponential notation, which not-coincidentally, corresponds to how floating point values are encoded in memory. Given this, there are two solutions to the problem. One is what, as far as I understand it, Python does. I.e. for floating point numbers in a certain range it does what we do today with the `'f'` formatting flag, otherwise it switches to exponential notation. The other way is to provide a set of formatting flags to explicitly choose the exponential notation, like it is done in C. I've chosen the second way as I think its important to provide that kind of control to the user.\n\nThis pull request changes the `std::num::strconv::float_to_str_common` function to optionally format floating point numbers using the exponential (scientific) notation. The base of the significant can be varied between 2 and 25, while the base of the exponent can be 2 or 10.\n\nAdditionally this adds two new formatting specifiers to `format!` and friends: `'e'` and `'E'` which switch between outputs like `1.0e5` and `1.0E5`. Mostly parroting C stdlib in this sense, although I wasn't going for an exact output match.\n",
