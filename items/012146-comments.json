As implemented, you'll get an error message that looks like:\n\n```\nextern mod extra; //~ ERROR: could not find crate for `std`\n```\n\nI agree that the span is probably pointing at the right location right now, but I think that the error message needs to be updated to fix the bug in question.\n\nAdditionally, this change should be accompanied with a `compile-fail` test that ensures that the message is printed at the right location.\n",

    "body": "Oh sorry, I'd change `extern mod crateB` to just `crateB`, but otherwise that looks good to me!\n\nAs for testing, the usual `compiletest` infrastructure may not be good enough here, but you should be able to write a `run-make` test to do the fancy things. Sadly it's not as accurate with checking where the error is emitted, but you could always grep for line numbers which would just be a little fragile if it changed (but not too bad).\n",
