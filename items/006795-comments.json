    "body": "Good news... after an update, it now provides a nice error message rather than an ICE.  It appears that rust does not currently support macros that expand into macro definitions.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n```\nRunning /Users/clements/rust/build/x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc:\n/tmp/foo.rs:4:23: 4:24 error: unknown macro variable `y`\n/tmp/foo.rs:4         macro_rules! f(($y:ident)=>\n                                     ^\n```\n\nIt appears that macro expansion insists that all identifiers preceded by a $ must be already bound to syntax terms. Fixing this will probably require a bunch of steps.\n",

    "body": "update and more detail on this: the central issue here appears to be that macro invocation bodies are \"too parsed, too soon.\" More specifically: macro invocation bodies are not parsed into ASTs, they're kept as token trees. That's good. However, the token tree language is designed to allow these token trees to contain pattern variable references. That is, pattern variables are identified when the macro is parsed into a token tree.  This is bad, because you don't yet know whether a given pattern variable is a pattern variable binding or a pattern variable use.  I believe the solution is to delay this decision until macro expansion time. \n",
