    "body": "I want to elaborate a little for future bug reviewers, because I did not understand what Niko meant by \"the lifetime of the `s` is lost\" in the description.\n\n### High-level explanation:\n\nConsider:\n\n``` rust\nlet s = ~\"input\"; return with_str_reader(s, consumer);\n```\n\nThis will invoke `consumer` with a reader object that should read the input `s`.  Presumably that reader will not copy the state of the string to its internal state, but instead will hold onto a reference to the string.  The problem is that since the signature says that reader argument is a `@Reader`, nothing is keeping the `consumer` closure from stashing a reference to that reader somewhere else that will outlive the lifetime of `s`.  (Or just returning the reader outright.)\n\nIn theory, the implementation of `with_str_reader` could copy the contents of the string in order to enable the reader to outlive the `s`; it would be silly, but the point is that the signature itself here is not fundamentally \"wrong\" in a way that the borrow-checker could detect.  Rather, the signature is wrong in the sense that it makes the obvious implementation unsound; it [over-]promises to provide a `@Reader` when it really should provide something more restricted.\n\n### Concrete example\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    fn its97<T>(f: &fn(@Reader) -> T) -> T {\n        let s = std::str::from_bytes([97]);\n        std::io::with_str_reader(s, f)\n    }\n\n    fn consumer(r: @std::io::Reader) -> int { r.read_byte() }\n    println(fmt!(\"%d\", its97(consumer)));\n\n    let long_lived_reader = its97(|r| r);\n    println(fmt!(\"%d\", consumer(long_lived_reader)));\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n% ~/Dev/Rust/Issues/iss5723-a\n97\n0\n```\n\n(We're \"lucky\" that it didn't crash, rather than returning the arbitrary value 0.)\n\nWhen this bug is fixed, the above example code should be rejected, as well as any variant that lets the reader flow to the `long_lived_reader` binding beyond the lifetime of the string created within `its97`.\n\n### The solutions\n\nNiko's suggested alternative signatures properly reflect the intended implementation.\n\nIn the first, \n\n``` rust\npub fn with_str_reader<T>(s: &str, f: &fn(&Reader) -> T) -> T {...}\n```\n\nthe reader is itself passed as a `&ref`, so its dynamic extent is bounded, and it should be impossible for the `consumer` closure to store that value somewhere else.  In the second,\n\n``` rust\npub fn str_reader<'a, T>(s: &'a str) -> &'a Reader {...}\n```\n\nthe reader is again a borrowed reference; this time the reader's lifetime explicitly tied to the lifetime of `s`, so again it will be impossible for one to retain a reference to the reader that outlives the dynamic extent of `s`.\n\n### Implementation-oriented details:\n\nI had thought, after reading the description and talking to Niko, the implementation of `with_str_reader` must be using an unsafe block to let the `@Reader` it creates hold a reference to the bytes via a `&ref` into the borrowed `s`.  But upon inspection, I see no unsafe block in the implementation:\n\n``` rust\npub fn with_bytes_reader<T>(bytes: &[u8], f: &fn(@Reader) -> T) -> T {\n    f(@BytesReader {\n        bytes: bytes,\n        pos: @mut 0\n    } as @Reader)\n}\n\npub fn with_str_reader<T>(s: &str, f: &fn(@Reader) -> T) -> T {\n    with_bytes_reader(s.as_bytes(), f)\n}\n```\n\nI plan to check with Niko about this.  My current hypothesis is that the borrow-checker _should_ be rejecting the code above, and when Niko says \"I have a fix for this in a branch\", I believe is is referring to a fix to the borrow-checker so that this code _is_ rejected.  But since `&` objects did not work at the time when he posted the bug (and may still not work), we cannot switch to the variants listed in \"The solutions\", which both use `&` objects (the `&Reader`).\n",
