It's tough because you can only set the length on an owned vector, and I would much rather have `fn read(&mut [u8])` than `fn read(&mut ~[u8])`. I think that we can live with this for now as long as we design things well, although we may want some sort of utility which wraps this unsafe behavior for us.\n",

    "body": "One option that may be a bit safer is to provide a method that returns a _zeroed_ vector instead of an uninitialized vector. I'm not sure how smart the `calloc` implementation rust is using is, but large allocations are presumably backed by anonymous pages which are automatically zero so large allocations of 0s are just as fast as large allocations of uninitialized memory. It wouldn't be safe to provide it for arbitrary `~[T]`, but adding it to `vec::bytes` and only providing it for `~[u8]` would probably solve the majority of the use cases for needing it.\n",
