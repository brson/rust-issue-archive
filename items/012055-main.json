  "body": "This PR extends the tidy formatting check to rust files in the test folder. To facilitate this, a few flags were added to tidy:\n- `xfail-tidy-cr` - Disables the check for CR characters for all following lines in the file\n- `xfail-tidy-tab` - Disables the check for tab characters for all following lines in the file\n- `xfail-tidy-linelength` - Disables the line length check for all following lines in the file\n\nChecks should not have to be disabled often. I disabled line length checks in `debug-info` tests that use `debugger:` checks, but aside from that, there were relatively few exclusions. Running tidy on all the tests does slow down the formatting check, so it may be worth investigating further optimization.\n\ncc #4534\n",
