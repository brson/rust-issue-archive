    "body": "Hi! Thanks for the bug report, but I think this is a dup of https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/8741 (and https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/7989, and a few others). It's very confusing at the moment, but the lifetime called `'self` should essentially only be used when the compiler says you can't use anything else, the \"correct\" thing to use is:\n\n``` rust\nfn char<'a>(c: u8) -> Parser<'a, u8> {\n   ...\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above still won't work (although it will give a proper error message rather than an ICE), since `&fn`'s with captures cannot be returned. `Parser<A>(~fn(&str) -> Option<(A, uint)>)` or `@fn` probably work better.\n",
