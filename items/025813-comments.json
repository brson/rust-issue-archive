The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @aturon (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

I realize many community members\n(notably @acrichto and @nmatsakis) disagree with this stance!\n\nThat said, this at very least seems pretty niche, as you might want your\n(unsafe!) code to do something a bit more useful than panic with a bad\nindex. Also if you're writing to the extra capacity then you need to check\nthe capacity anyway? Is this something you run into often with Vec?
