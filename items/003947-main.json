  "body": "This change fixes a few things in the tutorial.  Aside from the obvious minor grammatical edits:\n-   It seems odd to list `curl` as a dependency and then recommend using `wget` to grab the tarball.  Changed the command to `curl -O`.\n-   The list of basic arithmetic operations was a mix of parts of speech; they are now all imperative verbs.\n-   The tutorial has a section about the preferred terminology for the kinds of pointers, but subsequently occasionally uses the non-preferred terms \"shared box\" and \"unique box\"; these have been changed to \"managed box\" and \"owned box\".\n",
