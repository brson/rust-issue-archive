The actual condition is \"if the number of output types is more than one AND if one of the unnamed emit options is `link`\"\n\nThe emit options are stored in a hashmap in `sess.opts.output_types`. The current code just looks for hashmap entries that exist but have a `None` value. What we need to look for is an entry where the key is [`Exe`](http://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/rustc/session/config/enum.OutputType.html) and the value is `None`.\n\nSomething like `&& sess.opts.output_types.get(Exe).is_none` in that if should fix it. You will need to update the text to that from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20130#issuecomment-228900232 too.\n",
