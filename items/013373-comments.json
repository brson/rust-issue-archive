    "body": "Rustc emits the longer NOPs when given `-C target-cpu=core2` (and many others). `nopl` and `nopw` triggers an exception for unsupported CPUs anyway, thus cannot be used for generic targets. I guess it is mostly a matter of default settings (though I don't see the equivalent to `-mcpu=native` in rustc as far as I know).\n\nMy quick investigation of LLVM source code seems to suggest that the ultimate culprit is `X86AsmBackend::writeNopData` in `Target/X86/MCTargetDesc/X86AsmBackend.cpp`, which always emits `0x90` (`xchg %eax,%eax` aka `nop`) for generic CPUs even when `0x66 0x90` (`xchg %ax,%ax`) is portable and yet longer.\n",
