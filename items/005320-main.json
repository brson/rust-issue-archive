  "body": "This is the first in a series of patches I'm working on to clean up the code related to `deriving`. This patch allows\n\n```\n#[deriving_eq]\n#[deriving_iter_bytes]\n#[deriving_clone]\nstruct Foo { bar: uint }\n```\n\nto be replaced with:\n\n```\n#[deriving(Eq, IterBytes, Clone)]\nstruct Foo { bar: uint }\n```\n\nIt leaves the old attributes alone for the time being.\n\nEventually I'd like to incorporate the new closest-match-suggestion infrastructure for mistyped trait names, and also pass the sub-attributes to the deriving code, so that the following will be possible:\n\n```\n#[deriving(TotalOrd(qux, bar))]\nstruct Foo { bar: uint, baz: char, qux: int }\n```\n\nThis says to derive an `impl` in which the objects' `qux` fields are compared first, followed by `bar`, while `baz` is ignored in the comparison. If no fields are specified explicitly, all fields will be compared in the order they're defined in the `struct`. This might also be useful for `Eq`. Coming soon.\n",
