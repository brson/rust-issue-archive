    "body": "@nikomatsakis This seems like a bug to me as well. I just encountered it trying to get this code to compile: https://github.com/jroesch/molten/blob/master/src/hlist.rs#L76. \n\nThe way I see it the expansion should be as follows.\n\nGiven a HList of type: `HCons<int, HCons<int, HNil>>` a call to `take(S { pred: Z })` should result in solving an obligation for an impl of `Take<S<Z>> for HCons<int, HCons<int, HNil>>` which incurs a sub obligation to produce an instance of `Take<Z> for HCons<int, HNil>`.\n\nWhen checking this we should know `Take<_>::R` always resolve to an `HList` (in this case to `HNil`) and then `HCons<int, <T as Take<Z>>::R>` should be equivalent to `HCons<int, H0: HList>` for the representability check. So `forall T, H: HList. HCons<T, H>` can be represented as `HCons { head: T, tail: Box<H> }` which looks finite to me.\n",
