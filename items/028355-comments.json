In reality, `pnacl-llvm` needs at least two more passes to handle:\n- LLVM's auto vectorizer (PNaCl currently disables this because it will generate illegal (in the PNaCl ABI sense) vector lengths).\n- Illegal vector types (ie not 128bit width (and not [fiu]64))\n- [fiu]64 vector element types.\n\nPreviously, I just disabled the auto vectorizor and added wrappers for the [fiu]64 SIMD types in `core`, but because of the recent SIMD rfcs, it seems I'll have to write a legalization pass anyway. The main vector legalization pass is currently WIP. The second pass to expand [fiu]64 will happen after.\n\nAlso note I'd also like to allow users to disable the setjmp/longjmp EH (which isn't free) in the future (via an unstable `-C target-options=\"blah\"` argument).\n",

This looks to be one of the only points of divergence where \"if pnacl { ... } else { ... }\" is needed, and while it's good that it's contained this basically all still looks to me like portions which would be best handled in LLVM somewhere instead of rustc itself (e.g. as it does for all other existing targets). From what @DiamondLovesYou is saying, however, it sounds like the way pnacl is integrated into LLVM makes this not easy unfortunately.\n\nI continue to be worried about the lack of automation we have for this kind of functionality where \"some subset\" of intrinsics isn't defined on pnacl, but any future intrinsics we add may or may not be part of this subset and we have no way of verifying one way or another.\n",

    "body": "These patches are much easier to digest.\n\nI still don't understand why PNaCl believes it's ok not to handle intrinsic that the LLVM supports. The explanation that pnacl is static and can't do it isn't convincing - LLVM _itself_ lowers intrinsics to libm calls and PNaCl can do that too. What happens if we do pass these intrinsic calls to PNaCl? Are they on a blacklist that causes it to fail to compile? Why not just pass the inttrinsic through to libm like LLVM?\n\nIf we must do our own intrinsic lowering, then let's do it in a generic way - give target specs a mapping from intrinsics to C calls, not have a pnacl special case. Likewise the is_like_pnacl check for emitting llvm bitcode (into a .o file?) should be a generic 'output_bitcode_to_object_file' or something.\n",

This module is then optimized and such and is passed through the pnacl backend. The definitions of libm functions are all optimized away because they're not used, and then _after_ this happens the intrinsics are lowered to calls to those libm functions, resulting in the undefined symbols?\n\nIs that what's going on?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton \n\n> So if I understand things correctly, there's one giant LLVM module which contains the bitcode for libc, libm, and the application in question. This module is then optimized and such and is passed through the pnacl backend. The definitions of libm functions are all optimized away because they're not used, and then after this happens the intrinsics are lowered to calls to those libm functions, resulting in the undefined symbols?\n> \n> Is that what's going on?\n\nNo, the problem is that LLVM's math intrinsics create implicit dependencies on libm, but the linker isn't aware of this fact, and as a result omits libm (or rather, omits the objects containing no defined undefined symbols) from the resulting module. Then, post-link, when the PNaCl IR passes and optimizations are run, `llvm.*.*` don't have something that can be used in their place.\n\nNormally this isn't an issue because codegen will rewrite these to libm as needed, thus allowing the linker to know about references to them. However, PNaCl/JS use bitcode linking, which doesn't have calls to `llvm.*.*` rewritten to libm.\n\nI apologize if I'm making this confusing, as this area seems to have recurring misconceptions.\n\nThankfully, I think my first proposal isn't as bad as I had initially feared (I'm dumb): generally, the implicit libm dep should just be made explicit, because this would also be an issue for any other target if libc is statically linked for WPO (in the same way it's an issue for PNaCl). After that's fixed, creating a PNaCl IR pass to rewritten the math intrinsics won't be an issue. Once I get time, I'll send a patch to upstream LLVM.\n\n@kripken No the file was just moved to a different folder in that commit. See: https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/master/lib/Transforms/Utils/SimplifyLibCalls.cpp\n\nIt probably should be disabled, though it probably only creates issues in extreme corner cases. See this comment from `pnacl-opt.py` from the NaCl SDK:\n\n``` python\n  # We disable the LLVM simplify-libcalls pass by default, since we\n  # statically link in libc, and pnacl-opt is typically used for post-link\n  # optimizations.  Changing one library call to another can lead\n  # to undefined symbol errors since which definitions from libc are linked\n  # in is already decided.\n```\n",

Not that this PR in its current form should be accepted, merge conflicts notwithstanding. I'll try to make time this weekend to remove the intrinsic and bitcode output logics as well merge with master.\n\n@kripken FYI, I've sent in a patch for the target machine here: https://codereview.chromium.org/1395453003\n",
