    "body": "Haskell has a similar issue: writing `map` when you're mapping an IO action over a list, so that you actually want `map_` (which ignores the result). Just my opinion, but I don't think this is confusing enough to warrant extra machinery. (And what if someone defined their own impl of `NonNil` for `()`?) After you've seen the error a few times, you learn to recognize it pretty quickly, at least in my experience.\n",
