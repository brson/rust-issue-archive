  "body": "This is a large spring-cleaning commit now that the 0.12.0 release has passed removing an amount of deprecated functionality. This removes a number of deprecated crates (all still available as cargo packages in the rust-lang organization) as well as a slew of deprecated functions. All `#[crate_id]` support has also been removed.\n\nI tried to avoid anything that was recently deprecated, but I may have missed something! The major pain points of this commit is the fact that rustc/syntax have `#[allow(deprecated)]`, but I've removed that annotation so moving forward they should be cleaned up as we go.\n",
