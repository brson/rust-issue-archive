As such this is not a duplicate of #8706, one of these CJK codepoints would still be one grapheme, but their glyph occupies the room of two \"regular\" glyphs. This specific case also seems unrelated to East Asian Ambiguous characters, as all characters in the example are East Asian Wide. In general we need a decision on how and how thoroughly to deal with East Asian Width though.\n",
