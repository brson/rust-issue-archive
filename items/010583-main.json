  "body": "I added a test case which does not compile today, and required changes on\nprivacy's side of things to get right. Additionally, this moves a good bit of\nlogic which did not belong in reachability into privacy.\n\nAll of reachability should solely be responsible for determining what the\nreachable surface area of a crate is given the exported surface area (where the\nexported surface area is that which is usable by external crates).\n\nPrivacy will now correctly figure out what's exported by deeply looking\nthrough reexports. Previously if a module were reexported under another name,\nnothing in the module would actually get exported in the executable. I also\nconsolidated the phases of privacy to be clearer about what's an input to what.\nThe privacy checking pass no longer uses the notion of an \"all public\" path, and\nthe embargo visitor is no longer an input to the checking pass.\n\nCurrently the embargo visitor is built as a saturating analysis because it's\nunknown what portions of the AST are going to get re-exported.\n\nThis also cracks down on exported methods from impl blocks and trait blocks. If you implement a private trait, none of the symbols are exported, and if you have an impl for a private type none of the symbols are exported either. On the other hand, if you implement a public trait for a private type, the symbols are still exported. I'm unclear on whether this last part is correct, but librustc will fail to link unless it's in place.\n",
