    "body": "Interesting. There may be two bugs here.  The first, I would think, is that this let assignment should not be legal.  The liveness code would not ordinarily allow you to move from the inside of managed data.\n\nThe second is the dtor running twice.  This program exhibits the same behavior:\n\n```\nclass dummy { let x: int; new(x: int) { self.x = x; } drop { #error[\"Destructor %d\", self.x]; } }\n\nfn welp<T>(+a: ~T) -> T { \n    let ~x <- a;\n    x   \n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let o = ~dummy(5);\n    welp(o);\n}   \n```\n\nMy guess is that the running twice part is a dup of #2548 or at least related.  The other part is a shortcoming of liveness/borrowck... I'm not precisely sure where the check ought to be happening that prevents moving from the interior of a managed box, but it ought to happen somewhere.  Probably borrowck since it already has the code to match up patterns and so forth.\n",

    "body": "Thinking more about this, I realised you should _never_ be able to get a noncopyable out of an @-box once it's in - it's a similar problem as option::unwrap except @-boxes always \"implicitly\" have a loan out on their contents.\n\nProbably moving out of an @-box should always be illegal, and you should have to do it explicitly by `copy *a` instead. When let-ref appears, deconstructing by-ref should be legal again.\n\nIt's interesting that the destructor runs twice in your example - that one seems more analogous to option::unwrap; seems like that should be allowed.\n\nAlso interestingly, since let is by-copy currently, this also breaks (and is nonsense, when you think about it): `let @x = a`\n",

    "body": "@graydon I believe this bug was fixed.\n\nIn particular:\n1. @huonw's test now reports the expected error (albeit with a slightly different error message).\n2. This test only prints \"Hi\" once:\n\n```\nstruct dummy {\n    x: int\n}\n\nimpl Drop for dummy {\n    fn drop(&self) {\n        println(fmt!(\"Hi: %d\", self.x));\n    }\n}\n\nfn welp<T>(a: ~T) -> T {\n    let ~x = a;\n    x\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let o = ~dummy { x: 5 };\n    welp(o);\n}\n```\n1. The test in the initial comment (which looks to have been updated?) only prints the destructor once.\n\nWhich test did you run? Presumably the test in the initial comment?\n\nThere are still actions required:\n1. Delete @huonw's test, which is superceded by `compile-fail/borrowck-move-out-of-struct-with-dtor.rs`\n2. Perhaps add the example as a test? Unfortunately, the tests in run-pass for moves are given non-helpful names like `move-1` and `move-2` so it's hard to tell if a test exists for this condition or not.\n",
