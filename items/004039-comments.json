    "body": "I made some changes to the generic pipes interface. It's currently split into 4 traits:\n- `GenericChan` - Contains `send`, which always succeeds\n- `GenericSmartChan` - Contains `try_send`, that reports whether the other end is listening. This is a hard contract to fulfill, and flatpipes don't.\n- `GenericPort` - `recv` and `try_recv`. Both these require that the port be able to detect the situation where the sender dies. With timeouts, most Readers should be able to do this.\n- `Peekable` - `peek`, which asks whether `recv` will succeed w/o blocking. flatpipes don't implement.\n",
