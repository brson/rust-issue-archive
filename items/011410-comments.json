I'm working on this now.\n\n> Is there really no way for us to add tests? This is a fairly large chunk of code and it's like to regress without tests.\n\nTests can be added by linking to a dummy library which emulates the functionality of the C functions which are being used. That way no root access is required. I don't know what would be the best way to achieve this with the build system you are using. I agree there should be test cases.\n\n> Documenting the green/native impls isn't so important, but documenting libstd code is paramount.\n\nI'll add documentation for the bits of libstd that I have changed.\n\n> I'm unhappy that we have cfg(unix) on mod unix because it really is supported by windows. I would rather not have cfg in the mod and just raise an IoError that it's impossible to work on windows.\n\nThat was there when I got here! I can't test on Windows right now, I'd be happy to remove the `cfg(unix)` around raw socket support though and add in an appropriate error.\n",

Figure out how to have this as an external library rather than built-in\n\nI would tend to lean towards 2 before 1 because I would think that it would be generally useful, but it also may be difficult.\n",

There is already a lot of duplicated code between `libnative` and `librustuv`, I would argue that the crate (or something else) should be there regardless of this pull.\n\nIn order to do this in a separate library there either needs:\n- To be some way to extend the `native` and `rustuv` crates outwith the crate itself\n- Some amount of the code I've written to be pulled which another crate can build upon\n\nI agree that there is a lot of content in this pull, and there's also a lot of scope to extend it, for example:\n- Layer two support for Windows/FreeBSD/OS X (significant amounts of code each)\n- XXXPacket/XXXHeader implementations for other protocols\n\nPerhaps a subset of these things could be added to the standard library?
