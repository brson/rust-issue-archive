We'd like to know that e.g. an enum with a single pointer constructor and 5 nullary constructors can still fit into a single machine word on 64-bit architectures.\n\nIt's not possible to do this because Rust allows taking references to the values inside an `enum`. It can't use tagged pointers without breaking the language semantics.\n",
