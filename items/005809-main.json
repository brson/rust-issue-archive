  "body": "This implements #5158. Currently it takes the command line args and the crate map. Since it doesn't take a `main` function pointer, you can't actually start the runtime easily, but that seems to be a shim to allow the current `rust_start` function to call into main.\n\nHowever, you can do an end-run round the io library and do this:\n\n``` rust\nuse core::libc::{write, c_int, c_void, size_t, STDOUT_FILENO};\n\n#[start]\nfn my_start(_argc:int, _argv: **u8, _crate_map: *u8) -> int {\n    do str::as_buf(\"Hello World!\\n\") |s,len| {\n        unsafe {\n            write(STDOUT_FILENO, s as *c_void, len as size_t);\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nWhich is the most basic \"Hello World\" you can do in rust without starting up the runtime (though that has quite a lot to do with the fact that `core::io` uses `@` everywhere...)\n",
