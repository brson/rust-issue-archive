It supports only Load-Reserved/Store-Conditional, which is an alternative way of avoiding the ABA problem. See page 30 of http://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/riscv-spec-v2.0.pdf.\n\nI don't think it would be a good idea to have in the standard library an API which can only support DW-CAS but not LR/SC, or vice-versa. In the same way, having an AtomicU64 or AtomicI64 wouldn't be a good idea, since it rules out 32-bit processors without DW-CAS.\n\nEven modern 64-bit x86 systems without DW-CAS do exist; see for instance http://www.pcworld.com/article/2058683/new-windows-8-1-requirements-strand-some-users-on-windows-8.html.\n",
