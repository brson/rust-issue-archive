    "body": "I don't believe the failure to find a method is a bug, but rather the impl definitions in the PR are not quite right. In particular, the mut_slice method is defined as:\n\n```\n +    fn mut_slice(&mut self, start: uint, end: uint) -> &'self mut [T] {...}\n```\n\nbut the receiver type is `&mut [T]`. Really the `mut_slice` method should therefore just take `self`, I should think. (Once dynamically sized types lands, the current self type would be the correct one, because the impl type would be `[T]` not `&mut [T]`).\n",
