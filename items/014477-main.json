  "body": "When spawning a process, stdio file descriptors can be configured to be ignored,\nwhich basically means that they'll be closed. Currently this is done by\nliterally closing the file descriptors in the child, but this can have adverse\nside effects if the child process then opens a new file descriptor, assigning it\nto a stdio number.\n\nTo work around the problems of the child, this commit alters the process\nspawning code to map stdio fds to /dev/null on unix (and a similar equivalent on\nwindows) when they are specified as being ignored. This should allow spawned\nprograms to have more expected behavior when opening new files.\n\nCloses #14456\n",
