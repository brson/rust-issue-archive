    "body": "I'm probably missing something here, but how would the `Text` trait actually be used? If we implement it in `extra::encoding::Base64`, `extra::encoding::Hex`, etc, I would think that it would cause a duplicate trait implementation error, and even if it didn't, how would the user select the encoding they want? You could differentiate with a dummy type parameter, but I'm not sure why `str.encode::<Base64Tag>(...)` is any better than `str.to_base64(...)`.\n",

    "body": "That is a good point yeah, I suppose it would look something like:\n\n``` rust\n// src/libextra/encoding/base64.rs\nstruct Base64;\nimpl encoding::Text for Base64 { ... }\n\n// src/libextra/encoding/hex.rs\nstruct Hex;\nimpl encoding::Text for Hex { ... }\n\n// src/libextra/encoding/mod.rs\n\nimpl SomeHelperTrait for &'self str {\n  fn decode<E: Text>(self) -> ~[u8] {\n    Text::decode(self)\n  }\n}\n\nimpl SomeHelperTrait for &'self [u8] {\n  fn encode<E: Text>(self) -> ~str {\n    Text::encode(self)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlbeit that is a bit roundabout, and to use those methods you'd have to both use `encoding::Base64` _and_ `encoding::SomeHelperTrait`. Perhaps this is a situation where a trait defining things just adds a burden to everyone using it instead of making things easier. When actually thinking it through and seeing the overhead, I think I'd be in favor of just some `to_base64`/`to_hex` methods (as is the current situation).\n\nRegardless though I think the reorganization would be nice (into an `encoding` super-module)\n",

    "body": "Looking in `src/libextra/extra.rs`, there's a couple of other super-modules we could create: `concurrency`, `collections` and `crypto`, though `crypto` is already in it's own module but reexported in the base `extra` module.\n\nI think there will need to be some changes made to rustdoc before this is a viable proposal. Submodules are currently only shown at the bottom of the table of contents of their super model (e.g. `str::raw`). For searchability's sake, I think we'd want a heirarchical display more like Go's package documentation. Rustdoc-ng may fix this already, though.\n",

    "body": "I doubt whether we should unify \"bytes to strings and back\" ones and \"generic serialization format\" ones into one modules, say `extra::encoding`.\n\n(Summary: Base64 handles octets but JSON does numbers, strings, arrays, etc.)\n\nOn the one hand, both share the same essential concept and use case: transforming data and they are used for e.g. saving data in a file, sending data through the Internet, etc.\nIn fact, ASN.1 defines its serialization formats as _encoding rules._ (a half of ASN.1 defines an abstract syntax of various data and the other defines how we represent data using bits. I refer the latter parts here.)\n\nOn the other hand, \"bytes to strings and back\" ones assume that there is already a representation of data and transform it but \"generic serialization format\" ones handle objects in the environment where a program is running: of course they may be represented as sequences of bytes (or words) in the real world but in theory they are _abstract objects._\nWe don't care how a JavaScript engine represents `[1, 2, 3]` when we serialize it into JSON. We do care whether a JavaScript engine receives `89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a` when we encode it using Base64 and send it to a browser.\n",
