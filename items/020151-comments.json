    "body": "`Drop` is already a lang item. Calling `Drop::drop` explicitly is disallowed (for safety reasons), so it\u2019s already special. We might want to change the behaviour of using `Drop` as a bound in the future, so disallowing it for now would make that a backwards-compatible change. `Drop` as a bound is basically useless because it doesn\u2019t mean that the type has no destructor, it just means that it doesn\u2019t explicitly implement `Drop` (e.g., `struct Foo(TypeThatImplsDrop);` does not impl `Drop`, but still uses `TypeThatImplsDrop`\u2019s `Drop` impl as part of its destructor). `Drop` is barely a normal trait at all. It has a method, but that method can\u2019t ever be called explicitly. I think that `Drop` being a trait is merely a convenience that stops us from having to add a special way of adding destructors to things. It certainly should never be used as a bound.\n",
