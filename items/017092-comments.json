    "body": "@huonw: It's just an issue for non-standard alignment, since jemalloc needs to do a branch to support it. For a `--disable-jemalloc` build, a non-standard alignment is a bigger problem. It's just a small micro-optimization, but I happen to be looking into micro-optimizing allocation right now so every little thing counts. In theory, Rust could also do the size calculation statically and have a non-standard hole in the jemalloc API... but we can get to that kind of thing later.\n",
