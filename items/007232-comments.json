    "body": "I've started playing around with this. I have a very early implementation here: https://github.com/dbp/rust-quickcheck\n\nI opted _not_ to use the Rand trait for random values, but rather to introduce a different trait, Arbitrary. The reason for this is that I'm not sure if a uniform distribution is actually what is going to be the most useful for testing. For example, when testing vectors, I'd want to bias the empty one relatively high, because I think that's an edge case that is often forgotten. I'm not sure if changing the distribution is the right way to aim for common edge cases, but in case it is... not tying this to Rand seems useful.\n\nThe other main trait is Testable - which is a way to mimic lisp apply-like behavior for functions of different arity (this seems to be the approach in the Haskell library - though with a lot more layers of abstraction!) \n\nThoughts welcome!\n",

    "body": "@jakub I'd argue that Rust is redefining the baseline for many important aspects of software development and that testing should be one of those aspects.  Property-based testing is in my experience (Erlang/QuickCheck+PULSE/Basho) a huge step forward (like lifetimes or other innovations in Rust) from unit-tests and tends to create more stable and well thought code.  Including a mature quickcheck-like property-based testing framework would make a difference in the overall quality of software on this platform and that quality would translate to confidence and hopefully greater adoption.\n\nUnit testing (or more generally, software tools) are hard to monetize (ask QuviQ) and generally require a business model that isn't inclusive and open and so the net result is that the community suffers until they re-invent the techniques (Proper, Triq, etc) in open source.  This is really a stagnation of a good idea, not a full adoption.  I'd argue that this is another good reason for Mozilla to invest in this feature of Rust.\n\nOf course, the counter argument is \"where do we draw the line, we can't be responsible for pushing _all_ the limits.\" and I fully appreciate that, but...\n\nI thought I'd provide some food for thought.\n",

This is possible because with Cargo and the future crate registry in place using an external crate will be a very easy thing to do and so there is no need at this point to pick winners even for important functionality like URL handling, M:N threading or, indeed, advanced property testing.\n\nMy understanding is that this could be revisited in the future.\n",

    "body": "@gburd @jakub- For what it's worth, I think property based testing and unit testing are _different_ approaches to testing. I see neither one as superior. I frequently use both.\n\nWith that said, QuickCheck was once considered for inclusion in the standard Rust distribution, but it was rejected. My understanding of why was that it hadn't generated enough evidence that it would be widely used. (I agree with their assessment.)\n\nMoreover, I generally agree with the direction of \"make the standard distribution more lean.\" Using QuickCheck is dead simple now that we have Cargo.\n",

    "body": "@jakub I fully understand and appreciate the trade-offs and balancing act you and the Rust Team must be facing and I think that you're doing an amazing job.  Thank you all.  I had to advocate for property based testing because I think it has the potential to have a transformative impact on programming.  Cargo is a great tool and a good system to sponsor and encourage community contributions to the Rust ecosystem and I can see how QuickCheck-like tools could flourish within that framework.\n\nI'm likely going to bet heavily on Rust in my future projects and I'm 100% sure I'll be incorporating software written in Rust developed by someone else in those projects.  It's also very likely that I'll be building on top of other systems which use Rust in many other ways.  It would be easier to bet on those dependencies (read: sleep comfortably through the night) were I to know that everyone had tuned into this new form of testing.  Value judgments aside, doing the work to property test in addition to unit test would (IMO) dramatically improve software quality across the board. Unfortunately that's not going to happen unless a) the software is readily available to support it and b) the leaders in the space (you and the Rust Team and those first vocal/influential adopters in the Rust community) are moving in that direction as well.\n\nThe Rust Team has been breaking a lot of new ground and I can't thank you all enough for that hard work.  Keep pushing, keep questioning and keep redefining the state of the art.  I appreciate your thoughtful responses.\n",
