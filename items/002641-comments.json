    "body": "Can you try GCC 4.7.1? I have GCC 4.7.1 and I don't get this error. It might also be [64-bit only that fails](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=791365).\n\nApparently a quick way to fix it is `-fno-tree-pre` (see [here](http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=11926#c14)) when compiling clang. I don't know why it hasn't been fixed though, seeing as it looks like these bugs were fixed in 3.1 which is apparently the version of Rust's LLVM fork.\n\nEDIT: I got this error when compiling with GCC 4.7.1 on an x86_64 system, too.\n",
