  "body": "This adds support for constness to fn pointer types, e.g. `x: const fn(i32) -> i32`. \n\nMost of the implementation is just copying how unsafety works currently, except coercion which is in the other direction (const => non const instead of safe => unsafe).\n\nSome comments/questions:\n- Coercion only seems to work by first going through a const fn pointer, e.g.\n  `const fn foo() {} let a: const fn() = foo; let b: fn() = a;` This is the same for unsafety coercion at the moment though (as @eddyb pointed out on IRC), so not sure if it's intentional. [Playpen](http://is.gd/oeLPiZ).\n- The `Fn` family of traits are not implemented for `const fn` types, how would I add this?\n- In some places where `BareFnTy` is constructed directly, I wasn't sure if they should be const or notconst (e.g. intrinsics). I think at least `mk_ctor_fn` should be const, but that breaks things until the `Fn` trait support is added.\n\nTechnically a breaking change because you can no longer do `const fn main` (should be simple to allow that if it actually makes sense to do so).\n\nr? @nikomatsakis \n",
