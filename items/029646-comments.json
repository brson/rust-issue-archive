    "body": "Is there any ETA on the stabilization of this feature? It would be really useful for something which I'm currently experimenting with, namely the implementation of Windows COM interop: One could add a trait that exposes each interface's GUID and/or class ID as constants, then e.g. [this API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/br224648%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) could be mapped to Rust in a way that takes the to-be-activated class as a type parameter that implements said trait.\n\nOf course I can work on this using nightly, but it would be nice to have some information whether the feature is going to be stabilized in the near future!\n",

Setting aside docs, I don't know why const fn is a necessary precursor to associated consts. It seems to me that associated consts could instead be the beachhead which const fn will someday make more useful.\r\n\r\nI also suspect the issue is incomplete; in the past there were many bugs with this feature. When I've used it more recently its seemed better, but I see some open bugs linked from here.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to have this on stable not because I *necessarily* care about compile time computation, but also because I have a lot of these `fn whatever() -> &'static str;` methods that feel more correct & ergonomic as `const WHATEVER: &'static str;`.\r\n\r\nI don't think there are any design issues with this feature left, and I think we are certain that we want it in the language. I wonder how close it is to a point where we could stabilize *something*.",

    "body": "@eddyb That's great to hear. I triaged the open issues linked from this thread & I agree that we could stabilize this feature in the short term. Maybe someone else has reason not to, but there's an easy way to hear from them...\r\n\r\n@rfcbot fcp merge\r\n\r\n@rust-lang/lang I propose we stabilize associated consts. :tada:\r\n\r\nOn their own they're not that *useful* (because they're primarily *useful* as the input to constexprs, of which array lengths are the only stable example), but they have a more \"para-semantic\" use as a more precise way to express oneself.\r\n\r\nThat is, today I might write:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Whatever {\r\n    fn name() -> &'static str;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut what I really want to write is:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Whatever {\r\n    const NAME: &'static str;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is both more ergonomic & it more clearly expresses *user intent* than the associated function form.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two outstanding shortcomings tracked:\r\n\r\n* __Type params in const expressions:__ ( #34344 / #39211 ) A const expression (such as an array length) cannot today depend on an abstract type parameter. That is `for<T: Trait> [_; T::CONST]` is not usable; it returns a clean error. However, `[_; i32::CONST]` _does_ work. In my opinion, stabilization need not be blocked by this. **Proposal: No work needed.**\r\n\r\n* __Associated consts and object safety:__ ( #26847) Today, associated consts are considered object safe, but if you attempt to access the associated const of a trait object type (as in `<Trait as Trait>::CONST`) you get an ICE. I think the most conservative thing to do is to make associated consts (like associated functions) non-object safe. **Proposal: make associated consts not object safe; block stabilization on this.**",

I've always ended up turning it off because it wasn't worth blocking stable on.\r\n\r\nMy anecdotal experience is that in 2015, when I tried these were just totally unusable (like I think even in runtime expressions you couldn't do `T::CONST`). When I tried again in 2016, I found that they work as you'd expect in a runtime context. The only thing that's been implemented recently is that concrete associated consts (`i32::CONST`) can now be used in constexpr context.\r\n\r\nSo yea for about a year now my experience with this feature has been that it works, but its not been worth moving off stable for.\r\n\r\nRocket apparently uses this feature, maybe someone involved in that project can give feedback on whether there have been any issues.",

    "body": "> Primarily, I am concerned that the existing impl is \"ad hoc\" in various ways and that we may discover surprising things that it allows or disallows.\r\n\r\nYes, and I've run into these since turning it on, though they've all been things where the current implementation is too conservative.\r\n\r\nFor example, this works, but requires a `'static` bound that's definitely unnecessary:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Foo {\r\n    const FOO: u32;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait Bar {\r\n    const BAR: u32;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<T: Foo + 'static> Bar for T {\r\n    const BAR: u32 = T::FOO;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work, even though it should:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// This trait works:\r\ntrait Foo {\r\n    const FOO: Option<String>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait Bar {\r\n    const BAR: Option<String>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This impl doesn't work, conservatively assumes T::FOO may have a destructor\r\nimpl<T: Foo + 'static> Bar for T {\r\n    const BAR: Option<String> = T::FOO;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, where this does work its strictly more expressive than you might expect from the errors you get for `[T; T::LEN]`, even if its strictly less expressive than it ought to be. It seems jagged and surprising but ultimately implementation bugs & I think that it doesn't have to block stabilization but YMMV.",

    "body": "There's an abstract question here: how can implementation issues block stabilization? (several other features we're pretty comfortable with the design of have similar issues - impl trait and specialization come to mind).\r\n\r\nHere are the kinds of implementation issues that can crop up:\r\n\r\n* Is the implementation *unsound*? Does it allow unsafety in safe code?\r\n* Is the implementation *overly liberal*? Does it allow safe things we don't want it to allow?\r\n* Is the implementation *overly conservative*? Does it disallow things we think should be allowed?\r\n\r\nThese seem like progressively less serious as you go down the list. Another axis each wrongness in the implementation needs to be considered on is its egregiousness.\r\n\r\nFor example, I think we should block stabilizing this the fact that consts are considered object safe today. This is both too liberal and very egregious.\r\n\r\nBut that we don't accept some uses of associated consts in other associated consts is both too conservative (not as big an issue) and not particularly egregious, and I'm comfortable not blocking on that.",
