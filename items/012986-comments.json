    "body": "I did some searching and could not find any precedence for this. The tools that convert from underscore to camel case either removes numbers or merges them together, which means there is no conventions to write multiple numbers in this style. It is easier to add those exceptions later than removing them.\n\nI talked to somebody on the rust-internals IRC channel. One was ok with it (if precedence) and one was against. Nobody was strongly in favor of it, neither am I.\n\nClosing.\n",
