For example [`time::duration`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15934) is not being added to libcore when it certainly could.\n\nIn general I feel that `libcore` should serve as being the core library for almost all rust programs in existence, including the functionality they _all_ need. I'm not totally convinced that `ascii` falls into that category, and I agree with @brson that this module is likely in need of some love to see some improvements.\n\nThat being said, the public API is entirely the same, so with the facade we're entirely at liberty to make any decision at any time and revert it at any time in the future!\n",

Unicode character processing doesn't make so much sense to put in libcore, but I feel like ASCII is common enough and self-contained enough to be a good fit.\n",

    "body": "I am somewhat torn about this. I think we should probably work on some explicit criteria for what goes in libcore. At the moment, the contents fall into roughly the following categories:\n- Primitive types and some basic operations on them.\n- Intrinsics.\n- Traits for operators and other special traits.\n- A small assortment of types/traits that all Rust code should agree on: iterators, collection traits, comparisons, Option/Result, core atomic types\n\nThere are a few other things, like `finally`, that don't really fall into these categories and could perhaps be moved out.\n\nPersonally, I don't buy the argument that because `str` lives in core, `ascii` should too. The `str` type is a primitive type, with special syntactic support. And even so, a lot of its supporting infrastructure lives elsewhere, notably libunicode. You could make a similar argument about `c_str`, and other notions of string.\n\nGiven that `ascii` is not really a primitive/core feature, the question to me is whether it's crucial for all Rust code to agree on a single notion of ASCII character. I think the answer is \"no\", when compared to things like `Option` or `Iterator` that show up in a much larger proportion of Rust code and APIs.\n\nSo I guess in the end, I'd rather not make this promotion. I'm happy to have this functionality live only in libstd.\n",

    "body": "@aturon ASCII is a rather fundamental way of working with strings. It seems unfortunate to require `liballoc` and all the rest of `libstd` just to be able to work with ASCII characters. Surely embedded systems or kernels have a need to do work with ASCII occasionally.\n\nHowever, I am sympathetic to the idea that `libcore` should be restricted in what it contains. On that topic, I have two questions:\n1. Do you think `libcore` currently contains modules that it shouldn't?\n2. Do you think there are other modules that may be wanted by embedded systems/kernels and don't depend on `liballoc`, but aren't suitable for `libcore`?\n\nIf the answer to either of those questions is \"yes\", then perhaps we should have a `libcoreextra` (or `libcoreutil` or some other name) that contains things that could technically go into `libcore` but are maybe not considered fundamental and universal enough to be put there.\n\nOtherwise, if `ascii` is the only module that fits the bill, I'd say just put it in `libcore` and call it a day. We don't need a `libascii`, and putting it in `libunicode` doesn't make sense (programs should not be required to embed unicode tables just to work with ASCII).\n",
