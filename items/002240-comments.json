    "body": "That's a tough question, and I basically think that it needs to be entirely eliminated now. This module is a combination of introspection and intrinsics and runtime representations.\n\nI think we could start by moving the entire thing to a submodule of `core::private`, which is turning into the module for private runtime details. Some of these things should not be used so can just languish there for awhile.\n\nHere's a suggestion for each thing defined in sys:\n- FreeGlue - leave in private. This is a very low level runtime detail that should not be exposed.\n- TypeDesc - leave in private. This is obsoleted by the alternate definition in intrinsics.rs\n- get_type_desc - leave in private.\n- Closure - leave in private. Again a detail of representation that should not be a public API\n- shape_\\* - delete. These look obsolete to me - I don't see how they are different than doing the comparison directly\n- size and align functions. This is a hard call. I'm tempted to create `core::size` for them.\n- refcount - leave in private. Nobody should use this.\n- begin_unwind\\* - leave in private.\n\nOK, that's everything. I guess my conclusion here is that most of this stuff just shouldn't be exposed, the size functions being the only exceptions.\n\nI think we need others to weigh in. @graydon What do you think?\n",

There's clearly redundancy between `private`, `rt` and `sys` (and probably `cleanup`, `stackwalk`, maybe some others). Don't mind the general thrust of the bug here, in terms of cleaning them up. Won't complain if some of these move around or merge.\n",
