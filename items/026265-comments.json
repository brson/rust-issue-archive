I looked around and didn't really find a definitive answer on why we'd want to favor these over `malloc`, and having to deal with alignment ourselves is always a pain.\n\nAlso, could you elaborate a little more on why we want to eliminate the dependency on the CRT? It sounds like issues like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26258 mean that it'd be nice to not have to deal with it altogether, but I just want to make sure we've got a good picture of what's going on here.\n",

    "body": "`malloc` and friends do simply call `HeapAlloc`. `_aligned_malloc` does the exact same trick as I do here with overallocating and embedding a pointer to the original directly before the aligned address. The CRT versions do handle errors through `_errno` though, and having it in Rust also means the function can be inlined to give a slight performance advantage.\n\nI want to eliminate the dependency on the CRT so that Rust can be independent of it. Such a Rust library could be used anywhere without concerns over the ABI of the C runtime. A binary built without the CRT and having its own entry point wouldn't depend on the CRT redistributables and would have a quicker startup time.\n",
