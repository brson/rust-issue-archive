You can deadlock with pipes too, with just two lines of code.\n\nThe non-`Freeze` accessors for `MutexArc` are unsafe for a totally different reason, which is documented in https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libextra/arc.rs#L201 .\n\nRegarding \"cheap and easy to catch\" - I don't believe we should try to fail in the single-task deadlock case unless we can reliably fail in all deadlock cases (which is not out of the question but requires scheduler support, see #7889). A user who is used to seeing a failure message from their previous attempts which had deadlocked would be all the more confused when they find their cross-task deadlocking code does not fail.\n",
