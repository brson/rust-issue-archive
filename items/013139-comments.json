    "body": "The way I had planned to solve this is to use distinct types for \"types that may contain inference values\" and \"types that do not\". I actually had a branch of rustc a couple of years back building that did precisely this. The basic idea is to parameter `ty::sty` with a type parameter that is the type for \"reference to another type\". Then we pull out all the inference types into a distinct enum that wraps the base enum:\n\n```\nenum sty<T> { ty_tup(~[T]), ... } \nstruct normal_type { ... sty<normal_type> ... }\nstruct inference_type { ... sty<inference_type> ... }\n```\n\nThis way, the types of an ast item are distinct from those used during inference. You can write folders and so on generically over T (in fact, lacking default methods, this was INCREDIBLY PAINFUL which is part of the reason I never tried to land the branch, but it should be easier now).\n\nYou can see some of the groundwork from this branch still:\n- function contexts have their own distinct tables for types\n- the core folder is written as a trait with default methods\n\nBut one of the challenges I remember was having to find the right canonicalization scheme. I just didn't canonicalize during inference but instead allocated fresh `@ty` everywhere. This was slow. I suspect using an arena per function would be the right answer here.\n",
