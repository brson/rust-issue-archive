(All of the entries that say \"should align\" should align with each other, and the four lines near the end that say \"compare _\" for _ in {A,B,C,D} should line up with each other.)\n\nBefore applying this change set:\n-- the \"(should align)\"'s are all over the place, and the form/line feeding spaces are not cut out as one might or might not expect.\n-- compare B and D do not match A and C.\n\n(To be honest, its hard to really say what the _right_ behavior is here, and people who are expecting a particular behavior out of a pretty printer in these cases may well get burned.)\n",
