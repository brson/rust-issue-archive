We used to because there was no synchronization of the test result output which meant that colored output would break everything. That's no longer the case, so we should be able to color output no matter what.\n\nFor the flag, it'd probably make the most sense to mirror rustc's: \n\n```\n    --color auto|always|never\n                        Configure coloring of output: auto = colorize, if\n                        output goes to a tty (default); always = always\n                        colorize output; never = never colorize output\n```\n",
