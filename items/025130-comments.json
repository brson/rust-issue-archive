You just don't see it very often because manually-installed 3rd-party software doesn't usually install dylibs into `/usr/local` (any dylibs it wants to use are usually expected to be provided by the user).\n",

    "body": "> This is Homebrew's problem. \n\nRight. I understand this is technically not an issue with Rust. I would guess that the majority of Rust users on Macs have Homebrew installed, so preventing `brew doctor` from complaining about the Rust files could prevent a lot of confusion in the future. I'm not familiar with Homebrew nor the Rust build system, but I opened this hoping to hear from someone who is familiar with both how trivial this would be to address.\n",
