  "body": "Deprecates the `find_or_*` family of \"internal mutation\" methods on `HashMap` in\nfavour of the \"external mutation\" Entry API as part of RFC 60. Part of #17320,\nbut this still needs to be done on the rest of the maps. However they don't have\nany internal mutation methods defined, so they can be done without deprecating\nor breaking anything. Work on `BTree` is part of the complete rewrite in #17334.\n\nThe implemented API deviates from the API described in the RFC in two key places:\n- `VacantEntry.set` yields a mutable reference to the inserted element to avoid code\n  duplication where complex logic needs to be done _regardless_ of whether the entry\n  was vacant or not.\n- `OccupiedEntry.into_mut` was added so that it is possible to return a reference\n  into the map beyond the lifetime of the Entry itself, providing functional parity\n  to `VacantEntry.set`.\n\nThis allows the full find_or_insert functionality to be implemented using this API.\nA PR will be submitted to the RFC to amend this.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
