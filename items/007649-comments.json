    "body": "I think the current situation needs some work, even if it only affects rustdoc output. We have some very common traits like `Writer` and `Iterator` that have a couple of required methods and a _huge_ number of default methods _one_ of which should sometimes be overridden (e.g. `Writer::flush` and `Iterator::size_hint`). The fact that those methods, as opposed to any others are supposed to be overridden is exceptionally undiscoverable from looking at the rustdoc for the traits, IMO.\n\nI think there's probably cases where it would be appropriate to override things like `read_be_i32` or `flat_map` so I wouldn't want to forbid overriding, but some annotation that would cause rustdoc to split the definitions into `Default Methods` and `Extension Methods` (or something) would help.\n",
