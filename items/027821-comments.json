Notably:\n\n```\ncommand timed out: 1800 seconds without output running ['gmake'], attempting to kill\nprocess killed by signal 13\nprogram finished with exit code -1\n```\n\nPerhaps it was swapping when compiling librustc? I've noticed it's lagged behind quite a bit on auto builds. If it was running both an auto build and a snap build it may have failed (we may just want to throttle the number of builds on the bot)\n",
