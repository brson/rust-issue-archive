  "body": "r? @nikomatsakis The typechecker previously passed around a boolean return flag to\nindicate whether it saw something with type _|_ (that is, something\nit knows at compile-time will definitely diverge) and also had some\nmanual checks for the `ty_err` pseudo-type that represents a previous\ntype error. This was because the typing rules implemented by the\ntypechecker didn't properly propagate _|_ and ty_err. I fixed it.\n\nThis also required changing expected error messages in a few tests,\nas now we're printing out fewer derived errors -- in fact, at this\npoint we should print out no derived errors, so report any that\nyou see (ones that include \"[type error]\") as bugs.\n",
