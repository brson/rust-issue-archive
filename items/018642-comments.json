As a function, `errno()` does seem to be principally used for detected errors in C functions (naturally) meaning the libraries are sprinkled with snippets such as `if os::errno() != libc::ERROR_IO_PENDING as uint` etc.\n\nFor myself, I'm just interested in having `set_errno()` defined somewhere!\n",
