  "body": "The previous code erroneously assumed that 'steals > cnt' was always true, but\nthat was a false assumption. The code was altered to decrement steals to a\nminimum of 0 instead of taking all of cnt into account.\n\nI didn't include the exact test from #12295 because it could run for quite\nawhile, and instead set the threshold for MAX_STEALS to much lower during\ntesting. I found that this triggered the old bug quite frequently when running\nwithout this fix.\n\nCloses #12295\n",
