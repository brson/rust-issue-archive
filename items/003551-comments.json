    "body": "It is probably not very difficult to switch the landing pads to use the function return value. Initiating unwinding could be done with a tiny intrinsic.\n\nSince we would be returning through `__morestack` normally the `reset_stack_limit` upcall would no longer be needed, reducing bloat. This will make stack management code in `task_start_wrapper` simpler for similar reasons.\n\nThe trickiest part may be handling an out-of-stack failure but fortunately we seem to be doing it wrong now anyway (#3555). `__morestack` can be changed to check the return value of `upcall_new_stack` for null and return early, but it will leak the arguments.\n",
