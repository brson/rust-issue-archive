    "body": "See also how cmake handles this. IMO autotools' method is hacky, slow, and ill-fit for a new tool. We don't need to probe for endianness and such either (rustc already knows that because it knows what architecture it is targetting). A lot of the things autotools checks for have been standardized and are consistent across platforms (it checks for all the standard C headers and unix tools, for example, and the existence of lots of standard functions). I think cmake's solution is a lot better, but it's not without its own set of perils (you need to actually write out configs for each library and so on).\n\nLatching on to pkg-config would be good too.\n",
