Rust needs about 2G to build. \n",

This time I've tried to build the latest code from git.\nI guess you were right about the root cause, it died with the following:\ncompile_and_link: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/librustc.so\nrust: task failed at 'failure in fork: Cannot allocate memory', /home/laci/rust/latest/rust/src/libcore/run.rs:382\n\nI also watched the memory usage with the system monitor and it never reached 80% (it peaked around 78%).
