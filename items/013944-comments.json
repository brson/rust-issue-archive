    "body": "That seems too ad-hoc. `Path` is the only standard-library-provided type I know of that has a `.display` method, and it's fairly unique in that paths are often represented as strings by people (who don't know any better), an so being able to `Show` a `Path` makes it too likely that the coder will do something wrong (e.g. call `.to_str()` to try and get a stringly-typed path). This scenario doesn't hold for any other type I can think of.\n\nTheoretically, one could implement `Show` for `Path` but mark it as `#[deprecated]` with the appropriate suggestion to use `.display()`. But this suggestion has two serious flaws:\n1. It provides functionality that is strictly wrong. Yes, it's deprecated (although deprecating new API as it's introduced is quite weird), but it's still _there_.\n2. I don't think deprecation warnings will actually work on trait methods like this. Certainly not if the value is passed to a generic function accepting any `Show`. The warning would have to be on the trait impl itself, and I don't know if that's supported.\n\nIdeally, we'd have some way of providing a custom error message when attempting to use `Path` as a `Show`. Basically like deprecation, except forbidding the use of the API (while still providing it as something to hang the error message off of). I don't know how this would actually work, though, and it seems like perhaps overkill when it would only ever be used once in the standard libraries.\n\nInstead, I think we should just verify that the documentation is sufficient. Glancing at the docs for [`std::path`](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/path/index.html) I do see that it explains how `display()` works. That's only going to help people who actually read the module documentation, though. I don't know if we can do any better.\n",
