(Though there is an upgrade being worked on.)\n\nIDNA and the actual URL parser are not there yet, but everything else (host/domain/ipv6, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, percent encoding, test harness) is there. This should start being useful as soon as the URL parser is added.\n\nThe host parser returns an error on non-ASCII domains. This is good enough for now, IDNA support can be added later.\n\n@jgraham also made an in-progress implementation: https://gist.github.com/SimonSapin/7794849\nIt has some known bugs (`SeekableCharIterator` is incorrect with non-ASCII input, at least) but the parser code can probably be reused.\n",

It could be distributed with rustc like the rest of the modules moving out of extra, but this has the downside of tying rust-url upgrades to compiler upgrades, and only weak advantages IMO.\n\nSo, whenever the Rust team decides it\u2019s appropriate, I suggest removing `extra::url` and recommending rust-url as a replacement.\n",

    "body": "I\u2019d say rust-url is now in \"beta\" state. I have branches of rust-http and Servo using it:\nhttps://github.com/SimonSapin/rust-http/compare/rust-url\nhttps://github.com/SimonSapin/servo/compare/rust-url\n\nIt builds with Cargo. It depends on rust-encoding (which also builds with Cargo), but for something non-essential that could be deactivated if avoiding the additional dependency helps.\n\nI\u2019d like people to start using it and give feedback. I think the best way to do that is to get rid of the old liburl. I\u2019ll go through the RFC process, but before that, @alexcrichton what would you prefer?\n- Replace liburl with snapshots[*] of rust-url. You were in favor of this in February, but Cargo has reached alpha since then.\n- Just remove liburl, and tell people to use rust-url through Cargo.\n- Something else?\n\n[*] In any case, I\u2019d like to keep a separate rust-url repository that I can update in Servo independently of language upgrades.\n",
