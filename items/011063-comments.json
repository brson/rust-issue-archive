    "body": "Closing this as working as intended.\n\nSadly rustc isn't designed to be the easiest library to use right now, but rustc for better or for worse has a lot of inference based on `self_exe_path()` of where to find the target libraries to link against (it's tough to find another way). The best fix for this would be to specify the `sysroot` manually or to also specify an `addl_lib_search_path` (or something called along those lines). We arguably need better support for finding libraries when using rustc as a library, but for now I don't think that there's much in the way of improving this.\n\nIf there are ideas though about how to make guessing where the target libraries are more robust, then that would be fantastic to commit to rustc! For now though, with a lack of ideas, I'm going to close this issue.\n",
