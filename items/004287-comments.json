However, it's true that generics are less powerful than Haskell- or ML-style polymorphic, because Rust has no polymorphic types; _items_ rather than _types_ have type parameters. This was a design decision made very early on and so far there's been no particular reason we've seen to change it.\n",

Because we are operating at a low level, we don't have uniform representation and implicit boxing and so forth.  Therefore, like C++, we monomorphize generic functions---this implies that we would require an infinite set of functions to deal with recursive functions like the one you wrote here (note that other cases of polymorphic recursion work just fine, so long as they don't generate an infinite stream of types).

    "body": "I think it's worth clarifying here that in the two closed bugs immediately above, Rust isn't triggering an error at all, so polymorphic recursion sometimes goes completely unnoticed and just causes compilation to diverge.  It doesn't always even trigger an inlining error.  This makes it very hard to track down, so any improvement in detection and reporting would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks, guys!\n",

    "body": "I don't consider this fixed, because I don't think the error message is good enough in most cases.\n\nIdeally we would detect polymorphic recursion explicitly (rather than having it caught by our other safe-guards against infinite-regression), and explain the origin of it in the source program.\n\nE.g. say something like (off the top of my head):\n\n> The program cannot be compiled, because it has a cycle of calls that would require the function `fn test<T:Dot>(n: i32, i: i32, first: T, second: T) -> i32` to be instantiated infinitely often, starting with with the instantiations `T=Nil`, `T=Cons<Nil>`, `T=Cons<Cons<Nil>>` ...\n\n---\n\nIn this case it is a cycle of function calls that exposes polymorphic recursion, but in other cases like #33545, the polymorphic recursion arises more directly in a type like:\n\n``` rust\nenum E1<T> {\n    V1(T),\n    V2(Box<E1<E2<T>>>)\n}\n```\n\nwhere the type `E1<T>` requires instantiations `E1<E2<T>>`, `E1<E2<E2<T>>`, `E1<E2<E2<E2<T>>>`\n\n(so the error message would need to be adjusted accordingly for such cases.)\n\n---\n\nIn case its not clear, I still regard this as a low priority work item, but something that ideally would be addressed eventually.\n",
