    "body": "@pnkfelix Had a lot of good comments about this issue in #6046. Reproducing them here:\n\n> I was about to r+ this, since I agree that if we have to choose between \"all conditions are never public\" or \"all conditions are always public\", then I would choose the latter.\n> \n> But I stopped short, due to two things:\n> 1.   A comment / potential scope creep: This may be a sign of a general weakness in our module system. I.e., instead of requiring macro writers to have to build in pub declarations (or thread optional ones down from the caller; see 2 below), perhaps we should have an export item that can publicize names from a module. (Ideally an export item would be able to also rename identifiers, so that a local name could be short for ease of use by the module owner, but be given as descriptive a name as necessary on export.) Or maybe pub use could be adapted to serve as such a feature.\n> 2.   More specifically about this issue (and thus not scope creep): I generally agree that we need to be able to express public conditions, and so the current implementation of the condition! syntax is unsatisfactory. But perhaps instead of making every invocation of condition! publicize its identifier, we might want to achieve this effect via a use of the pub keyword. For example, by making two variants of the condition! form, and dispatch based on whether pub appears, like so:\n>    \n>    macro_rules! condition (\n>       { $c:ident: $in:ty -> $out:ty; } => {\n>           ...\n>       };\n>       { pub $c:ident: $in:ty -> $out:ty; } => {\n>           ...\n>       }\n>    )\n> \n> or, if we were to extend our macro system somewhat:\n> \n>    macro_rules! condition (\n>        { $access:keyword(pub)? $c:ident: $in:ty -> $out:ty; } => {\n>            $access mod $c {\n>                ...\n>            }\n>        };\n>    )\n> \n> where the $access expands to nothing if the pub (made optional by the ?) is absent from the input. (At least, as far > as I can tell we do not support code like the above right now; corrections welcome.)\n> 1. (ignore)\n> 2. (ignore)\n> 3.   Even if we did not want put the code in for both of the variants from (2.) above right now, it might be nice to try to encourage a property that identifiers exported from the module should have the word pub explicitly attached to them, no? That is, maybe your macro should be written as:\n>    \n>    macro_rules! condition (\n>       { pub $c:ident: $in:ty -> $out:ty; } => {\n>           pub mod $c {\n>               fn key(_x: @::core::condition::Handler<$in,$out>) { }\n>               ...\n>           }\n>       }\n>    )\n> \n> If you were to post a revised commit that took the approach outlined in (3.), so that we could introduce variant (2.) in a backwards compatible way later if we liked, I am pretty sure I would r+ it unreservedly.\n",

    "body": "I figured the problem would be that you can't actually make a condition private right now. We do have a `pub` and a non-`pub` variant of the `condition!` macro, but that's not quite sufficient. Currently resolve rules block this from working.\n\nIf you declare a pub condition, you'd expect:\n\n``` rust\npub mod condition_name {\n  pub static cond: ... = ...;\n}\n```\n\nWhich certainly works to make it public. If you declare a private condition, you would expect\n\n``` rust\nmod condition_name {\n  static cond: ... = ...;\n}\n```\n\nNow in theory you can access any member of your immediate children's modules, but that's not the case in this situation. Currently resolve bugs block this from working. Knowing that, you might want to generate code for private conditions like\n\n``` rust\nmod condition_name {\n  pub static cond: ... = ...;\n}\n```\n\nwhich indicates that you can reach your private child module to read cond. The owning module of the condition can certainly do that, but the bug in #5129 means that so can everyone else.\n\nI guess this isn't really blocked on #5129 per-se, but rather it's blocked on fixing resolve rules in general.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton So, one way to make \"progress\" on this ticket is to:\n1. change the expansion of `condition!` to be pub-preserving, i.e. pub declaration expands to pub mod, and non-pub declaration expands to non-pub mod (which corresponds to your first \"if you declare a private condition\" scenario; I will sidestep the question of whether the static `cond` inside the mod should be `pub` or not -- it depends on how the semantics of resolve get resolved), and then,\n2.  at every spot in the code base that cannot deal with that due to resolve issues, change those call-sites, adding a `pub` and a note pointing to one of the resolve issues.\n\nBasically, I don't think it's a great idea to build a resolve-workaround into a core macro like this, especially if the workaround itself is just as leaky as the per-call-site workaround.  (That is, I would understand if putting the work-around into the macro actually bought us anything, but it doesn't, its just making the resolve issues seem like less of a problem than they really are, because people are not aware of the extra pubs that are getting implicitly inserted into the macro expansions.)\n\nAny thoughts on that strategy?  Is it a waste of time?  (I'm going to give it a shot nonetheless.)\n",
