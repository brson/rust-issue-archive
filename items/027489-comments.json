    "body": "Definitely seems like #26777 broke pretty printing. Important to note that escaping the quotes would do nothing in a raw string anyway, i.e:\n\n``` rust\n#[doc = r\" \\\"It must be Thursday\\\", said Arthur.\"]\n```\n\nis still invalid. A short term fix is to bump up the delimiter count in the `StrRaw` token, but then it can be broken by comments containing `\"#`, e.g:\n\n``` rust\n/// Hello \"world\"#\n```\n\nwould become:\n\n``` rust\n#[doc = r#\" Hello \"world\"#\"#]\n```\n\nMaybe `#` should be escaped when desugaring doc comments?\n\nNot sure if this would break something else though considering `#` is used everywhere for markdown, example code, issue numbers, etc. Doc comments are complicated!\n",

    "body": "Oops, I forgot that `stringify!` can reveal the string representation. My apologies.\n\nI think a workaround to deal with this would be to increase the number of `#`s in the generated raw string literal. We could look up the number of successive `#`s in the original string and set the former number to the latter number + 1. In this case, the output would be like:\n\n``` rust\n#[doc = r#\" Returns the answer\"#] // Successive `#`s == 0, use r#\"literal\"#\n#[doc = r#\" \"It must be Thursday\", said Arthur.\"#] // Successive `#`s == 0, also use r#\"literal\"#\n#[doc = r###\" Ruin everything with \"## already \"###] // Successive `#`s == 2, use r###\"literal\"###\n```\n\nAny better ideas?\n",
