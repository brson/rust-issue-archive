    "body": "The actual problem is that `wcsftime` thinks input is latin1 regardless of system locale. (wow!)\nSo at least we don't get any `is_utf8()` assertion failure as before, but instead we get mojibake unicode string.\nFor example, in my machine, `extra::time::now().tm_zone` is `~\"\\xb4\\xeb\\xc7\\xd1\\xb9\\xce\\xb1\\xb9 \\xc7\\xa5\\xc1\\xd8\\xbd\\xc3\"` (which is in bytes `[0xC2, 0xB4, 0xC3, 0xAB, 0xC3, 0x87, 0xC3, ...`)\n\nAlso, I'm going to disable `extra::time` test on Windows: the test uses `std::os::setenv(\"TZ\", \"America/Los_Angeles\");` but Windows does not change timezone at all.\n",
