    "body": "The 2nd has the same problem: `Expected concrete lifetime. Is 'a as defined on the block at 6:45?` It still needs a break.\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2lkk4i/concrete_lifetime_vs_bound_lifetime/) is some discussion of this type of error however the error is still unclear. Which is a bound and which is concrete? What do the terms actually mean?\n\nThe error is also kinda odd because:\n\n``` rust\n fn next(&'a mut self) -> Option<&'a str>\n//                                      ^ It point to this as the problem\n//        ^ But this is the actual problem\n```\n",
