    "body": "I read over the proposal in more detail and I've got some thoughts and questions. First off, I think we may want to model this in the Rust model that I've been working on. This is, after all, what it's for -- to uncover complications that arise _before_ we are knee deep in implementation. Unfortunately the model is currently limited to the reduction semantics (no type system yet).\n\nSecond, here is an attempt to codify the rules that I see in what you wrote. Let me know if you think this is accurate:\n1. A type parameter declared as `..T` is required to be instantiated with a \"tuply\" type, meaning either an actual tuple type `(U, ...)` or another type parameter `U` also declared as `..U`. The aim here is to ensure that during monomorphization such types will ultimately be tuples.\n2. The (formal) type grammar is extended with new forms that include an expando type `Tz`. In each case, `Tz` must be a \"tuply\" type parameter (see below).\n- `(T1, ..., Tn, \"..\" Tz)` -- expando tuple\n- `fn(T1, ..., Tn, \"..\" Tz)` -- expano function type\n- `|T1, ..., Tn, \"..\" Tz|` -- expando closure type\n- `proc(T1, ..., Tn, \"..\" Tz)` -- expando proc type\n- `N<T1, ..., Tn, \"..\" Tz)` -- expando path type\n1. As a convenience, we allow users to write types like `(A, B, ..(C, D))` that are not part of the formal type grammar. We normalize such types immediately into the equivalent `(A, B, C, D)`. We also permit users to write `N<A,...,N, M, O>` and we normalize that to `N<A,...,N,(M,O)>`\n2. When substituting a value for an tuply type parameter, if the tuply is used in an expando position, the tuple is normalized. So for example applying the substitution `[..S => (C, D)]` to the type `(A, B, ..S)` yields the type `(A, B, C, D)`.\n3. The definitions of traits and expressions are also extended in a somewhat similar way. In the case of expressions, the \"expando\" values must be of tuply type.\n\nI think this largely holds together, but this is only a cursory examination. Mostly just trying to extract rules from the examples.\n\nI didn't think too hard about HKT, but my first thought is that a tuply type parameter just has kind `*` (it must after all be matched to a tuple, which is a type), and hence that this kind of \"fits in\" relatively ok.\n\n### Some questions / thoughts\n- I guess we want `..T` to declare a tuply type parameter vs a type bound `T:Tuple`, since it corresponds to syntactic sugar on the referencing side.\n- There is some ambiguity in various parts, e.g., the meaning of `..T:Trait` (does that mean that `T`, the tuple type, implements `Trait`? Or that all the types `..T` individually implement `Trait`?) Both have some value. To be consistent I imagine we'd have to add a notion like `..T:..Trait` to distinguish the difference.\n- At least one example is bogus, I believe. The description writes:\n\n```\ntype AppendTuple<T, U> = (..T, U);\ntype PrependTuple<T, U> = (U, ..T);\nAppendTuple<PrependTuple<Tuple<B>, A>, C> => (A, B, C)\n```\n\nBut by the rules I gave above this an error, because `T` (as declared n `AppendTuple` and `PrependTuple`) was not declared as tuply. Hence it should be:\n\n```\ntype AppendTuple<..T, U> = (..T, U);\ntype PrependTuple<..T, U> = (U, ..T);\nAppendTuple<PrependTuple<Tuple<B>, A>, C> => (A, B, C)\n```\n",

I think we'll need a rule like \"at most one tuply type parameter on any given type\" to prevent ambiguity. I could _imagine_ this creating problems, though. Another option might be that we require users to provide tuple types for the values of tuply type parameters -- or maybe permit either `U` (normalized to `(U,)` for convenience) or `(U, V)`. I think I prefer that to trying to be convenient. \n\nIn other words, given `Fn<..A,R> { ... }`: `Fn<(T1,T2),T3>` would be required and not equivalent to `Fn<T1,T2,T3>`. But we would permit `Fn<T1,T2>` and normalize it to `Fn<(T1,),T2>`, just because the 1-tuple syntax is so unfortunate.\n",

    "body": "@eddyb wrote to me on IRC that I was misinterpreting the meaning of `..T` in a declaration. He intended it to mean that it \"scoops up\" multiple arguments and makes a tuple out of them, and not to allow a tuple to be provided at the instantitation site. Re-reading, I see that this fits with what he wrote, in particular it makes things like `VoidFn<A,B,C>` make sense. I think much of what I wrote still applies; the type parameter `T` there is \"tuply\" in that it always corresponds to a tuple type. I will attempt later to revise the rules into something that fits with that interpretation.\n",

The primary incentive to have them at all though is function parameter lists, which are simply-kinded, so maybe this is not a problem.\n",
