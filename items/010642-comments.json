    "body": "@cmr often, changes will be obvious (e.g. adding new keywords, or prelude changes\u2014the prelude items are contained in the Vim syntax file). Where it's not, it's probably best to assign certain regions deemed to have such cases to specific people. For example, I'd be delighted to accept responsibility for the Vim config, so that any time there is anything which will require work on the Vim config the author or reviewer (I believe review needs to be more thorough than it typically is, a surprising number of problems have been creeping through) will mention me and I'll come and help.\n\nMaintaining a tree of responsibility (separately) might work:\n\n```\n+ mk/: Person X\n+ src/: brson\n  + librustc/\n  + libstd/\n    + somefile.rs: Another Person\n  + etc/\n    + vim/: Chris Morgan\n```\n\nThis would have the added benefit of making it clear who someone should talk to about changes to a certain area of the code base.\n\nOf course, that uncovers the nest of decaying code which has no owner and is in fact unmaintained and often in consequence buggy and broken.\n\nThis is now distinctly out of scope for this issue. I shall raise it on the mailing list.\n",
