  "body": "The first few commits are all refactorings that should not affect anything.  The last commit is the important part.  There is one caveat, which is that it was a bit hard for me to test some of the method stuff: it seems to do the right thing, but the current code also passes the tests, though it shouldn't, I think due to various bugs in the mode.rs code.  So I may have some more patches coming along.\n\nr? @brson\n",
