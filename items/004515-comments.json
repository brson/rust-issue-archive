You use it like this:\n\n```\n#[bench]\nfn bench1(bh: & mut std::test::BenchHarness) {\n    let mut x = 1;\n    do bh.iter {\n        x += 1;\n        x ^= 2 * x;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe separation is to allow you to do some scaffolding setup in the pre-iter part and then have the benchmark tool just measure the speed of the inner loop passed to `.iter`.\n",
