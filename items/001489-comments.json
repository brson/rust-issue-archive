    "body": "In the case of [GHC](http://haskell.org/ghc), all executables can accept certain flags at runtime which are passed onto the runtime system controlling various options like this. For example, if `foo.hs` is compiled to `foo.exe`, then you can invoke `foo.exe` and specify a maximum stack size like:\n\n```\n$ ./foo.exe arg1 arg2 arg3 +RTS -K512k -RTS\n```\n\nAnything inbetween the magical `+RTS` and `-RTS` flags are interpreted by the runtime system (and if there is no `-RTS` flag, then all the remaining flags following `+RTS` are interpreted as flags for the runtime.) This can also control things like the amount of OS threads to spread lightweight threads across, etc.\n\nWhile this _does_ steal the `+RTS` and `-RTS` arguments away from every compiled executable, in practice it doesn't seem to be too much of a problem I think. This is an easy way to let every compiled executable have its own settings at runtime, with a reasonable default should nothing be specified\n\nA sidenote: recent GHC currently doesn't quite let you do this, because there's a security concern where you could execute a program and DoS the machine by specifying an abundant amount of threads, huge amount of memory, etc. So by default it's rather conservative in some of the things it allows you to pass to the `+RTS`.\n\nAt the same time, GHC lets you handle the situation of no `-rtsopts` but needing special RTS options a few ways, check out the docs here: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.2.2/html/users_guide/runtime-control.html\n\nPerhaps the `-rtsopts` flag is a bit overkill here, but I think the general idea works pretty well in practice.\n",
