    "body": "I agree 100% with removing the legacy trailing `\\0` from our strings for the reasons given in my comments on the issue report.\n\nIt doesn't have to happen as part of this pull request, but we should really switch `Path` to using `[u8]` internally. At the moment it's not possible to handle files without Unicode paths, despite many filesystems allowing it. The same thing applies to environment variables, as they are not necessarily UTF-8.\n\nI think we'll find most places using `str` for interaction with C were doing so incorrectly, especially since it's impossible for a function using `\\0`-termination to support all of UTF-8. File paths are one of the few things really guaranteed to never contain `\\0`.\n\nI'll hold off on an r+ because this deserves more attention than most pull requests.\n",

    "body": "@brson: Maybe I didn't document my intentions of CString owning or not owning the returned pointer well enough. One of the more obnoxious things to deal with in C is who owns the pointer. `strcpy` obviously returns a pointer that should be freed, but `getenv` returns a pointer that should not be freed. I wanted to allow library writers embed this information into CString.\n\nThat said, this api may be a little half baked at the moment and I'd be okay with removing this feature for now. Perhaps instead I should follow `extra::c_vec` and instead allow a user to pass in a destructor function to allow CString to work with other allocators.\n",

    "body": "Merging because this is a big annoying bitrotty change and feels like the _main_ API surface of it won't change much in the future.\n\nI too am a little concerned about ownership being controlled by a flag, and by the dtor calling free. I think this difference may be significant enough to represent at the type level? I'm unsure. I can think of a number of other ways of representing it, few of which seem like they are particularly safe / footgun-proof. I'd _love_ to be able to leverage lifetimes for this, such that (say) a `CStringOwner` can produce a `CStringRef<'r>` that points to the former and couples their lifetimes together. Or something? This is basically akin to the slice problem we had in normal strings, but for strings-that-C-will-like. I'm not the best at rust API design, sadly. But it seems to me the shorter the duration raw pointers emerge from the API surface, the better.\n\nAlso somewhat concerned about `str::to_c_str`: it calls `as_bytes().to_c_str()` which doesn't wind up verifying that the string in question lacks internal nulls, or is valid in the target locale-encoding, both of which are motivating concerns for this work.\n\nAlso ergonomically a bit concerned with `to_c_str().with_ref` since it's a long and chatty invocation, and hits a path that definitely allocates an owning buffer even though it's clearly a temporary use. Could we add a to_c_str_ref() combination function that allocates into a temporary buffer (and say, uses a small stack-local array for strings less than 128 bytes? that's likely most of them..)\n",
