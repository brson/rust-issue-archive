    "body": "Wow. Great! Excited to see this.\n\n> At a high level it is an explicit non goal to enable building outside of a MinGW shell\n\nminor nit: MinGW shell -> MSYS shell :)\n\n> this commit alters the compiler to attach the dllexport attribute to all LLVM functions that are reachable\n\nSee also [this comment of #7196](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/7196#issuecomment-44361212). The change is, therefore, necessary to MinGW part as well.\n\n> The flipside of this situation is that whenever you link to a dll and you import a function from it, the import should be tagged with dllimport.\n> At this time, however, the compiler does not emit dllimport for any declarations other than constants (where it is required),\n\nThis is also true for MinGW/gcc side, isn't it? I've heard that [dllimport is an optimization for functions, but a requirement for data](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4489441/why-when-is-declspec-dllimport-not-needed). But then I'm curious why we haven't have such issue with gcc.\n",

The change is, therefore, necessary to MinGW part as well.\n\n...\n\n> This is also true for MinGW/gcc side, isn't it? I've heard that [dllimport is an optimization for functions, but a requirement for data](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4489441/why-when-is-declspec-dllimport-not-needed). But then I'm curious why we haven't have such issue with gcc.\n\n...\n\n> @klutzy: gnu ld links to dll data using a bit of magic called [`auto-import`](http://blog.omega-prime.co.uk/?p=115) (edit: wrong url).\n\nFascinating! The article from @vadimcn was quite informative and I suspect that's why everything \"just works\" today. I think we may want to even investigate turning off the `auto-import` flag by default, but it may be a little late in the game to do that.\n\n---\n\n@vadimcn \n\n> @alexcrichton: `configure` seems to have a problem with msvc root path containing spaces.  What is the exact command line one is supposed to use?\n\nAh yeah I forgot to mention that, but `--arg=\"val with spaces\"` is currently broken with our configure script, so I've been ensuring that `cl.exe` is in my PATH and then I invoke `./configure --host=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc,x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` in a MSYS2 shell.\n",

I suspect that if `link.exe` has official support for manifest (and if GNU ld does not) that it should be easy enough for builds to use `-C link-args`, and otherwise adding some sort of interface for this would require adding API surface area to the compiler itself. Definitely possible to solve in the near future, but may best wait for a follow-up PR.\n",

    "body": "@Manishearth \n\n> As mentioned in the PR it doesn't attempt to allow for builds outside of an msys shell.\n\nTo confirm what @retep998 said, this does not require that the compiler itself be run from a msys shell, just building the compiler itself. Rust today does not need to be run from an msys shell, and this PR does not change that.\n\n---\n\n@luser \n\n> This all sounds pretty sensible, although as we discussed we are going to need debug symbols in order to ship any Rust code in Firefox.\n\nCurrently this PR is just the bare-bones to get the compiler to bootstrap so we can start setting up automation and testing for all of this, but so long as LLVM has support for this then it's probably not too hard for us to support it!\n\n> I'm not sure whether unwinding is a hard requirement for us, aside from \"generate unwind info in the debug info\".\n\nIt looks like upstream LLVM has lots more support for SEH unwinding than the current revision we're using, and I plan on updating our version of LLVM soon so we can bind this support as well, so this should all be coming soon!\n\n> So this raises an interesting question that I hadn't realized--Gecko builds its own jemalloc on all platforms, can we make Rust code use our jemalloc instead of trying to provide another copy?\n\nCurrently there's not a great story for doing this, unfortunately. When building the standard library itself you can disable our bundled version of jemalloc, and in this scenario Rust just allocates memory via malloc/free/realloc/etc. There is currently no means to take a binary copy of the standard library and request that generated binaries/libraries do not use the bundled jemalloc. There have been many discussions on this in the past though, and it's something we'd very much like to do!\n\nRight now I suspect that Rust in Gecko is likely using a separate instance of the jemalloc allocator, which I suspect is far from ideal! \n",

Remove all the guarded inclusions and C99 fallback implementations for VS < v2015 and avoid all (well [most of](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/04/29/c-11-14-17-features-in-vs-2015-rc.aspx)) the non-std code for MSVC. ;)\n\nSince there is VS2015's full featured 'community' and 'express-for-desktop' versions available for free of cost, the Windows users will have enough choices: MinGW, VS2015 pro/ultimate/express-for-desktop/community to build the Rust solution.\n\nBesides, you guys have made the win32 installer available for mainstream consumer. Building from scratch is only for enthusiasts and contributors, so I don't see it as a real deal-breaker.\n\nNote that two main Windows supporting CI systems: AppVeyor and Jenkins already support VS2015 RC. :)\n",
