    "body": "@fhahn I'm not really sure what @arielb1 meant by this, actually:\n\n> We can always keep the algorithm with a stupid linear search - that will not be too slow for error messages.\n\nI _think_ @arielb1 was proposing that we do a linear search through the impls and compare the simplified types. But I'm not sure if that makes sense, since it will yield the same results as the hashtable lookup, and that is clearly faster. I would have thought that the main concern would be that we might tighten how \"simplified types\" work to make them more precise, which might then in turn cause the error message to become less useful (since the point here is that, indeed, the types are NOT an exact match). So @arielb1 what precisely did you have in mind? (Another variant one might consider is doing a linear search but checking the simplified type across _all_ type operands, not just `Self`.)\n",
