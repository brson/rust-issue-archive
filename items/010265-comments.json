    "body": "After some investigation, I found out that the 'extern mod foo(name=\"bar\")' form creates a view item with attached metaitem having key \"name\" and value \"bar\". The 'extern mod foo = \"bar\"' form creates a view item with two metaitems, one with key \"name\" and value \"bar\", and other with key \"package_id\" and also value \"bar\". This happens in rustc::metadata::creader, function visit_view_item, and it appends the whole path as package_id and only the filestem as name, but in this case both are equal. So in rustc::metadata::loader, find_library_crate_aux finds the crate to load but metadata_matches requires the \"package_id\" metaitem to be present in the \"bar\" crate. \n\nI confirmed this with my above example by adding 'package_id=\"world\"' item in the link attribute above (world.rs), and it worked even with 'extern mod w = \"world\"' in main.rs. \n\nSo this amounts to the \"package_id\" being mandatory in external crates. \n",
