    "body": "Thanks for the PR!\n\nI've tried to reach @anchovieshat (and xales) on IRC, but to no avail. I would definitely like to coordinate on the effort here, as I am beginning implementation work on the [runtime removal RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230) this week. In particular, while Servo does plan to eventually remove all reliance on libgreen, this will take some time, and I don't want to cause unnecessary pain in the meantime.\n\nI was envisioning removing the libgreen crate as the _last_ step in this process, based on my discussions with the Servo team. My plan was to start by migrating `std::io` incrementally away from the trait-based interface to bind directly to a version of libnative under the `std` facade. Transitioning I/O, and also reworking the `std::io` APIs, is the top priority in terms of the 1.0 horizon. Next is TLS, which we hope to have a revamped API for. The lowest priority is actually removing the scheduler infrastructure -- in part because this will be the hardest aspect for Servo to migrate away from.\n\nIn any case, please reach out to me on IRC so that we can avoid duplicated or out-of-order work.\n",
