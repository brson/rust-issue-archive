    "body": "I concur that the first point is a clear win; it's important to acknowledge that there are times when people simply don't care to specify the argument and return types of their closures.\n\n+1 to allowing parens to be omitted when there are no arguments. This is really no different from omitting the `-> ()` in the absence of a returned value. (Wishful thinking: perhaps this could even apply to functions declared in the usual sense?)\n\nI think that paren-less calls for trailing closures are one of Rust's \"hey, that's pretty neat\" features, but I'm not especially attached to them (though I'd be a little sad to see them go). However this one is decided, the stack closure syntax should work the same way.\n",

Something like this:\n\n```\n{ a, b -> ... } (stack closure)\n{ a, b @> ... } (boxed closure)\n{ a, b ~> ... } (unique closure)\n```\n\nIn use it would look like:\n\n```\nvec::iter(v) { i -> \n    ...\n}\n```\n\nWith no arguments, the arrow is still required:\n\n```\ntask::spawn { ~>\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThere are some problems: \n- There is a minor inconsistency in that stack closures ought to be `&>` but that just looks so...weird (especially as it is by far the common case).\n- We need arbitrary lookahead.  So we have to write some little routine in the parser that skips forward to see if it can find an arrow or a ':' (the latter would indicate a type annotation on a parameter, and is not valid expression syntax).  In practice this is probably not a huge deal.\n- If we want to allow explicit return type annotation, it's not clear how to do that, since we've stolen the \"return type arrow\" (but I think this is probably not a requirement).\n- It no longer looks like Ruby or Smalltalk.\n",

    "body": "@graydon - spawn always infers `~`. The original goal if this issue was to remove that inference entirely, make it always explicit.\n\nIf we are going to keep the inference then adding the sigils is less important, though it probably will allow block syntax in places where we currently have to use the long syntax.\n\nIt's a shame that this will add yet more ways to write functions. If we want to keep the kind inference then I think my inclination is to leave the block syntax alone and make the long syntaxes easier to use by allowing both the argument types and return types to be omitted.\n",

    "body": "Some thoughts on the matter:\n- When the work on mutable local variables is complete (working on it...) and the no copies proposal is implemented (not started yet), it will only be legal to implicitly copy immutable variables of simple types.  This will allay some of the concerns about not understanding which kind of closure you're getting, as it should make no semantic difference, though the costs will vary some.  \n- It seems like a no-brainer to allow types to be dropped from explicit `fn()` style declarations.  I _think_ this would be easy, I may try it off on a branch and see if any complications arise.\n- I had a thought about the capture clause syntax.  Currently, it is `fn@[copy x; move y](z: int)`.  Perhaps the captured variables should come at the end of the parameter list: `fn@(z: int; copy x; move y) {...}`.  This would fit nicely with the sugared closure syntax: `{|z; copy x; move y|...}`.\n",
