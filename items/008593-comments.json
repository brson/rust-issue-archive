The problem here is that while B is an illegal type, that check is not run until after A is checked.\n\nThe compiler should instead maintain a cache of \"types which have been occurs-checked\", and for forward-references like this, additionally check the nested type if it doesn't appear in the cache yet.\n",

There's a whole array of issues with recursive unbounded-sized types, but I don't think it helps much to keep separate issues open for all of them when they're likely all related. This will be linked in #2063 though, and I will comment that this should be taken care of as well.\n",
