There used to be such a table that was used to decide whether a variable would be treated as \"immediate\" or stored on the stack.  However, I thought that sully removed the use of this table a while and just stored all variables on the stack, as this is apparently what clang does anyway and makes things simple: so perhaps there is another table? Or I am wrong about this table having been removed? In either case, the fix is probably to modify the criteria used for listing things in this table, it's no doubt some sort of over-eager and possibly premature optimization.\n",
