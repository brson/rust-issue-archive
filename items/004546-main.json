  "body": "I was looking into the `difference` method on the bit vector implementations, and I found that it didn't quite align with what I thought of as the difference between two sets.\n\nFor `SmallBitv`, the difference was just the xor of the two vectors, which I'm not really sure what it's supposed to represent. For `BigBitv`, it almost did the difference except that it added in lots of bits which weren't related to the two bit vectors.\n\nI figured that the difference method should return the set-wise difference:\n\n```\nA / B = { x : x in A and x not in B }\n```\n\nso I updated both of the difference methods to do that and added some tests to do that. If this isn't right, the two implementations (SmallBitv/BigBitv) appear to do different things, so they should probably be unified to one thing anyway.\n",
