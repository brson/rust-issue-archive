    "body": "This pass is becoming complex enough that it should no longer be using ad-hoc rules for determining whether an item is private or public. This pass was originally implemented before there was a comprehensive privacy analysis pass (explaining why it duplicates the logic of privacy).\n\nWith that in mind, the code should get restructured to using a combination of the `exported_items` set from the privacy set along with the `reexport_map2` from the resolve pass. The `exported_items` set contains all directly exported node ids in the AST, or otherwise all those which are \"public all the way\". The `reexport_map2` is keyed by module id, and it should be used to traverse the public reexports of publicly visible modules.\n\nI think that the privacy pass may want to output a more usable form of information which is the set of all publicly reachable items (you currently must recompute that based off the two maps above), but that may be a separate issue as well.\n\nRegardless, seeing how this pass is getting more complicated, it's time to start using the real analysis pass of the compiler. Additionally, I believe that once the results of privacy are being used that the `MissingDocVisitor` can be removed entirely so we can have one and only one lint visitor.\n",
