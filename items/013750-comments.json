    "body": "@kballard I've now expanded existing unit tests for `stat` and `lstat` to also check the convenience methods.\n\nAs a sidenote, the rationale for when functionality should be exposed as a function versus a method (or both) wasn't entirely clear to me. I brought it up on IRC, but discussion was inconclusive -- the main benefit of methods seem to be that you don't need imports to get access to them. In any case, it seems a shame to have (notably, error-prone) boilerplate like these wrapper methods, which then requires redundant testing. But for this patch, I'm sticking with the existing pattern.\n",
