We do [plan on allowing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0517-io-os-reform.md#sockets) advanced configuration of sockets other than the high level convenience constructors of `TcpListener::bind` for example. I also don't mind creating an RFC issue to start tracking this sort of implementation as I'd love to start work on it sooner rather than later!\n",

    "body": "To add these now an RFC would be written, but I would recommend creating a \"`std::net` wishlist issue\" along the lines of that [for `std::fs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/939), we may consolidate these at one point into another umbrella issue but it's good to keep track of feature requests for `std::net`.\n\nI don't think that we want the second patch for now, however. We've been recently moving a bit away from that sort of compatibility across OSes. For example the code to explicitly prevent opening a directory was removed along with special Windows-specific code to remove readonly files. We've been moving more in a direction that the implementation of the underlying primitive is clear and easy to understand without having any form of \"magic\" happening under the hood (e.g. setting some options only on some platforms). I do understand that this make is such that the precise behavior is not cross platform, but that is somewhat of an inevitability.\n",
