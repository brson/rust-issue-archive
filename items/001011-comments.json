    "body": "The \"standard\" thing to do on win32 is to put all the .dll files a particular .exe depends on in the same directory as the .exe. That directory is automatically searched when resolving .dlls.\n\nWe can do this in the makefile by a post-build step that moves from $host/lib to $host/bin, or else in the nsis installer logic. Doesn't really matter, but my feeling is the former is a bit better since it means we can stop twiddling $PATH altogether on the windows command lines. Easier for devs to invoke rustc in their working directory.\n",
