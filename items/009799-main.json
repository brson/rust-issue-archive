  "body": "r? @metajack When I started writing the rustpkg tests, task failure didn't set the\nexit code properly. But bblum's work from July fixed that. Hooray! I\njust didn't know about it till now.\n\nSo, now rustpkg uses exit codes in a more conventional way, and some of\nthe tests are simpler.\n\nThe bigger issue will be to make task failure propagate the error message.\nRight now, rustpkg does most of the work in separate tasks, which means if\na task fails, rustpkg can't distinguish between different types of failure\n(see #3408)\n",
