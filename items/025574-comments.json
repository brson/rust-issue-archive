You can then test using the stage1 build and only do a full bootstrap when you are happy with your work. Other than that, long build times are just part of life for rust compiler hackers, sorry.\n",

From my understanding the piece of code mentioned in the issue should be equal to [the next one](http://is.gd/bpT4gS) where I substitute the constant's value directly into the pattern:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    match *b\"xxxx\" {\n        *b\"fooo\" => {},\n        _ => {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt fails with\n\n```\n<anon>:3:9: 3:10 error: unexpected token: `*`\n<anon>:3         *b\"fooo\" => {},\n```\n\nwhich means (as far as I understand) that it is not enough to just add constant-to-pattern expansion but also modify match to support matching of dereferenced literals.

I've been meaning to write up something on this, will do so soon, but the TL;DR is that we always use structural equality, even if (e.g.) the `Eq` trait is not implemented, or is implemented differently.\n\nThat said, I imagine this use case ought to work, but there are many others that don't which I don't really think ought to work. I'm not sure I'd call this an E-easy bug, though, but I guess that's because I tend to think that we need to do more overhaul of our constant treatment (and especially in patterns).\n",
