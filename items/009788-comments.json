    "body": "Hmm, I think the real problem is that bare fns and raw pointers should not be considered scalars. I suspect that the reason they are considered scalars, however, is to enable other kinds of casts (e.g., `uint` to `*int`). I know that this is one way to get null pointers in static constants, where transmute is disallowed, though I think that these days we could also use `Option<*int>` etc instead. In general I'd prefer to fix the \"is_scalar\" categorization than to patch up the typeck side of the equation -- but overall I'm not precisely sure which casts should be legal. @jdm -- you've done a lot of the work on static constants, does this ring any bells?\n",

Also what about bare_fn => Raw Pointer?\n\nSeems the next step here is to remove the Integer <=> Raw Pointer and Raw Pointer <=> Raw Pointers casts.
