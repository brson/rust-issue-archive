    "body": "I based this on the format output by python's argparse library. It's not adequate for programs with lots of options (like rustc) which is why I left it as a separate function instead of integrating it with the main `usage` function, so that its use would be left to the user's discretion. If an additional tag were added to options to mark them as \"less important\" and only display them in the list help, abbreviating them under [options..] in the usage summary, that could be make to work for more complex interfaces also.\n\nToday I've started writing a more complete argument parsing library, which will handle more combinations of options, as well as positional arguments (which need to be handled completely adhoc with getopts), and hopefully will be a good replacement for getopts, especially since it's being split from extra. For this reason I'll refrain from any extensive additions to getopts at this time. I'd appreciate if people could comment with things they'd wish to see on such a library.\n",
