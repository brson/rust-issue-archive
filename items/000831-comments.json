    "body": "I think this basically isn't a bug. Fundamentally, type abbreviations are abbreviations and so using them with phantom type arguments just isn't going to work properly. Since we have structural types, chan<int> and chan<float> would be the same type!\n\nThe solution is using tag types, which actually does introduce a new, real, type constructor. Unfortunately #833 makes this a bit more annoying than it should be.\n",
