This means that there are two versions of the `Hash` trait in play. What you're seeing is that you're using the _tested_ `Vec`, but the _libstd_ `Option`. Note that the _libstd_ `Hash` trait is implemented for `Option`, but not for the _tested_ `Vec`.\n\nThe fix would be to implement the _tested_ `Hash` for the _libstd_ `Option`, or some similar munging of the names or fiddling of imports to make sure you're importing the right thing. Another alternative would not be to test the tested `Vec`, but rather test the libstd `Vec`.\n",
