  "body": "- Kind-check closure bounds (a few cases are missing; I think for each one that missing it is conservative rather than unsound).\n- Parse, type-check, and 1/2 kind-check trait bounds.\n\nThis is pretty much all I can do before a snapshot.\n\nThe next step is to change the way boxed traits kind-check, which will involve lifting one restriction in `kind.rs` and imposing several others in `type_contents`. To do that I will need to actually add bounds to traits in unrelated code, which requires them to parse to begin with, which requires a snapshot.\n\nr? @nikomatsakis @pcwalton\n",
