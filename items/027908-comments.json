    "body": "Since `drop` and `forget` is in the `mem` module I would argue for `drop_in_place` to be there as well. Even though it is an unsafe intrinsic instead of a safe convenience function it still interacts with the `Drop` trait just as `drop` and `forget` does. On the other hand the `ptr` module only indirectly interacts with `Drop`.\n\nFor the choice between `&mut` and `*mut` I have less of an opinion. I were going to say that there are already `Drop` implementations that invalidate the `&mut self` pointer but I couldn't actually think of a case where this happens. Virtually all Drop implementations have a `*mut` which their memory is allocated behind which becomes invalid but the `&mut self` itself pointer is always valid for types such as `Vec`, `HashMap` etc.\n",

    "body": "@KalitaAlexey not currently, no.\n\n@Marwes perhaps yeah, although the placement of `mem` vs `ptr` today currently just largely has to do with the types of the arguments (e.g. raw pointers or \"safe\" values). Basically if we stabilize with `*mut T` it would be unconventional to place it in the `mem` module (and vice versa if we stabilize with `&mut T`).\n\nMy thinking for using a raw pointer is that if you're calling `drop_in_place` you're pretty unlikely to have a safe mutable pointer to the data in the first place anyway. For example the `Rc` and `Arc` both have to go through a `*mut RcBox<T>` to get at the underlying value.\n",

    "body": "@briansmith this isn't necessarily related to compiler optimizations, it's just replacing the old method of dropping a value by doing so via `ptr::read`. The compiler already doesn't copy anything around to call destructors, it just prevents calling the `drop` method directly. This is essentially providing the ability to do so, but it works in a generic context and works with trait objects. as well.\n",
