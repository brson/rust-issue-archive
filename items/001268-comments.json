Instead, can we just generate the hashed filename and call 'touch libfoo.so' in the build rules to satisfy make?\n- We need to update 'make clean' to delete these hash-based libraries\n- We need to update the snapshot scripts to handle hash-based libraries \n- I'm worried about what happens when we've globbed-copied these libraries around for a while. It seems like we'll eventually end up with multiple libraries with the same version but different hashes.\n",

All inline comments given to the previous pull request are no longer listed on this page. Or, do we prefer close old pull request and open new one in such case?)\n\nI've also removed the change about including hashes of dependencies from my previous pull request. Because there is not discrimination about direct and indirect dependencies in the current implementation. I would prefer only include hashes of direct dependent crates, and encoding hash and hashes of direct dependencies into crates metadata. There are a few other details I'm not clear of. So I think it's better to start a new series on that.\n\nOne thing in particular is what should be hashed? According to comments about build_link_meta:\n\n```\n *  - Define CMETA as all the non-name, non-vers exported meta tags in the\n *    crate (in sorted order).\n *\n *  - Define CMH as hash(CMETA).\n *\n```\n\nIf version is not hashed, I wonder how can it be transited across the dependency DAG.\n",
