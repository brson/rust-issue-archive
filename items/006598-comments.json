I'm rewriting `sync::rwlock` to use an atomic uint for performance, and in some cases I'd like to use the relaxed consistency ordering.\n\nI don't expect the assembly would change at all on a strongly-consistent architecture, unless LLVM decided on its own to reorder the instructions. I _do_ expect that we'd see a difference on ARM -- we could save a few global barrier instructions.\n",
