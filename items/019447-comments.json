I personally prefer not using generics wherever possible, and it seems like somewhat overkill in this case as just because we can accept something doesn't necessarily mean we should take the monomorphization/documentation hit.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for being patient @csouth3! After thinking about with with respect to https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/517 I don't think that this is actually the direction that we want to go in. We've realized that paths are not actually piles of bytes but rather piles of bytes on unix and piles of u16 on windows. This means that eventually this is not the right bound for this function.\n\nIdeally this bound would be `AsPath` or `AsOsStr`, but the `OsStr` one is a bit odd and it's not necessarily a `Path` but rather a suffix to a path. In light of this I think we'll want to stick to `&str` for now (the common language of paths as unicode), and we can generalize later if necessary. Thanks for the PR regardless!\n",
