    "body": "> Rust does already support full ASLR / full RELRO via `-C link-args=\"-pie -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now\"`\n\nCool. That's quite a mouthful compared to `-H` though. :)  I want to make \"more secure and somewhat slower\" a preference that users can easily express, similar to how `-O` expresses \"faster to run and slower to compile and harder to debug\" without getting into the details of every optimization pass.\n\n> In order for ASLR to be useful, you need to prevent leaking a pointer to any symbol as it gives away the randomized base, and Rust permits this in safe code. To be truly useful as a statistical defense rather than security through obscurity, _full_ RELRO is required\n\nSure, Rust allows creating such a leak in safe code, but it's not the most common thing to do, and the attacker has to find a way to access it in the relevant attack scenario (which could be remote or have a limit on attempts), and even if they _do_ find the leak, you've forced them to spend resources doing so, which is what these mitigations are all about.\n\nI don't think the question of what things are possible in safe code is very relevant, anyway. For any code where these mitigations come into play, the memory safety system has already failed, or doesn't try to provide any guarantees (`unsafe` and foreign code).  The safe dialect shouldn't and doesn't need to prevent you from doing anything that might decrease the effectiveness of exploit mitigations; they are fundamentally an unsound, defense-in-depth thing.\n\nOf course it would be easy to get such a leak in a system which uses `unsafe` to sandbox attacker-controlled code. But in that case you're already trusting the typechecker to a huge degree, and it seems moot to complain that it can't also prevent loopholes in a last-ditch countermeasure.\n\nThere's no actual sharp line between \"security through obscurity\" and \"statistical defense\"; it's all about how much the attacker spends versus how much you spend. And ASLR is very cheap on AMD64 (see [my benchmarks](http://mainisusuallyafunction.blogspot.com/2012/05/automatic-binary-hardening-with.html)).  It's probably cheap on ARM too, although I haven't checked.  The question of which mitigations are enabled at which `--harden-level` will certainly be platform specific.\n\n> and at the moment that means forcing on immediate binding but it might not in the future.\n\nInteresting; how do you do RELRO without immediate binding?\n\nAlso I don't understand why RELRO is a prerequisite for useful ASLR.  In my understanding, ASLR is about making it hard to find out where things are.  RELRO is about preventing writes to certain executable pages (inter alia) even knowing where those pages are.  So if you have some RWX pages, but it's hard for the attacker to find them, that's still a win.\n\n> Chromium also does ASLR in userspace for memory allocations, because the OS ASLR is usually very weak. For example, Linux without PaX patches will still just lay out each `mmap` precisely after the last one as it only ever randomizes the starting point.\n\nDang, I didn't realize Linux's ASLR is that bad >_>.  But static exec ASLR is still a big win.  Programs that aren't doing dynamic code loading / generation will have all their executable pages randomized, which is important for preventing [ROP](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/hovav/papers/s07.html).\n\nAnyway with this ticket I mostly had compiler features in mind.  Hardening allocator libraries seems pretty separate although I would certainly be happy to see that as well.  There is plenty of allocator hardening you can do beyond randomization, as well.\n\n> The stack canaries cause a 1-10% performance hit and a 1-15% code size increase.\n\nUbuntu builds all packages with stack canaries [by default](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features#stack-protector).  They do [PIE for ASLR](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features#pie) on certain high-security packages and would do it for everything on AMD64 if not for issues of compatibility with existing code.  Debian also [hardens many packages](https://wiki.debian.org/Hardening).  [Mosh](http://mosh.mit.edu/) built from source uses whatever hardening is supported by the platform.\n\nMy point is that this stuff is even today becoming the norm, and if we don't support it, that's a serious regression from C to unsafe-Rust, or even Rust that links C libraries (recall that a non-PIE Rust binary will provide ROP gadgets for an exploit in a perfectly hardened C library).  Yes, there is sometimes a performance penalty, and users can decide how they feel about that, much as they decide whether to use `-O`.\n\n> They're aimed at stopping vulnerabilities due to C strings more than anything else and include a `\\0` to stop those functions from going past the end of the stack frame.\n\nI don't think that's fair or accurate. Sure, an AMD64 Linux glibc canary contains one NULL byte, it might as well.  But it also contains seven random bytes.  Checking those bytes before return will catch attempts to overflow stack buffers that aren't strings. I'm confident I can find many examples of this mitigation being effective in practice.\n\nActually I suspect that NULL byte is there, as the LSB i.e. first in memory, to stop C string functions from _reading_ the canary value and leaking it to the attacker, who can then include it in a stack-smash attempt that might have nothing to do with strings and can happen in a completely different function.\n\nFor anyone interested, here's code to print the stack canary on AMD64 Linux:\n\n``` .rs\n#![feature(asm)]\nfn main() {\n    let canary: u64;\n    unsafe {\n        asm!(\"movq %fs:0x28, $0\" : \"=r\"(canary))\n    };\n    println!(\"{:016x}\", canary);\n}\n```\n",
