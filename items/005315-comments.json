    "body": "Reproduced with 517bfc91d1481cb8b247c7a5f19528136987ee4e .\n\nThe bug also comes up if you omit the type signature on `f`. I poked at this a little bit -- it looks like trans stores a `**fn(int)` into `f`, but the code generated for the call `f(4)` treats `f``as if it's a``*f``. Then I got confused as to which part of the code was correct. I think this isn't critical for 0.7.\n",
