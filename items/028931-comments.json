The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @brson (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "The other option - checking after each iteration if we already found the current type, scales much worse though. While simply relying on the recursion limit terminates after O(n), with n being the recursion limit in case of a cycle, the other option require (n(n+1))/2 checks, which scales with O(n^2), n being the size of the cycle + the head leading into it.\nFor small cycles it is faster, no doubt, but any cycle of a size > log recursion_limit would be faster with the implemented variant\n",

    "body": "@skeleten based on [niko's feedback on the other bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/19509#issuecomment-148232320), I'm hesitant to immediately `r+` the strategy here.\n\nIn particular, it sounds to me like @nikomatsakis  thinks the strategy you've used here is too fragile.\n\nYou mentioned that cycle-detection doesn't scale well.  (I assume by that you mean that it adds more overhead to the compilation time compared to this change.) Couldn't we cope with that by starting to do the cycle detection only after we've hit some initial work threshold? I.e., once `autoderefs` hits some fixed threshold (less than the recursion limit), then switch to a different code path that includes cycle detection (restarting the loop if necessary).\n\nThat is, as I understand what others are saying: if you can prove that a cycle actually exists, then it might be sound to cut short the candidate expansion. But in the absence of such proof, continue to error upon hitting the recursion limit?\n\n---\n\nHaving said that, I'm going to ping @nikomatsakis and ask him what he thinks about the options here.\n",

    "body": "The actual performance overhead is very dependent on the `recursion_limit` itself, as well as on the the amount of deref's until a cycle is complete. Of course, both checking the first `n` or the last `n` types is very possible, if we make the `autoderef` function responsible for detecting those changes. I'd suggest treating a cycle \"pretending\" it is the end of the chain, meaning it cannot be `deref`'d any further.\nEDIT: Since the work is greater in the later iterations (as pointed out before, scaling with `O(n)`, since we need to check every type that was dereferenced before) dropping the later checks should be more desireable than the early onces, IMO.\n",
