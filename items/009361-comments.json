    "body": "Hi, thanks for the PR, but I think there are a few problems:\n- `ToStr` is being phased out: it _always_ allocates a string (and possibly several, if it has to call `to_str` on subfields), which is highly suboptimal when one is just dumping that string straight to the OS io routines. This is resolved by the new traits in `std::fmt`, which \"print\" straight to a `Writer` (e.g. write the output straight to stdout).\n- This doesn't offer much over `println!(\"{}\", x)` or `println!(\"{:?}\", x)` for more debugging oriented output.\n\nIn summary, if this was rewritten to use the `std::fmt::Default` trait and `println!(\"{}\", input)` it would have a much higher chance of being accepted, but, even then, it's very likely that it wouldn't accepted.\n",
