If I switch the order, then a lot of code breaks, because in cases like\n\n```\nuse std::usize;\nfn f() -> usize {}\n```\n\nthe name lookup rightfully resolves `usize` as the module `std::usize`, because types and modules share the namespace.\nI'm continuing to study `rustc_resolve` for now to come up with a better solution, but would be glad to recieve any advice.\n",

    "body": "To summarise the status: there is a fix (the issue was fixed not by allowing redefinition but preventing using the names of primitive types as the name of anything user-defined except for modules), however, there were then doubts that this fix may not play well with some of the consequences of UFCS, specifically how primitive types can be used as modules. There does now seem to be consensus that primitive types and their impls and modules are fixed by #23104 and so I don't believe there is anything else to do here.\n",

    "body": "How so? #23104 does not make use of associated constants (#23606 is still not merged yet) so there is a chance things like `u32::MIN` will slightly change in behavior in 1.0.\nWill we have `std::u32` or w/e stuck around forever, as an alias to the type? (allowing beta code to keep working without removing the potentially needless import)\n\nThe names of primitives cannot be considered a fixed set, so I still prefer a solution that explicitly puts them in the prelude - maybe the fix should be modified so it behaves like the primitives are always imported where the prelude would be, even if primitives aren't being rooted in libcore?\n",

    "body": "@eddyb \nI think removing special treatment of primitive types from resolve is still (almost) doable.\nI've tried to prototype the implementation and the main problem is not moving primitive names to the \"prelude-like\" state itself, but backward compatibility :(\n`bool` and `[i/u][8/16/32/64/size]` can be migrated easily (inherent impls can have associated constants), but `f[32/64]`, `char` and `str` have problems.\nModules `f32::consts` and `f64::consts` (http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/f64/#modules) can be emulated by inherent associated types `f32::consts` and `f64::consts` redirecting to actual private types, which in their turn have lots of associated constants. Unfortunately, inherent associated types are not even implemented yet.\nStructs in modules `std::char` and `std::str` (http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/char/#structs, http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/#structs) can be emulated by inherent associated types too, but, again, inherent associated types are not implemented.\n`std::str` is a final boss, it has the trait `FromStr` in it, it will require an associated trait to emulate and I've never even heard about associated traits being discussed.\n\nHow do you think, would it make sense to migrate only part of primitive types to the new name lookup rules and keep the old rules for `str`, `char` etc.?\n\ncc https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/8995\n",
