  "body": "This pull request adds raw socket support to rust using libuv.\n\nSome notes:\n- The native backend is now implemented ~~It only supports the libuv backend - the native backend is stubbed out.~~\n- Tests are not included\n- Documentation follows that of the surrounding code (I can add some if you prefer)\n- Windows does not support raw sockets\n\nUsing raw sockets requires root access on the machine, which I assume the test suite does not have (and will not have) access to. The way around this would be to create a dummy library which exposes all the C functions used without actually implementing the functionality - I don't know how best to go about this or how to integrate it with the test-suite, guidance would be helpful.\n\nI can add support for the native backend if required - there's no reason it can't be there, it just didn't exist while I was writing support. I have tested this on all the platforms I have available to me under various scenarios (transport layer/ipv4/ipv6 and network layer).\n",
