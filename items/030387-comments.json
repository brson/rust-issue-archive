    "body": "In the original context, the `impl` with the not-quite-right lifetimes was in an external crate I didn't write; I eventually figured out what was going on after enough trial-and-error (and I just now got around to filing rust-lang-nursery/regex#143), but it would be nice if the errors could be made clearer.\n\nAlso, the fact that explicitly casting a `&str` to `&str` (at a point in the code that isn't in any of the error messages, even) affects whether there's a type error makes me wonder if something more is going on here \u2014 I can see that it's not conceptually different from needing explicit casts with borrowed/boxed traits, but normally the borrow checker can figure out how to infer them for regions.\n",
