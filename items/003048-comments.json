    "body": "@lkuper thanks for the pointer. I think something has changed, but slightly differently to how I suggested.\n\nThis is my current understanding:\n\nBefore, you could define an iface-less impl on any type and the definition could be in any scope. These impls behaved just like normal impls (that had ifaces).\n\nCurrently, you can define a trait-less impl on any nominal (or pointer-to nominal?) type so long as the definition has to be in the _same_ scope as the type. Going by the error messages I have seen, i am guessing these impls have a different semantics to normal impls - they are somehow \"inherent\" methods that are more attached to the type than regular trait methods are.\n\nMy guess is that methods defined inside class bodies are going to be removed and replaced with trait-less impls defined in the same scope. This would allow defining \"inherent\" methods on enums, something that was not possible before.\n\nI found the previous semantics of iface/trait-less impls really nice. It is no fun to have to define a trait and then directly below it duplicate all the method signatures in the single impl of that trait.\n\nAs a solution to this problem, could inherent methods be defined _only_ within class bodies and enum bodies? Currently you cant defined methods inside enums, but why not? This would allow the trait-less impl syntax to have the semantics that iface-less impls had before.\n",

(See discussion of instance coherence on the development roadmap, and also here.)\n\nPerhaps, but I am hopeful that the trait-less impls (where the trait to implement is kind-of anonymous and is created automatically by declaring the impl - that is how I understood the old iface-less impls) are compatible with the new coherence rules.\n\n> I think you shouldn't have to do that once default methods are allowed in traits, which is a feature that's on the way.\n\nAs I understand if the default/provided methods in a trait would only be allowed to call other (required/provided) methods in that trait, so they are not equivalent to trait-less impls, which can call any methods/functions defined for the type.\n",

But @pcwalton's suggestion, of a combined trait/impl syntax, would.  Maybe it should just look like this (to go back to @Dretch's example):\n\n```\ntrait option_extensions for option<~str> {\n\n    /// if the specified option is some(msg), then fail with msg\n    fn fail_if_some () {\n        for self.each |msg| { fail msg }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nAnd this wouldn't be possible with merely traits + default methods, because parametricity requires that provided methods can only use other provided/required methods.\n\nSo, tentatively changing the title of this bug to \"combined trait/impl syntax\"...\n",
