    "body": "Rust is almost pathologically aggressive here. A name which I never use and where all imports leads to the same type (one a straight re-export of the other) is still sufficient cause to fail the compile, e.g.\n\n```\nuse std::collections::*;\nuse std::collections::hash_map::HashMap;\n```\n\nThis also illustrates that named imports aren't given priority over wildcard imports.\n\nI initially had high hopes for `pub use` because in principle it would allow for the construction of a sane convenient namespace. The current error semantics mean that it's unusable for that purpose because it can't be composed with any other imports without creating conflicts - even when the \"conflicting\" imports are identical to the ones which it is exporting.\n",
