    "body": "I think that we shouldn't take renaming of option methods very lightly any more. Has the transition from `map_default` to `map_or` been discussed and agreed upon?\n\nAlso in the future, I know it's tough and I always forget to do this as well, but it's always nice for reviewing if reorganization of code is separated (by commits) from refactoring/renaming and additions to code. It's tough to see here that the only method on option that changed is `map_default`. I'd be interested in the amount of fallout that the change had, but right now it's all mixed in with the `Result` changes as well.\n\nOther than that though, I like how this pretty much makes the apis of option and result the same. I'm in favor of all the changes to Result, I think that `map_default` may need more discussion though.\n\nI'd r+ a pull request which didn't modify `map_default` though!\n",
