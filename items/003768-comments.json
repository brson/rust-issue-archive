I haven't look at the code, but that seems like it would be fairly easy to do.\n\nEither way, we need to detect or deal cycles, and rather than `fail!`ing I would prefer to see something like `{...}` in the output. It's less ambiguous and doesn't stop the program there and then. We should be encouraging developers to use things like `debug!`, so the runtime equivalent of a tantrum seems counter-productive to that.\n\nHowever, anything is better than stack/memory exhaustion.\n",

There's another approach to the same problem presented by [Adams and Dybvig](http://michaeldadams.org/papers/efficient_equality/) from ICFP 2008, but I don't remember the details of that work.\n",
