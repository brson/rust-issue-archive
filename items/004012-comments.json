    "body": "@glehel A safe pointer-equality operation can definitely be implemented in a moving GC.  One can look for example at how the `eq?` operation is implemented in Scheme runtime systems.\n\nThe place where I would anticipate issues with a moving GC would be unsafe casts from pointers to integers, as one would do e.g. for a pointer-based hashcode operation.  So if one wanted a hashtable based on  memory address that could use `@ptrs` as keys, then that hashtable implementation would need to be tied to the moving GC implementation.  (See e.g. [Larceny's hashtable implementation](https://trac.ccs.neu.edu/trac/larceny/browser/trunk/larceny_src/src/Lib/Common/hashtable.sch?rev=6652#L319) for an example; that is an example of language implementation that takes pains to not allow safe code to extract identify-based hash codes from arbitrary objects, the way that one can in Java via `System.identityHashCode`, though some Scheme systems do not take similar pains)\n",
