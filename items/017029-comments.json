    "body": "I don't understand the rationale for moving `unsafe` static methods to free functions. They are no longer tied to the type and it makes re-exports work poorly because despite having `Vec` in scope you need to use a ridiculously long path to get at them.\n\nWhy go out of the way to make `unsafe` code painful? It already requires an explicit `unsafe` block. It's not like Go where everything needs to be tucked away in an `unsafe` module because there's no explicit boundary.\n\nWhy only do it for static methods? It's just inconsistent and needlessly verbose. The names will collide In a module with more than one collection type (map + set), which is another reason why static methods are useful.\n\nAFAIK, it never went through the RFC process (at least not anything I saw) and goes against the previous consensus that led to converting these from free functions into methods in many modules.\n",

    "body": "@kballard: How do you propose dealing with modules with more than one container type then? Why should static methods be in a module _but not any of the other methods_? They became methods because we made the decision to purge the free functions and a lot of work went into migrating everything. The `unsafe` functions were given the same treatment. Rust relies heavily on re-exports and local `use` statements to avoid writing out enormous paths, and static methods work well in that scheme.\n\nReferring to `Vec::from_buf` is easy, but `std::vec::raw::from_raw_parts` or `collection::vec::raw::from_raw_parts` is not. You can chop off the crate name, but you can't get rid of `vec::raw::` or it becomes ambiguous - and it turns into an extra `use` statement just to get there. Making `unsafe` Rust more verbose does not make it safer, it makes it harder to write and read the code and pushes people away to languages with sugar for low-level code.\n",

I only said it's not a terrible idea, and it's something I would not oppose if it was proposed. But I am not proposing it myself.\n\nIt's a terrible idea because it doesn't work for modules with more than one type like the key-value data structures so it cannot be used consistently. You've avoided addressing that point. No one has given an explanation for the reasoning behind moving the static methods but not the instance methods. I think your point about a clean view of the safe methods was good, but I think it would be fully addressed by adding a filter to rustdoc.\n\n> The only thing that makes this more verbose from a practical perspective is the fact that `Vec` is in the prelude but `std::vec` is not, but I don't think that's a good justification for keeping an _extremely rarely-used_ static function on `Vec`.\n\nThat's not true. It's an extra namespace combined with an extra use statement for anything not in the prelude. There will be a `use` statement the type itself and then `use module_name` in order to have `module_name::raw` instead of `crate::module_name::raw`.\n\n> Better to maintain the precedent already established with the previous `raw` modules (such as `std::str::raw`), especially because this same precedent will presumably apply to other standard library types that may not be in the prelude.\n\nThat's a misrepresentation of the current state of affairs. The vast majority of these `unsafe` functions associated with types are implemented on the types. The `str` module had one or two functions left over that hadn't been migrated to methods. The raw module in `String` and elsewhere + the deprecation of the `unsafe` static methods was done without an RFC very recently and I filed a bug for it.\n\n>  I don't think that's a good justification for keeping an _extremely rarely-used_ static function on `Vec`.\n\nNot all static `unsafe` methods are rarely used. This kind of style decision needs to be applied consistently in order for the API to be easy to learn and navigate so the issue of modules with mutliple types needs to be addressed. IMO, `crate_name::module_name::raw::type_name_foo` is incredibly bad, because the only part you can sanely strip away is `crate_name`. With `crate_name::module_name::TypeName::foo` you can cut it down to `TypeName::foo` just by importing the type, which is likely going to be done _anyway_ to get any the safe static methods and type name easily. The `from_raw_parts` method isn't the only thing at stake here.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger, the convention for \"raw\" operations is a convention under development. The current [mention in the guidelines](http://aturon.github.io/features/functions-and-methods/input.html) isn't as specific as it could be, and I now that @aturon is working on fleshing it out to make it more concrete.\n\nThis PR represents our current understanding of how \"raw\" operations should work, and you bring up some good points that need to be taken into consideration when developing the guideline around operations such as these. Our thinking was something like:\n- Rustdoc _today_ shows these methods with the same prominence as the other constructors, which seems like a bug. This is fixable both at the API level and the rustdoc level.\n- \"Inconvenient access\" to these functions is both desirable and undesirable. If using the function for the first time, you should be aware of the gotchas about it, but if using it for the Nth time you don't want to keep typing the same thing over and over. These two concerns are often at odds with one another.\n- The primary concern for these raw operations is consistency across all APIs, and as @kballard mentioned we're leaning more today towards raw submodules as opposed to top-level methods.\n\nDue to a concrete guideline not currently existing, I may leave these methods in the submodule as `#[unstable]` for now rather than going to `#[stable]` as there are still lingering concerns.\n\n---\n\n@kballard, \n\n> What's the motivation for removing append() and append_one()?\n\nRight now we have a number of \"push some elements onto this vector\" functions, all of which are pretty inconsistent:\n- `push` - takes a value and pushes it onto the receiver.\n- `push_all` - takes a _slice_ and _clones_ values onto the receiver.\n- `push_all_move` - takes a `Vec` and moves the values into the receiver\n- `append_one` - takes _one_ value and pushes it, returning the vector.\n- `append` - takes a _slice_ and _clones_ the values, returning the vector.\n\nSome example inconsistencies:\n- The `_move` suffix is still up for debate whether it's going to stick around, this is one of the very few functions in the standard library that has the suffix.\n- The `append` functions are some of the only functional-style apis for collections in the standard library, they stick out.\n- The `append_one` method has a `_one` suffix, but `push` (the analgous operation) does not.\n- The analagous `push_all` and `append` operations have differing suffixes\n\nWe ended up deciding that there are so many convention questions here that the best thing to do would be to deprecate all of them and start from scratch. I believe that using iterators _can_ be more ergonomic than it is today, and I agree that the current method of \"pushing all by clone\" is a little un-ergonomic. \n\nTo maintain consistence across _all_ collections we need to make sure they all provide similar interfaces (wherever possible). The sugar of \"push all by clone\" only exists for vectors, and we'd also like to extend that option to containers like set, maps, etc.\n\nSo, all in all, we would like to deprecate the functions for now and start afresh. Does that make sense?\n\n---\n\n@thestinger,\n\n> push_all is likely faster too, extend can't trust the size hint to remove bounds checks\n\nThis was indeed considered when deciding what to do about these functions. We figured that these functions are not being removed, and will likely not for awhile, so the performance is not lost for now. If we are unable to come up with a suitable alternative when these functions are slated for deletion, it is likely that some may remain for this concern.\n\n---\n\n@kballard,\n\n> Also, when you're deprecating .to_vec() and .into_vec(), ... How are you proposing to deprecate those?\n\nI've placed the `#[deprecated]` annotations on the implementation for `Vec`. Whether or not the stability attributes pick that up is largely a question for the stability attributes. I believe the trait will stick around now because these are useful methods for slices. When we get to stabilizing the trait we may remove the `into_vec` method, however (just a guess).\n\nDoes that makes sense?\n\n---\n\n@kballard,\n\n> What's the motivation for removing the & in grow()?\n\nThis was a bit of a toss up. The other method in question was `Vec::from_elem` (which took the argument by value), and we wanted to unify the two of these. We ended up deciding that by-value had the possible optimization of actually using the value given for one of the pushes, so we ended up deciding to remove the `&`.\n\nWe couldn't really think of a super-compelling argument in either direction, so we just made a decision.\n\n---\n\n@kballard,\n\n> And the suggested replacement for grow_set() is incorrect\n\nThanks for pointing that out! I'll change it.\n",

    "body": "> and you bring up some good points that need to be taken into consideration when developing the guideline around operations such as these\n\nThat's the problem with making all the decision making behind closed doors. There are many good points (not just from me) that are being missed and then the language has to go through many iterations of breaking changes. The problem with making stability decisions in the dark is that there's _no going back_ after a mistake. There should at least be a cool off period of a week after the last API change before something can be marked `#[stable]`. If it just changed, then it's hardly stable. It could have a terrible flaw that's only discovered after the change is made.\n\n> \"Inconvenient access\" to these functions is both desirable and undesirable.

It's already clear that when using an `unsafe` you need to very carefully read the documentation and consider the consequences. Rust is already more verbose than C++ as a systems language, and intentionally adding verbosity will just mean it loses by a larger margin.\n\nThere are incredibly simple ways to shoot yourself in the foot like `transmute` and raw pointers so there's nothing to gain by going out of the way to make other `unsafe` code painful to use. I can't see why a programming language going out of the way to make your life difficult and your code unreadable is a good thing. Unsafe code is already discouraged by the need to use `unsafe`, and if someone decides they do need it then the standard libraries should make their life as easy as possible. The language needs to make `unsafe` code clean and readable if it's going to compete with C / C++. It's already missing a lot of the sugar.\n\n> This was indeed considered when deciding what to do about these functions.

Writing them up and then proposing them via the RFC process is great, but it currently doesn't really hold any weight. Even though the RFC decisions are made by a small group of people, it's done after people have a venue to give input and criticize. The decision might not be something that most people in the community agree with, but at least it's a very well informed decision.\n\n> This PR represents our current understanding of how \"raw\" operations should work, and you bring up some good points that need to be taken into consideration when developing the guideline around operations such as these.\n\nIt's not the community's understanding of how `unsafe` should work.

As @thestinger says, deprecation means \"this is going away\" and is a very strong encouragement for people to stop using the APIs _immediately_. The only alternatives are a) live with compiler warnings (which sucks, and we definitely don't want to encourage this), or b) disable the warnings (which also sucks, we don't want people to disable deprecation warnings).\n\nStarting from scratch and building a more consistent API is fine. But In the meantime, the functions that are candidates for being replaced _but do not yet have a replacement_ should be `#[unstable]` or `#[experimental]`, not `#[deprecated]`. We can deprecate them once we actually have a replacement. And heck, maybe the new from-scratch API will re-use some of the same function names anyway and so they won't even need to be deprecated.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Yes, I'd recommend keeping the `raw`-related bits as unstable until we go through a formal conventions process for it. I'll try to get that RFC out ASAP. I don't personally have strong feelings about this, other than that we need a clear convention.\n\nAs to `push_all` and friends, I am working on a broad RFC for conventions, stabilization, and some new features for `libcollections` as a whole. This includes specific plans for recovering the ergonomics and performance. I wouldn't say that the plan is to \"start from scratch\" with these APIs, but rather to increase the power and ergonomics of the `Iterator` API so that `extend` covers all use cases. As @alexcrichton says, in the end we can always re-introduce the methods if necessary.\n\nWe were on the fence as to whether to mark these methods as deprecated or experimental. Since our plan is to remove them, deprecation seemed to send the clearest signal, but marking experimental may indeed be the better choice in cases like this (i.e. when the migration is not yet clear.)\n\nAs @alexcrichton explained, `append` and `append_one` are not consistent with any of our other APIs; they are there only by a long historical accident. Removing them may be a slight ergonomic regression in some cases, but we'd much rather have a general way of doing this kind of mutate-and-return-self pattern.\n\nAs a general point, during stabilization we are trying to reduce API surface area where we can, both to minimize the promises we're making and to simplify APIs. For the case of convenience methods, this is sometimes a matter of taste and/or conventions. \n\nWe also want to avoid leaving too much around as `experimental`, lest those APIs become de facto stable.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger \n\n> One person's personal style guidelines isn't the same thing as consensus-based decisions. Writing them up and then proposing them via the RFC process is great, but it currently doesn't really hold any weight. Even though the RFC decisions are made by a small group of people, it's done after people have a venue to give input and criticize. The decision might not be something that most people in the community agree with, but at least it's a very well informed decision.\n\nTo be clear, the guidelines that @alexcrichton cited are not personal -- they are official. In particular, new guidelines for things like `raw` go through the RFC process before ending up in the official guidelines. The current guidelines include a number of this with \"RFC\" status which means they are pending this RFC process and are therefore not yet official. See [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/199) for an example conventions RFC.\n\n> That's the problem with making all the decision making behind closed doors. There are many good points (not just from me) that are being missed and then the language has to go through many iterations of breaking changes. The problem with making stability decisions in the dark is that there's no going back after a mistake. There should at least be a cool off period of a week after the last API change before something can be marked #[stable]. If it just changed, then it's hardly stable. It could have a terrible flaw that's only discovered after the change is made.\n\nWe've been trying to strike a balance between going through the RFC process for conventions issues and making more local API decisions in meetings. The RFC process is lengthy and heavy weight, and we have to balance it against the need to get APIs stabilized leading up to 1.0. Please understand that this is _not_ about a power trip, but rather the simple fact that decisions need to be made in a timely fashion and the resulting process is not always perfect.\n\nThat said, I think the process can certainly be improved and allow for more community input prior to final decisions. (For example, I'm currently writing a large RFC for more general API design around `libcollections`). I will discuss this further with the rest of the core team to see what's feasible balanced against the 1.0 deadline.\n\nAnd thanks @kballard and @thestinger both for your feedback.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger \n\n> inconsistent (everything else is a method)\n\nIf all type constructors that take raw pointers are done as functions in a `raw` module, that's consistent.\n\nI get what you're saying here, but I'm not sure it's really that important to require that all static type constructors be static methods of the type. Note here that we're actually removing `Vec::from_slice()` in favor of just calling `.to_vec()` on the slice; we're losing a static type constructor in favor of a method on another type. That's not that different than losing it in favor of a static function in another module.\n\n> what do you do with multiple types in a module?\n\nUse your best judgement?\n\nI'd actually be in favor of extending associated items to allow modules as well, so you can say `Vec::raw::from_parts()`, although that's probably extremely problematic. In the absence of that, you could just use more descriptive function names. I'd give you an example but I actually can't find any modules that define multiple types and have static type constructors that use raw pointers (e.g. neither `HashMap` nor `HashSet` seem to have any methods that deal with raw pointers).\n\n---\n\nIt occurs to me that we actually could simulate the embedded module thing with the current proposed associated items, by having an associated item that is a static value of a zero-sized type that provides the constructors as methods. The only difference is you'd use `.` instead of `::` before the function. Something like \n\n``` rust\nimpl<T> Vec<T> {\n    pub static raw: VecRawConstructor<T> = VecRawConstructor;\n    // ...\n}\n\nstruct VecRawConstructor<T>;\n\nimpl<T> VecRawConstructor<T> {\n    pub fn from_parts(&self, length: uint, capacity: uint, ptr: *mut T) -> Vec<T> { ... }\n}\n\nfn example_usage() {\n    let (len, cap, ptr) = ...;\n    let v = unsafe { Vec::raw.from_parts(len, cap, ptr) };\n    // ...\n}\n```\n",

    "body": "@aturon I am quite sympathetic to the idea that we should make it easier to user iterators for things like `.push_all()`. However, appending a slice onto a vector seems like really core functionality, and should be a) really obvious how to do it, and b) doable with as little code as possible. Even a hypothetical `vec.extend(slice.iter_clone())` is pushing it a little. I could imagine something like a trait `CloneIterable<T>` with a method `iter_clone()` that's basically equivalent to `iter().map(|x| x.clone())`, because then we could have `fn push_from<I: CloneIterable<T>>(&mut self, source: &I)`. This could then be implemented on `[T]` where `T: Clone`, and we'd get `vec.push_from(slice)`. But it is a bit complicated.\n\nIn any case, while the actual design of these APIs are being hammered out, I think it's really important that we don't use `#[deprecated]` until we actually have a replacement. Using `.extend()` instead of `.push_all()` is a workaround, not a replacement.\n\nPerhaps we need another stability level, something that means \"this is a candidate for deprecation, but we don't have a replacement yet\". This way we can still mark these APIs appropriately without triggering the deprecation warnings. But I personally think `#[experimental = \"candidate for deprecation\"]` is reasonable; APIs marked `#[experimental]` are already subject to being changed later. The only real difference is new APIs introduced as `#[experimental]` are candidates for stabilization, whereas we're talking about APIs that are candidates for deprecation. But I don't know if that difference actually matters in any practical sense.\n",
