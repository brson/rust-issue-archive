The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @steveklabnik (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Thanks @mmcco ! However, we make it an explicit policy to try to compare ourselves to other languages as little as possible in our docs. We do a comparison with C in the introduction, but I believe that's the only place, and I would like to keep it this way. If there's any other places in which we do, I would remove them, rather than add more.\n\nIn light of this, I don't think I can take this patch. I appreciate it though!\n",
