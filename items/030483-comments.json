    "body": "The case where I noticed this is the following:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Pod: Copy { }\n```\n\nThat is,\n- Pod types can always safely be copied,\n- Pod types don't have to be unsized.\n\nBoth statements are true (given the definition of Pod used in lrs, unrelated to the Pod mentioned in the linked issue.) But I had to remove the `Copy` bound because I couldn't implement\n\n``` rust\nimpl<T: Pod> Pod for [T]\n```\n\nwhich is necessary because I want to implement\n\n``` rust\nimpl<T: Pod+?Sized> AsMut<[d8]> for T\n```\n\nThe comment by @nikomatsakis seems to mostly address the cases where you're using `Copy+?Sized` directly, that is, where you care about `Copy`. But in the `AsRef` implementation I only care about the `Pod` aspect.\n\nIt seems that the built-in `Sized` bound can be removed in a backwards compatible way by adding an implicit `Sized` bound in libcore (should already exist via the `Clone` bound). If you then allowed `Copy` to be (explicitly) implemented for slices, the code above would work.\n",

I outlined [some of my thoughts in this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25776#issuecomment-106393457), which @eddyb already linked to. However, in the meantime, I've started to wonder if we should support moving and copying of DSTs just by using allocas at codegen time, which would allow us to make them work much more uniformly, almost like any other type. That would also make it fine for unsized types to be copy, though it might lead to footguns in some cases, but no different than a type like `[u32; 1024]` being `Copy`).",
