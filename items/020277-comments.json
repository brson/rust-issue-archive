The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pcwalton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "So I've added the following pass to the built-in set of lint passes (in `librustc/lint/builtin.rs` and in the body of `register_builtin(...)` in `librustc/lint/context.rs`).\n\n``` rust\nimpl LintPass for ShadowingMacrosPass {\n    fn get_lints(&self) -> LintArray {\n        lint_array!(SHADOWING_MACROS)\n    }\n\n    #[allow(unused_must_use)]\n    fn check_mac(&mut self, cx: &Context, mac: &ast::Mac) {\n        // Pull out the macro identifier out of the definition\n        let ast::MacInvocTT(ref path, _, _) = mac.node;\n        let id: ast::Ident = path.segments.last().unwrap().identifier;\n\n        let id_str = id.name.as_str();\n        io::stderr().write(format!(\"ShadowingMacrosPass#check_mac: {}\\n\", id_str).as_bytes());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**However**, the `check_mac(...)` function seems to never be called. I did some digging and it looks like there are a few places where the compiler is skipping [macro](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/84f5ad8679c7fc454473ffbf389030f3e5fee379/src/libsyntax/visit.rs#L119-L126) [visiting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d2368c3c11ddab9d812c4ddec2e44579326ad347/src/librustc_trans/save/mod.rs#L1396-L1398); could those be possible culprits for why `check_mac` is being skipped over, or have I just done something dump somewhere?\n",
