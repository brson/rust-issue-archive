  "body": "Closes #1433. Implemented after suggestion by @cmr in #12323\n\nThis is slightly less flexible than the implementation in #12323 (binary and octal floats aren't supported, nor are underscores in the literal), but is cleaner in that it doesn't modify the core grammar, or require odd syntax for the number itself. The missing features could be added back with relatively little effort (the main awkwardness is parsing the string. Is there a good approach for this in the stdlib currently?)\n",
