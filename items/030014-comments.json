I think we could reasonably call it a contract violation, but what are the downsides of returning an error? One potential use case where an error might be more helpful is if the open options were constructed based on some other input (perhaps it was provided by or derived from a user). If the final call panic'd when the options were nonsense, I'd feel obligated to implement my own logic to ensure the options weren't nonsense. If however it returned an error, I might just rely on that instead, which does seem a bit more convenient.\n",
