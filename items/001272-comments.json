Those aren't available at compile time, so if you say `const x: int = std::int::max_value - 1;`, the const will have to be filled in during initialization.\n\n(Or we could just grab the current value from the `.so`, but that seems fragile.)\n",

    "body": "I think the crate-external part can probably block on figuring out how we're going to do cross-crate inlining. It's the same issue. If you export a constant as \"inline\" you should be able to use it in another crate as part of another const; the value gets copied across at compile time. Otherwise not.\n\n(aside: it is sometimes held among language designers that inline-ness should be declared at the call site not the definition-side; if we go down that road then \"const x = external::foo\" could well count as an inline-requiring-use. or require some kind of expression-form declaration like \"const x = inline(external::foo) + 1\")\n",
