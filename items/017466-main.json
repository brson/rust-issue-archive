  "body": "Moves the vast majority of builtin bound checking out of type contents and into the trait system.\n\nThis is a preliminary step for a lot of follow-on work:\n- opt-in builtin types, obviously\n- generalized where clauses, because TypeContents has this notion that a type parameter has a single set of builtin kinds, but with where clauses it depends on context\n- generalized coherence, because this adds support for recursive trait selection\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to completely remove Type Contents from the front-end checking in this PR. It's still used by EUV to decide what gets moved and what doesn't.\n\nr? @pcwalton \n",
