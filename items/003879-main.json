  "body": "This is a pull request to implement @graydon 's suggestion, way back in #1458, of preserving parenthesization in the AST.\n\nI have the feeling that WRT trans and typeck, there could be fewer explicit special cases for `expr_paren`. This has something to do with the `adjustments` table in the type context, and I don't entirely understand how it works. At any rate, this passes tests. Suggestions welcome.\n\nUnfortunately, the test from #1458 still doesn't work, for apparently-separate reasons.\n\nr? @graydon\n",
