    "body": "The thing is that what @erickt is _really_ asking for here is not exactly overloading.  Instead, the use of overloaded bounds was kind of a workaround for the inability to say something like \"a type T that is serializable by any serializer\".  \n\nActually, the best answer (at least at the moment) for this _specific_ scenario is to use a trait type.  I don't believe the Serializable interface refers to the `self` type, therefore one could write:\n\n```\nfn print2<\n    S1: Serializer,\n    S2: Serializer,\n    T: Serializable<@Serializer>\n>(t: T, s1: @S1, s2: @S2) {\n    t.serialize(s1 as @Serializer);\n    io::println(\"\");\n\n    t.serialize(s2 as @Serializer);\n    io::println(\"\");\n}\n```\n\nHere I've rephrased the example in terms of `@` rather than `&` merely because this is closer to being implemented today.  You can could do the same thing with `&S1`, `&S2`, and `&Serializer` once we implement that properly.\n\nIn any case, I'm going to close, because I don't expect we'll fix this case.\n",
