    "body": "I\u2019m working on this, but I think we still need to further clarify what counts as a help message rather than a note. If something directly suggests the user to do something (e.g., `use `ref` to override`), I think that definitely qualifies as a help message. If something just adds information to an error (e.g., `reference must be valid for the block at 1:10`), it should clearly be a note. But sometimes it\u2019s not so easy to tell. Messages like ``type` aliases cannot be used for traits` _explain_ an error, but they don\u2019t suggest what to do. So should they be notes or help messages? On one hand, it makes sense for them to be help messages, as they _help_ the user understand the main error message, but on the other hand, they are in a way part of the error. In a message like `expected `;`, found `{``, it would be strange to separate the `expected `;`` part into a help message, but it does only provide extra helpful information to explain the error.\n",
