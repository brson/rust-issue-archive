    "body": "The \"the type of this value must be known in this context\" error comes from the `typeck::check::structurally_resolved_type()` function. `structurally_resolved_type()` is supposed to take a type and return a one-level-resolved version of it.  Right now, it will do that or die trying.  If we just make this a non-fatal error, then `structurally_resolved_type()` will have no choice but to return the original type with unresolved type variables, and let other code deal with the consequences.\n\nIn particular, this means that in code like `compile-fail/issue-2151.rs`, where we currently just get\n\n```\n/home/lkuper/rust/src/test/compile-fail/issue-2151.rs:3:20: 3:21 error: the type of this value must be known in this context\n/home/lkuper/rust/src/test/compile-fail/issue-2151.rs:3         log (debug, i * 2);\n                                                                            ^\n```\n\nwe'd instead get\n\n```\n/home/lkuper/rust/src/test/compile-fail/issue-2151.rs:3:20: 3:21 error: the type of this value must be known in this context\n/home/lkuper/rust/src/test/compile-fail/issue-2151.rs:3         log (debug, i * 2);\n                                                                            ^\n/home/lkuper/rust/src/test/compile-fail/issue-2151.rs:3:20: 3:25 error: binary operation * cannot be applied to type `<V1>`\n/home/lkuper/rust/src/test/compile-fail/issue-2151.rs:3         log (debug, i * 2);\n                                                                            ^~~~~\n```\n\nA similar thing happens in `compile-fail/issue-2150.rs` and in `compile-fail/issue-2149.rs`.  In all three cases, after the \"type of this value must be known\" error, we reach another error that's essentially a more specific version of it.  Is this an improvement?  Specificity = probably good, duplicate errors = meh, having to print type variables = probably bad...\n",
