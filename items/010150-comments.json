    "body": "Why were all of the three-tilde blocks migrated to four tildes? Did it not render correctly?\n\nAlso, I don't think that this is the right fix for the js searching, this is indicative of a bug in rustdoc, not a bug in the js search code. I'm not sure why parents are being emitted with no entries in the global array, privacy pruning should have gotten rid of everything. I'd want to understand what's  causing the root of the problem rather than patching over it.\n",

    "body": "That was just to normalize (in the doc there are stacks of 3 tildes, 4 tildes... on Windows at least tildes are emitted 2-by-2 so its easier with 4).\nYea I know it's more of a hack than a fix but search works ok again with that change. Well I'll just close this then.\n",
