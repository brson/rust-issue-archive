    "body": "hey @steveklabnik I wonder if you could provide some input on something.\n\nI was going through the pointers guide and I think there are lots of overlapping concepts. I'm starting to think that merging both guides would make sense.\n\nAlso, in the pointers guide, I believe there's an important mix of concepts that could be confusing. Again, since pointers != references, I don't think the guide is using the correct wording. Note that the ideas behind it are correct.\n\nThanks : )\n",
