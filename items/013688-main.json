  "body": "This adds experimental support for timeouts when accepting sockets through\n`TcpAcceptor::accept`. This does not add a separate `accept_timeout` function,\nbut rather it adds a `set_timeout` function instead. This second function is\nintended to be used as a hard deadline after which all accepts will never block\nand fail immediately.\n\nThis idea was derived from Go's SetDeadline() methods. We do not currently have\na robust time abstraction in the standard library, so I opted to have the\nargument be a relative time in millseconds into the future. I believe a more\nappropriate argument type is an absolute time, but this concept does not exist\nyet (this is also why the function is marked #[experimental]).\n\nThe native support is built on select(), similarly to connect_timeout(), and the\ngreen support is based on channel select and a timer.\n\ncc #13523\n",
