    "body": "I'm not sure I understand the use case for `lli` here.  You can't take bytecode from `rustc` that thinks it's targetting one platform and then compile/run it on another platform.  `size_of::<int>()` and processing of `#[cfg]` directives will be wrong, for example.  It may work in some limited cases but it's not really a safe or reasonable thing to do.\n\nSince you need to compile things differently for host vs. target, you might as well use the normal compilation path for both.\n",

    "body": "> It would be a better solution to build and install a rust-lli along with the compiler, at least until Rust can depend on a reasonably old stable version of the upstream LLVM.\n\nThis is already supported via the `--llvm-root` parameter for `configure`. The only things in Rust's fork of LLVM are a compile-time optimization and a `NullCheckElimination` pass. Both could probably be pushed upstream anyway.\n",
