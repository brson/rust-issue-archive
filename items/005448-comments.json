    "body": "I'm fairly confused about pointers in Rust generally, but putting `@` and `mut` everywhere seemed to make things compile.\n\nI'm trying to write a Bitmapped Vector Trie. This means having a bunch of size 32 arrays of pointers. I wanted to be able to express that the array will always be size 32, so I used the `[@A * 32]` notation in the `Level1` type. However, I'm not sure how to make a `[@int * 32]` when I don't actually care about the values yet.\n\nI wanted it make it a more functional style data structure (with immutability/structure sharing), but that seemed to be making my pointer-lifetime compiler errors worse, so I'm currently (well, attempting) to use a `@mut [@A * 32]` to hold the data. I think this means that I have a managed array on the local heap containing 32 managed pointers, and that I can change any of the 32 pointers in the array. The current challenge is making an instance of that type, where I don't actually care about the values.\n",
