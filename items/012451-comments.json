    "body": "I'm inclined to agree with @huonw here: As his example illustrates, a macro can expand into a `fn` that binds a lifetime.  This leads me to think that lifetimes should respect hygiene.  (I guess I mention this only because huon has already said that macros-expanding into methods are a potential future motivation, but I would think that the current motivations are sufficient.)\n\nI do not understand the motivation outlined in the description on #7743: \"This will allow them to be safely compared without fear of runtime-fail.\"  Is this just talking about when writing `rustc` internal code?  Or writing macro expanders?\n\nIn any case I'd prefer runtime-fail over having active footguns that are hidden by lack of hygiene.\n\n@jbclements can you elaborate?\n",
