    "body": "> - Rename `to_byte` to `as_byte`\n> - Rename `to_char` to `as_char`\n\n`.as_*` methods are generally used when converting types without changing the in-memory representation. For example, `String.as_bytes()` gives a `&[u8]` that refers to the underlying memory of the `String`. Whereas `.to_*` methods are used for conversions that may allocate and/or copy data.\n\nIt's not so obvious what's correct when talking about these small primitive values, as all conversion is cheap, but `.to_*` is still technically the correct naming for `.to_char()`, as it does copy data to a new memory representation (even if it doesn't allocate data).\n\nFor `.to_byte()` it's less clear, because `Ascii` actually is a `u8` under the hood, but that's really an implementation detail. There have been proposals to allow integral types of all widths instead of just 8/16/32/64, and if we ever do that `Ascii` would be a `u7` instead. But ignoring that for a sec, arguments can be made for both `.to_byte()` and `.as_byte()`, and since there's no clear winner, and we already have `.to_byte()` (and it's consistent with `.to_char()`) my recommendation is to avoid the breaking change and just leave it as `.to_byte()`.\n",

    "body": "@aochagavia The only reason to use a trait instead of just implementing the same methods is if you want to be generic over the trait. `Char` exists right now just because you can't impl methods on `char` directly. Personally, I don't see that there's a need for a trait to unify this, because I don't think it's very likely that you'll need a function that's generic over both `char` and `Ascii` using just these functions, but if you do want to use a trait, then we may as well use the one we already have.\n\nLooking at it, the only methods that I'm guessing you don't think make sense are `len_utf8_bytes()`, `encode_utf8()`, and `encode_utf16()` (note that the two `escape` methods actually do make sense for `Ascii`). But if you're going to be generic over a trait, being able to encode the value as UTF-8/UTF-16 actually seems like a reasonable thing to want, so I don't see the problem with providing this functionality for `Ascii`.\n",

    "body": "@aochagavia I'm on board with implementing the changes myself. Just to clarify, this is what you want to do:\n- Split `char::Char` into two traits, one of them being `char::CharType` (or maybe `CharClassify`?)\n- Implement `CharType` (or `CharClassify`) on `Ascii`\n- Deprecate `Ascii.eq_ignore_case`\n\nAnything else that I'm missing? I think we should probably also go ahead and remove `.to_ascii()` in favor of `.to_ascii_opt()`, as you had suggested.\n\nAlso, opinion on `is_digit_radix()`? Does it make sense to put it in `CharType`, because it's potentially useful, or leave it out because it doesn't correspond to one of the common character classes?\n",

    "body": "@kballard No problem, go ahead!\n\nActually I would like the `Char` trait to be implemented by both `char` and `Ascii`, and a new `Utf8Char` trait implemented only by `char`. However, I guess your suggestion of a `CharType` trait will be good as well. My only concern here is naming, because `CharType` seems redundant and `CharClassify` doesn't convince me (the functions you implement are not only used to classify chars).\n\nAdditionaly, I think it would be good to have `is_digit_radix()`. If you have it, then you can define `is_digit()` and `is_hex()` in terms of it. This way you would only need to implement one function, and you would get the other two for free.\n\nAnother concern I have is the fact that `is_digit_radix()` will fail if the radix is greater than 36. The problem here is that it could be confusing to return `None` because it would look like the character is not a digit, while the real problem is that the radix is invalid. IMO returning a `Result` would complicate things too much, so I think that we should keep failing (I can't see a better alternative). If you can find any better solution for this, please add it to your pr.\n",
