    "body": "I posted [a related issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32824) earlier, but @mitaa kindly pointed me here, so I'll close that in favour of posting the parts of my issue that have not been covered here yet below.\n\nIn examples like the one above this normally isn't a huge issue as it is possible to `pub use Foo as Loz` instead, which accomplishes the same thing in practise.\n\nHowever, in practise I often come across cases where `pub use` does not suffice. The most pressing use-case I've come across is when `Foo` has a type parameter, and I want to create an alias of `Foo` with the type parameter filled, i.e.\n\n``` rust\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub enum Foo<T> { Bar(T), Baz }\npub type Loz = Foo<i32>;\n\npub fn qux() -> Loz {\n    Loz::Bar(0) // error\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", qux());\n}\n```\n\n[_playpen_](http://is.gd/2VfPrL)\n\nHere I want to expose `Loz` from my API as if it were a `Foo<i32>` when it comes to its use as a type as well as variant access. Doing a type alias (as above) allows for using `Loz` in signatures without issues (see the `fn qux` signature) however I cannot access the variants using `Loz`, meaning I would have to _also_ require a user to import `Foo` in case they wish to access variants. Alternatively, if I instead `pub use foo::Foo as Loz` I can now access variants using `Loz` without issue, however the type parameter is no longer filled, meaning the `fn qux` signature no longer works and I'm unable to express through my API that `Loz` should always be `Foo<i32>` and not `Foo<T>`.\n",
