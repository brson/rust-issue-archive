The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pnkfelix (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the PR @SimonSapin! I like the reduction in API surface area here, and I think that this can actually go even farther and remove the lossy decoder (as it's just a simple `.map(...)` iterator anyway). I'm not 100% certain that this is an API we'd want to expose as stable at some point (we have little precedent for iterator constructors today), but I have no outstanding issue with the API as-is.\n\nCould you leave behind the old support, but mark it all as `#[deprecated]`? (to help ease current users on nightly).\n",

    "body": "- Added deprecated wrappers for the old API\n- Removed the lossy decoder\n- Added a `std::char::REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER` const instead, and documented how to do lossy decoding with it.\n- Moved `Utf16Decoder::new` to `Iterator::decode_utf16`, which seems more idiomatic for iterator adaptors. That moves it to libcore and (indirectly) into the prelude, but then that is already the case for `char::encode_utf16`. It\u2019s also the first `Iterator` method that only works with one concrete `Iterator::Item` type.\n\nI\u2019m not so sure about that last change. What do you think?\n",

I also generalized `u16` to `Borrow<u16>` (moving `Borrow` to libcore) and (in the constructor function) `Iterator` to `IntoIterator`. This allows using a `&[u16]` slice directly, like before.\n",

    "body": "`Borrow<u16>` is used here as a way to express \u201c`u16` or `&u16`\u201d. The former is the most general case, `&u16` doesn\u2019t work if you\u2019re generating `u16`\u2019s incrementally without allocating buffers. The latter, when combined with `IntoIterator`, conveniently allows passing a `&[u16]` slice directly.\n\nI don\u2019t care so much about generalizing `&u16` to other kinds of references.\n\nIf you feel this is too much magic I can reverse to just `u16`, but `decode_utf16(slice)` would have to be more verbose: `decode_utf16(slice.iter().cloned())`.\n",
