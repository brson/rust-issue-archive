    "body": "I think this is due to the fact that for loops are no longer desugar into match code with a loop. It is peculiar but probably harmless. What happens is that the iterator yields up refs of lifetime `'a`, so in the original code `x` has type `&'a A`, but there is no rule that says that `A:'a` (actually I think we ought to infer that from the trait bound on `I`, but we do not currently do so). Adding the bound explicitly resolves that, as you said.\n\nIn the rewritten code, `&ref x` causes the lifetime of `x` to be inferred separately, and yields a shorter lifetime that is local to the loop (let's call it `'loop`). Hence the type of `x` is `&'loop A`. The compiler always assumes that type arguments outlive the function body itself, so `A:'loop` is considered to be true. \n\nHowever, in principle the for loop ought to check that the type that the pattern is matching _against_ is also well-formed. If the code were written out using a `match`, for example, this check would occur. \n",
