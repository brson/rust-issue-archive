    "body": "Some additional notes:\n\n(1) As the discussions in #15628 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1054 imply, it's not at all clear that this really belongs in the standard library, since it's a sensible default but not an all-encompassing standard for word breaking. So this PR should really be treated as a trial balloon to answer one implicit question in that conversation, namely, what does the corresponding code actually look like?\n\n(2) I realize that `split_words_uax29()` and `words_unicode()` seem to be inconsistent in their naming.\n\nMy reasoning is this: the name `split_words_uax29()` refers to the precise concept presented in UAX#29. On the other hand, the name `words_unicode()` is intended to be a more general description of what the function is doing.\n\nI don't like the name `words_uax29()` because it exposes too much nerdy detail to the user; on the other hand, `split_words_unicode()` is a bit vague.\n\nOne possibility is to just get rid of `words_unicode()` entirely. Equivalent functionality is obtainable with `s.split_words_uax29().filter(|s| s.any(|c| c.is_alphanumeric()))`. But it's nice to have short names for things, provided those things are used frequently enough. I don't have a good sense of whether `words_unicode()` hits the bar for \"frequently enough,\" though.\n",

Also, like @SimonSapin, I agree that the standard library is probably not the best place for this right now.\n\nWould you be interested in a crate on crates.io which implemented this infrastructure? For now it could start out with the methods as implemented and implementations of the `Pattern` trait could be behind an Cargo feature to allow it to build on stable Rust for now.\n",

    "body": "Sure, moving this to crates.io seems very reasonable.\n\nI can imagine two possible approaches. One is to make this new crate a general `unicode` library, with the aim of eventually providing a subset of `libicu`'s functionality (not already covered by other crates, e.g., `time`, `regex`, `encoding`, etc.). In this case, we would relocate as much of the unstable functionality of the current `libunicode` as possible (leaving behind only what the compiler needs and renaming the library, say, `libunicode_minimal`). The removed portion would probably include character width, normalizations, etc.\n\nThe other possibility is to call the new crate `uax29` (or `unicode_uax29`) and only implement the UAX#29-related features there. In this case, we should still consider moving the `Graphemes` iterators as well (and implementing corresponding `Pattern`s there, one assumes).\n\nAlso: I suppose this serves to answer #15628 (if this doesn't go in `std` then `words()` certainly can't be UAX#29).\n",
