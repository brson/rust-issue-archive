    "body": "@brson: Well, my opinion is that there's not a need to define a default, in which case it wouldn't have a place in std. I do think it's important for it to be equal to fixed-size integers or people are going to choose the convenience of ignoring overflow. That's already the culture Rust has created because for fast big integers you need to go out of your way to use `rust-gmp` and they're a pain to initialize.\n",

    "body": "Since there was a discussion between myself and @thestinger on IRC, it might be useful to summarise my point.\n\nIf Rust included anything (L)GPL in the stdlib, it would make it unusable for many closed-source software developers. It would effectively kill Rust for game dev and possibly also for iOS/Mac store/Windows Store.\n\nI do agree that there should be a low barrier to using bigints. Perhaps the solution is an official (curated) list of libraries that are not necessarily endorsed, but considered of good quality, as @thestinger suggested. Then it would be obvious how to do bigints in Rust (GMP, libtommath or intel's, depending on which license you prefer) without having to include anything in the stdlib.\n",
