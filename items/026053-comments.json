    "body": "As @jdm mentioned, you'll want to ensure that the function is marked with `extern` (the `\"C\"` is optional) to ensure that the ABI matches what node.js expects. You'll also want to be sure it's `pub` to make sure it's exported from the DLL, and finally you'll want to add the `#[no_mangle]` attribute to ensure that the symbol isn't mangled (e.g. it's actually called `process`). After that it should be good to go!\n",
