    "body": "@graydon had some reservations about this. He is concerned that people should know whether they are getting task-local data or thread-local data. I don't think of it like that though - more as 'language-local' data. The language itself and a number of tightly integrated services expect access to 'local' things. This has always meant task-local in the past, but I am trying to make the required runtime as minimal as possible, primarily by factoring out these services in a way that they can be accessible without tasks. One of them is task-local data.\n\nIt's possible that task-local data is not one of these requires services though (it's not as important as the heap) and could _only_ be accessible from inside a task. We could also expose the API through two different paths so that you have to specify which one you want. We wouldn't do that for other local services though, e.g. `fail!()`, `log!()`.\n",
