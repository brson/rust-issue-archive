    "body": "> The \"experimental\" lint is now allow by default. This is because\n> almost all existing crates have been marked \"experimental\", pending\n> library stabilization. With inheritance in place, this would generate\n> a massive explosion of warnings for every Rust program.\n\nWould it be possible to having it on `warn` by default, but only warn on the actual `extern crate ...;` declaration. That is,\n\n``` rust\nextern crate core; // warning: use of experimental crate\n\nfn main() {\n     core::iter::Repeat::new(1); // no warning\n}\n```\n\nI imagine this kinda goes against the whole inheritance thing. Maybe the warning should only be on the \"top-level\"/first use of names with an explicit stability level, i.e. `use foo::experimental_module;` warns, but then writing `experimental_item::bar()` later doesn't warn (unless `bar` has its own explicit marking).\n\nThis would require warning on things like `::stable_crate::experimental_module::bar()`.\n",

    "body": "@huonw @brson \n\nRunning stage2 `time-passes` on `librustc`:\n- New stability index AST pass: 0.045s\n- Lint in master: 0.551s\n- Lint in branch: 0.360s\n\nThese numbers are consistent across multiple runs.\n\nSo I think my `time` experiment before was just too noisy, and the new stability indexing code appears to be _faster_. Perhaps that's not surprising, since it's using fast hashmap lookups during the lint.\n",
