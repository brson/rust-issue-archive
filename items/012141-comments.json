It is precisely that reddit post that led me to try to pull this out.\n\nFrom my point-of-view, making the bigint a separate crate _should_ make it easier for an end-developer to swap-in a GMP based implementation.\n\nMore importantly, the separate crate makes it far far easier to quickly iterate through performance improvements, like the one I linked above on `pidigits`.  (And I'm sure there's a lot of more low-hanging fruit here -- but its only low-hanging if we can iterate quickly.)\n",

It may or may not make the builds faster, but it doesn't make it any less official or harder to use. If anything, it makes it _more_ discoverable because there's a whole crate for it rather than it being tucked away in extra. I doubt it will have competitive performance for years, so why present it as the best Rust can do by having it part of the official Rust distribution?\n\nIt's easier to iterate on it in an independent repository no tied at _all_ to Rust's build system, and not requiring a whole clone of the Rust repository to avoid unnecessary rebuilds when switching between branches. It's currently not a very a useful library...\n",

    "body": "@thestinger I'm not trying to make the builds of the standard library faster.  I'm trying to make it easier for everyone to collectively improve the `bigint` library.\n\nAs for the question of how easy we can/should make it to swap in the GMP library (the limit of this line-of-thinking being that GMP becomes the default, and one would have to _opt-out_ of using it), _that_ seems totally orthogonal to the change suggested by this ticket.  Am I missing something?\n\n(update: this comment was in response to an earlier draft of thestinger's previous comment that made no mention of separate repositories.  Github based dialogues are such fun...)\n",

If we don't want people to infer their opinion of Rust from this library, then it shouldn't be part of the official Rust distribution before the embarrassing performance issues are fixed. No one is going to lose out by this being out of the official repository because it's not yet a useful library.\n",
