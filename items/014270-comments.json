    "body": "The issue with `Vec<&mut int>` is one I hadn't considered before, and is rather unfortunate. `&uniq` could be leveraged in some fashion to try and fix this, but of course we were hoping to remove `&uniq` with by-value closures.\n\nTheoretically, borrowck could try and track whether a `&` reference is actually non-aliased, where a non-aliased `&` reference is one derived from something else known to be non-aliased (such as a non-borrowed local variable), or derived from an existing non-aliased `&` reference (including being returned from a function that declares it as having the same lifetime as the non-aliased `&` parameter). It would have to be able to \"downgrade\" a non-aliased `&` to a regular `&` as well, if the local variable or any \"parent\" reference is accessed while the non-aliased `&` is still alive. This would allow `*v.get(0) = 2` to work without any changes to the libraries or user code, and similarly should allow `Box<&mut T>` to work, but is rather complex.\n\nA more limited suggestion would be to have borrowck merely consider the results of `Deref<T>` to be non-aliased if the dereferenced value is known to be non-aliased. `deref()` returns a `&`-reference but that reference is hidden from the client code. A separate attribute can be used to declare that a smart pointer is considered unique, and the two combined would allow `Box<&mut T>` to be implemented fully in the library. But this approach doesn't fix `Vec<&mut T>`.\n",

    "body": "@huonw `mut` doesn't replicate current behavior:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut a = 3i;\n    let b = box &mut a;\n    let c = &b;\n    **b = 4i;\n    println!(\"{}\", c);\n}\n```\n\nNote that I can still assign to `**b` despite having an outstanding borrow on `b`.\n\nMore importantly, you can't say `let m = &mut **b;` due to the outstanding immutable borrow of `b`, which means that taking a `&mut` reference is not equivalent to the ability to modify the box.\n\nThe question is, is the current behavior worth keeping, or can all clients of the current behavior be made to work with `mut` and `&mut` just as well?\n\n---\n\nAlso I'm mildly concerned about the fact that I can mutate the boxed `&mut T` despite having an outstanding immutable reference to the box. Is there any aliasing issues here? I'm guessing no, because the reference I have points to the unique pointer, and the unique pointer is what I mutated through, so reading the value through the reference does ultimately read through the same pointer used to mutate, but I don't have a complete understanding of LLVM's data dependency aliasing rules.\n",

    "body": "I know that this has already had a nomination removed once before, but I'm renominating because I think the reasoning given was hasty. It _is_ still a backcompat hazard to some degree, because if we ever want to move `Box` into a library, which everyone seems to desire, it will then tie our hands and require us to first implement certain features solely for the sake of maintaining backcompat.\n\nIn the meantime, we could free ourselves of that obligation by restricting the behavior of `Box` to only what the existing language semantics permit for user-defined types. The functionality that exists today could be added backwards-compatibly in the future _if_ we decide to implement the needed features.\n\nIt's fine if you want to immediately remove this nomination, just please acknowledge that it effectively amounts to a binding promise regarding future features that will be added to the language.\n",

    "body": "I\u2019d like to bring up [RFC 130](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0130-box-not-special.md), which removes some special casing of `Box` in the borrow checker for backward-compatibility reasons. That RFC was accepted, and aims to solve the same issue that this one does. I would not expect fixing this issue to break much code at all\u2014`Box<&mut int>` is probably not used very often, and it\u2019s easy to fix, anyway. So I think it makes sense to resolve this issue before 1.0: it\u2019s a fairly minor change, and it\u2019s part of an existing attempt to make it backwards-compatible to move `Box` out of the language post-1.0. The way I see it, we have three options:\n1. Keep this behaviour as it is right now, and add some new mechanism (probably `&uniq`) that might be a major addition to the language post-1.0 to make moving `Box` out of the library backwards-compatible;\n2. Make a relatively minor change to the language now (disallow mutating the `T` in any `Box<&mut T>` when the `Box` is in an immutable slot), and possibly add a generalised way of doing the same thing for library types post-1.0;\n3. Never move `Box` out of the library until the next breaking release, which could be years away. I hope this doesn\u2019t happen.\n",
