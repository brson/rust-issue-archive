    "body": "I agree that the CSS rule seems like it should work fine.  I uninstalled \"Fira\" to troubleshoot this further.  You mentioned that the font should be downloaded which made me realize I should check NoScript, but it doesn't show any blocked resources...  So just to be extra safe I disabled ALL extensions but I'm still getting invisible text.  So here is a screen shot of my \"Network\" tab with all extensions disabled after a hard refresh:\n\n![network-tab](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/618839/5161368/3f4f2566-7364-11e4-92e4-48d31560c1b5.jpg)\n\nJust to be thorough I tried this from Google Chrome but that displays the page without text as well.  I even tried changing my GTK+ and Firefox themes in case it was just inheriting some white text rule from there, but it didn't have any effect.  Just incase you want an example of 3rd-party documentation with similar issues here's a screenshot from https://hyperium.github.io/hyper/hyper/index.html with the networking tab open (Note that the SourceSerifPro-Regular font seems to download and display fine):\n\n![hyper-docs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/618839/5161447/56383c3e-7366-11e4-9e2f-2a137ea4673d.jpg)\n\nAnd with the CSS rule mentioning \"Fira\" disabled:\n\n![hyper-fira-disabled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/618839/5161454/63512df4-7366-11e4-9d42-10f386738453.jpg)\n",

    "body": "I can confirm this problem in Chrome as well as Firefox when I don't have the Fira Sans fonts installed. \nAlso, I don't have `@font-face` disabled.\nI think the bigger problem arising from this is that `rustdoc` documentation won't show up properly without having these fonts, making `rustdoc` somewhat problematic within intranets etc. \nFunnily enough, on mobile Chrome (Android 5.0), it works fine, which would suggest that the mobile CSS is written correctly, because Android doesn't have Fira Sans and so the fallback kicks in as it should. \nMaybe comparing the mobile/desktop css in the relevant sections will provide some leads. \n",
