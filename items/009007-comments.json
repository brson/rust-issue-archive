    "body": "fwiw, I'm in favor of the traits getting merged. I'm also generally not a fan of having lots and lots of traits, but that's more of just a general guideline that I try to follow.\n\nIn this specific case I don't think that it really makes a lot of sense to have one trait per type when it actually fits pretty well to encompass both types at the same time. Things may be separate now between Uint and Int, but I'm always a fan of unifying if possible for clarity and reduction of surface area. Just my opinions though :)\n",
