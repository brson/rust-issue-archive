  "body": "With the addition of separate search paths to the compiler, it was intended that\napplications such as Cargo could require a `--extern` flag per `extern crate`\ndirective in the source. The system can currently be subverted, however, due to\nthe `existing_match()` logic in the crate loader.\n\nWhen loading crates we first attempt to match an `extern crate` directive\nagainst all previously loaded crates to avoid reading metadata twice. This \"hit\nthe cache if possible\" step was erroneously leaking crates across the search\npath boundaries, however. For example:\n\n```\nextern crate b;\nextern crate a;\n```\n\nIf `b` depends on `a`, then it will load crate `a` when the `extern crate b`\ndirective is being processed. When the compiler reaches `extern crate a` it will\nuse the previously loaded version no matter what. If the compiler was not\ninvoked with `-L crate=path/to/a`, it will still succeed.\n\nThis behavior is allowing `extern crate` declarations in Cargo without a\ncorresponding declaration in the manifest of a dependency, which is considered\na bug.\n\nThis commit fixes this problem by keeping track of the origin search path for a\ncrate. Crates loaded from the dependency search path are not candidates for\ncrates which are loaded from the crate search path.\n",
