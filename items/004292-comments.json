    "body": "Regarding ARC's get() function, yes, I meant to replace that with a method but never got around to it. Same for clone() and unwrap().\n\nAs for MutexARC, I'm of split minds. I called it \"access\" to contrast with the read/write functionality of RWARC -- no matter what you're doing with the data in a MutexARC, the lock is held in the same mode, whereas with RWARC, readers can read simultaneously. And MutexARC is unsafe, whereas RWARC is safe, so on one hand I'd say if you need different read and write functionality you should be using RWARC instead.\n\nOn the other hand, the reason MutexARC is unsafe is to allow for nesting more ARCs inside of them, which RWARCs can't do. So adding a read() function to MutexARC would allow constructing, e.g., a LinearMap in an ARC that stores more ARCs inside of it, which would be crazy, but also awesome.\n\nAnyway, if MutexARC gains a read function, make sure the documentation stresses that it's not there for parallelism.\n",

MutexARC incurs a lot of runtime overhead (constant-time, but several pipe reads and writes) doing synchronisation, compared to ARC, which needs none at all. Instead, convert your data structure to have no mutable interior fields, and you can use ARC.\n",
