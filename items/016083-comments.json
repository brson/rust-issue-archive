    "body": "Adding explicit lifetimes like `fn quux<'a>(_: &'a str) -> &'a str { \"quux\" }` works fine too (i.e. this isn't caused by lifetime elision).\n\nThe reason it all works is `'static` is a super-lifetime of every lifetime, i.e. `&'static str` is also a `&'a str` for any `'a`, because `'static` data is guaranteed to live for `'a` (including a elided/anonymous lifetime). This behaviour can be quite useful, when sometimes you wish to return something out of an argument, and sometimes some fixed string, e.g.\n\n``` rust\nfn f<'a>(x: &'a Option<String>) -> &'a str {\n     match *x {\n         Some(ref s) => s.as_slice(),\n         None => \"<none>\"\n     }\n}\n```\n\nChanging this would also affect traits, where one might have `fn foo<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a str`, but implement it for some type where the return value is a fixed string.\n",

    "body": "> &'static str is also a &'a str for any 'a\n\nI see, `&'static str` can be \"re-borrowed\" as `&'a str` for any `a` because `&'static str` is always available (or in other words `a` is always \"shorter\" than or equal to `static`). For some reason, I always forget that the compiler can do that.\n\nI was analyzing the issue from the other way: that `&'a str` would have to be \"upgraded\" to `&'static str`, which is not possible.\n\nThanks for the explanation @huonw! My misunderstanding, closing.\n",
