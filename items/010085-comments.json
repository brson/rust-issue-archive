We currently don't have a lot of symlink support, but I would imagine that if you copy a symlink to the file that it points to you would run into similar trouble (and this doesn't handle that case).\n\nFor the directory case, I would be much happier about attempting the copy, and then if the copy fails we remove the file we just created (the destination). There would be no special logic for whether we were copying a directory or not (what happens if you copy a unix pipe into a destination, I presume that creates an empty file as well).\n",
