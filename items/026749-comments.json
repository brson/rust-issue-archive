The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @huonw (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton, would you reconsider patching libcore to allow disabling float support? This is adding a lot of manual steps to thepowersgang's barebones kernel build, requiring getting, patching (usually merging by hand), and rebuilding a modified libcore w/ every Rust update.\n\nIt seems to me that float support in libcore is a good idea in the general case. Given the correct initialization, it can be done in a freestanding environment, so it makes sense to include it. But, at the same time, there are use cases that don't want to do that initialization. Given it would require breaking the ABI (specifically, the calling convention) in LLVM and, that by all normal standards, SSE support is guaranteed on amd64, I doubt we'll see a fix from LLVM. (Nonetheless, I've posted to their development list to get their thoughts on it.)\n\n> Perhaps the solution is then to dig around in LLVM rather than adding a compile mode to libcore?\n\n```\n// If this is x86-64, and we disabled SSE, we can't return FP values,\n// or SSE or MMX vectors.\nif ((ValVT == MVT::f32 || ValVT == MVT::f64 ||\n     VA.getLocReg() == X86::XMM0 || VA.getLocReg() == X86::XMM1) &&\n      (Subtarget->is64Bit() && !Subtarget->hasSSE1())) {\n  report_fatal_error(\"SSE register return with SSE disabled\");\n}\n```\n\nIn the method `X86TargetLowering::LowerReturn`. The problem is that it's technically correct functionality. The only possible workaround would be for them to invent with their own nonstandard calling convention for amd64. Both GCC and Clang return the same error when trying to use floats in amd64 w/ SSE disabled, even with software floats enabled.\n\nTest case (`gcc/clang -mno-sse -msoft-float test.c`):\n\n```\ndouble foo() { return 0.0; }\nint main() { foo(); return 0; }\n```\n\n(With and without `-msoft-float`, the result is the same.) So it doesn't seem this error will be going away.  Out of the options:\n- Removing f32/64 from libcore and moving it to std: This would screw anyone doing freestanding in an environment that supports floats.\n- Leaving it as is: Screws kernel devs.\n- Add cfg option: Everybody's happy!(?)\n\ncc @Gankro \n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton While you can definitely build a kernel that makes use of SSE registers, it is usually not desirable to do so, as you want to minimize the number of registers saved on context switches as much as possible. Especially with wide registers (such as SSE) because they may have higher access latencies than general purpose register. Also note that just disabling SSE in the build and not using float/double is not good enough since llvm usually tries to make good use of those registers to optimize other stuff in libcore.\n\nThere was a point in time where LLVM was able to compile libcore without SSE _and_ floating point support. There is currently an open bug for LLVM that seems to target the same issue (for C++), so it may be better to wait and see how this gets resolved: https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23203\n",

    "body": "@gz, I think the fact that both gcc and llvm have the same \"SSE return while SSE disabled\" error suggests that the change that caused this was a bug fix rather than a removal of functionality. It used to result in a miscompilation, including SSE when SSE is disabled, which (as of the bug fix) they catch and throw an error. If I get some time this weekend I'll try building libcore <1.2 with SSE disabled and check the disassembly for SSE instructions. (This was the point of the GGC/LLVM section in my last post, but I forgot to get around to making it explicit. Sorry if you already got it and I'm just being overly verbose now.)\n",

I've modified an old version of @thepowersgang's barebones to do some floating point math, disassembled it, and verified that is had call to `__muldf3@PLT` (a builtin for multiplication of soft floats) and no mention of `xmm` (SSE registers) whatsoever. I even ran it on qemu amd64 and it worked. FWIW, I tested with #26000.\n\nSo, the above would make it sound like an LLVM regression. _But_, I used `--emit=llvm-ir` and tested the LLVM with a my system `llc` (3.6.2), using only the `-soft-float` option, and it had functioning soft floats (same as above). This really doesn't make any sense. My best guess is that the `-C soft-float` option passed to Rust doesn't make it to the LLVM backend, but at this point it seems like it's going to take some familiarity with Rust's codebase, so I'm lost.\n",
