    "body": "The current pattern of the rust compiler is to have very large libraries with lots and lots of modules inside them. This has become less than desirable for a few reasons\n- Large crates lead to higher compile-times.\n- Large crates fail to have a clear separation of functionality between modules (because modules are cyclical)\n- It's tough to easily get at \"just the functionality you want\" from a large crate.\n\nEssentially, whenever you link to a crate, you should be planning on using the majority of the crate. Currently, this is not at all the case of libextra where each module is very different in functionality than the next. All of the contents of libextra are quite valuable, but they're arguably more valuable on their own. Functionality like the `time` module could be _vastly_ expanded into very high quality bindings to everything related to time, but not all this functionality belongs in a \"conglomerate crate\".\n\nWe would like to start fostering a pattern of smaller, more focused crates than we've been doing in the past, starting with libextra being broken up. These smaller crates will allow for greater individual expansion in the future instead of maintaining one monolithic crate.\n\nEssentially, we want to break up libextra in order to foster futher innovation of crates. Development times will improve (smaller crates), more functionality can come in (not a giant crate to worry about), and existing functionality can be refined more quickly (smaller focus when dealing with a single nugget of functionality).\n\nI may be leaving something out, but that's the general idea in my mind at least.\n",

    "body": "My own perspective on why we're doing this:\n\nIt's long been a consensus that smaller libraries are better for Rust's compilation model, and we have a strong desire to not have a large, monolithic, and in some ways inflexible standard library (like Java). So we want to have a strong ecosystem of easily accessible and featureful crates, some of which are officially supported and part of the 'standard rust distribution'.\n\nSo the standard library is intended to be small and focused on core language and runtime infrastructure, but the standard _libraries_ should be expansive.\n\nWe're having a hard time getting to this stage because of the delays in finishing rustpkg. Rust gets a lot of pull requests for interesting library functionality, and we want to encourage that while also resisting piling everything into std, so as an interim solution to support the continued expansion of Rust's libraries we need to get libextra broken up so that the library organization begins to look like our our eventual goals, and we get experince with the many-crates model.\n",

Even the [style guide](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-style-guide#wiki-imports) says \"Prefer to fully import types while **module-qualifying functions**\" (my emphasis).\n\nSome basic statistics: the first is counting the number of occurrences of `use std::<name>;` (importing a module) the second is `use std::<name>::` (i.e. probably importing a function) and the last is `use std::<name>::<lowercase letter>` (same as the second, but filtering out imports like `use std::cell::Cell;` which are types)\n\n``` sh\n$ git grep 'use std::[^:]*;' | wc -l\n936\n$ git grep 'use std::[^:]*::' | wc -l\n1096\n$ git grep 'use std::[^:]*::[^A-Z]'  | wc -l\n650\n```\n\nSo, one certainly cannot say that using a module is rare. Also note that the second number includes imports like `use std::io::fs;` (a nested submodule) and lines like `use std::cell::Cell` (types), so it is overcounting the number of function import lines. The third number is an approximate count excluding the types, but it still includes the nested module imports and imports like `use std::io::{File, BufferedReader}`, and so is also an overestimate of the actual function import lines.\n\n(In any case, this discussion is offtopic for this PR.)\n",
