    "body": "@reem The need for `Reflect` stabilization has to do with the fact that `Any` requires `'static`, which is a constraint we do not wish to impose on `Error`. (It makes good sense for `Any`, since the trait is only usable with `'static` values anyway, but `Error` of course has more uses than downcasting.) So the two are not equivalent.\n\nre: forward compatibility of the deprecation path -- good point. This will require blanket impls and OIBIT to coexist. But that seems plausible (cc @nikomatsakis).\n\nI suppose the main alternative to this change, which we discussed on IRC, would be to wait until upcasting it working and then ask people to use e.g. `Box<Error + Any>` when they want downcasting, rather than baking it in to the error type. As we discussed, this increases flexibility, but makes it much easier to lock APIs out of the ability to downcast, and then be stuck. Since downcasting is a fairly central part of `Error`, I'm still inclined toward this change.\n\nFYI: I also updated with your other suggestions. Thanks!\n\n@alexcrichton @nikomatsakis thoughts?\n",

    "body": "@glaebhoerl Continuing along the lines of what @alexcrichton said: it's still the case that enums are the recommended, conventional way to provide concrete error types, and should be preferred to downcasting when practical.\n\nThat said, there are places where downcasting is appropriate. One important example that @alexcrichton is the `io::Error` type. During IO reform, we initially proposed for various traits like `Read`/`Write` have an associated error type, but in practice we found this to come at a massive cost in ergonomics, and instead reverted to a single concrete error type. But it's still sometimes desirable to pass a custom error through the traits. To enable this, the error type provides a \"custom\" variant that is a boxed `Error`, and is intended for downcasting.\n\nNow, I've long maintained that such use cases are important, but why build downcasting into the `Error` trait itself? In general, we often have to make tough decisions about traits that are primarily used for trait objects (rather than generic bounds): that's a one-way abstraction, so if one API gives you a `Box<Error>` but downcasting was separate (say, you'd have to have `Box<ReflectError>`), then you're stuck -- you would not be able to downcast, and it would be a breaking change to alter the type. Similar problems arise with marker traits (`Box<Error + Send>`). So in these cases, we have to think carefully about the anticipated uses of trait objects, and try to make a good decision about the defaults, to decrease the likelihood of painting your APIs into a corner.\n\nWith all of that said, one of the primary use cases of `Error` for _trait objects_ is indeed downcasting. (The other being extracting textual messages/cause chains.) Baking it in this way ensures that all uses of the `Error` trait are ready to handle this use case. This doesn't impose a burden on implementors of the trait, but it might indeed suggest that downcasting is more \"blessed\" than we mean it to be. We'll have to counter this with strong conventions documentation.\n",

    "body": "@aturon Thanks for explaining! An associated error type was indeed the alternative solution I had in mind, but if that was tried and proved untenable, then I guess that's that. I'm mostly concerned because dynamically downcasting exception types happens to be _the_ idiomatic error handling solution in a large number of very popular languages, and it would be very easy to see that become the done thing in Rust as well if we're not watchful. I guess we'll have to make sure the documentation is clear about this. :)\n",
