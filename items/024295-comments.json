The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "When you forget to put a `self` before an attribute `attr` in a method, the compiler gives the following warning:\n\n```\nunresolved name `attr`. Did you mean `self.attr`?\n```\n\nSo the information is all in one error. I wanted to emulate this behaviour. I have followed your suggestion and added a span_help, such that the compiler output looks like:\n\n```\nmsg_test.rs:12:21: 12:22 error: unknown character escape\nmsg_test.rs:12   let foo = \"hello \\{\";\n                                   ^\nmsg_test.rs:12:21: 12:22 help: If used in a formatting string, curly braces are escaped with '{{' and '}}'.\nmsg_test.rs:12   let foo = \"hello \\{\";\n                                   ^\n```\n\n(PS: this also confirms that this can also happen in a non-format string :))\n",
