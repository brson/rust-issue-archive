I have some fixes to the unicode script in a wip branch of my own (mostly moving from switch statements to static tables now that we support those) but it doesn't cover the \"slightly more than basic\" stuff like normalization forms, collation and case folding. Also locales and message formatting.\n\nWe discussed a bit more at the end of the workweek and concluded ... in an unsatisfying place: that libICU is the only non-LGPL thing we can use as a project dependency, but that it's too big and clunky to make a dependency of libcore, and should be an external package managed by rustpkg when it's in shape (possibly one we consider part of the canonical / standard package set that mozilla supports).\n\nThis is roughly where we _started_ from -- not able to commit to wanting \"full\" unicode (libICU is over 20mb of binary footprint) so thinking in terms of libcore containing a \"partial\" unicode library, like the one it currently has (possibly plus some more functions). Where to draw the line remains ... confusing to me, to say the least. There are a lot of parts to unicode.\n\nWhere would you draw the line?\n",
