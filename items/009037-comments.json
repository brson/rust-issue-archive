    "body": "Isn't this inference correct? One needs to explicitly cast the result of `bar` to `int` if one wants it to be an int, i.e.\n\n``` rust\nfn foo() -> uint { 1 }\nfn main() {\n    let x: int = foo(); // should be `foo() as int`\n}\n```\n\n```\n9037.rs:3:17: 3:23 error: mismatched types: expected `int` but found `uint` (expected int but found uint)\n9037.rs:3     let x: int = foo();\n                           ^~~~~~\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nI guess it's a little unintuitive that `-1` can be a `uint`; although it makes sense mathematically: it's the number the you can add to `1` which gives `0` (e.g., for a 64-bit platform this is `18446744073709551615`, since this is `2^64 - 1`).\n",

    "body": "I think this actually is pretty surprising behavior.  Sure, I understand the math and all that.  But I bet 99% of uses of literal negative numbers are intended to be ints as opposed to uints.  If, in my example code, I hadn't had the if statement, I wouldn't have noticed this until it bit me.  And one of the reviewers of my actual code where this actually came up didn't notice it either (@alexcrichton).  Alex asked me to file this bug report, actually.  So I think the literal negatives should be treated as signed, and users who want unsigned should have to do -1u.  That's optimizing for the common case / the principle of least surprise.\n",

This behavior is inconsistent (it wraps in one direction but not the other.)\n\nI already had one issue where I passed a negative value to a function I wrote which expects an unsigned value, and Rust silently accepted it. However, in other code it refused to compile because the literals were too large. For consistency, both need to be accepted or both need to be rejected; half-assing it can give someone the impression the language won't allow such voodoo without warning, and then it quietly allows it somewhere else.\n",
