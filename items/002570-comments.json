If we make \"this pattern has X fields, but the corresponding variant has no fields\" non-fatal, and we try to compile a simple test case, we get a scary \"no type for node\" error and an ICE.  The upshot, I think, is that this should stay fatal unless we're willing do something to catch these errors in various places further down the line.\n\nincidentally, we don't have any tests with the \"this pattern has X fields, but the corresponding variant has Y fields\" error pattern.  I'll add one.\n",
