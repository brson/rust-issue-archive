  "body": "I would've also changed the `min` and `max` functions in `core::cmp`, but they were marked as stable and operated by-value rather than by-reference, so I want to check if it was okay.\n\nThe new methods return the greater/lesser of two values, and if an ordering cannot be found or the two values are equal, return the value that the method was called on (`self`).\n\nAs for the `min`/`max` functions, would it be a good idea to a) change them to use the min/max methods provided from `PartialOrd`, and b) only require `PartialOrd` rather than `Ord`. Or should they just be left alone as they are \"stable\".\n",
