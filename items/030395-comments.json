    "body": "Cargo does currently do some probing of the filesystem, so it may be the case that it's a little to eager to propagate errors upwards in some circumstances, but that's definitely a bug in Cargo! You should be able to layer projects over one another and Cargo should continue to work just fine.\n\nAs @durka mentioned, though, could you reopen this in the Cargo repo? I don't think this has much to do with the compiler itself, and that's where all the code for Cargo lives.\n",
