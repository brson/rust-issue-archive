    "body": "@P1start I think styling issues might be just due to different people writing pieces of it. They are all valid on some grammar notation or another. The entire documents was copied from the reference.md.\nFor what is worth, we do need consistency on the rules and the documents starts with a grammar for the grammars, which appears to be a slight modification over EBNF syntax. \n\n``` antlr\ngrammar : rule + ;\nrule    : nonterminal ':' productionrule ';' ;\nproductionrule : production [ '|' production ] * ;\nproduction : term * ;\nterm : element repeats ;\nelement : LITERAL | IDENTIFIER | '[' productionrule ']' ;\nrepeats : [ '*' | '+' ] NUMBER ? | NUMBER ? | '?' ;\n```\n\n> Where:\n> - Whitespace in the grammar is ignored.\n> - Square brackets are used to group rules.\n> - LITERAL is a single printable ASCII character, or an escaped hexadecimal ASCII > code of the form \\xQQ, in single quotes, denoting the corresponding Unicode codepoint U+00QQ.\n> - IDENTIFIER is a nonempty string of ASCII letters and underscores.\n> - The repeat forms apply to the adjacent element, and are as follows:\n>   - ? means zero or one repetition\n>   - \\* means zero or more repetitions\n>   - \\+ means one or more repetitions\n> - NUMBER trailing a repeat symbol gives a maximum repetition count\n> - NUMBER on its own gives an exact repetition count\n>   This EBNF dialect should hopefully be familiar to many readers.\n\nBased on that `( foo )` doesn't seems to be part of the grammar. \n\nPersonally I prefer defining the grammar with `::=` or `:=` for productions. It's an extra key stroke but it makes the rule easier to read, at least to me. \n\nIn any case it seems we have to:\n0. (pick a grammar...)\n1. clean up the existing productions to make them consistent with the grammar we will be using to define them. \n2. Complete the missing sections\n\nThe questions now is whether we do this collaboration against my fork or we merge this and do it against rust-lang. I don't know how you guys generally handle WIP from multiple sources.\n",
