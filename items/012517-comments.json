    "body": "We had some discussion about this on IRC. I think this option is probably the best compromise. \n\n(For my own reference, and to summarize other bugs, iiuc there are 3 fundamental options:\n1. All total ordered.\n2. Types may implement both partially and totally ordered traits, and the behavior of those traits may different.\n3. The totally ordered traits do not define additional methods but simply imply additional laws governing the same methods of the partially ordered traits. That is, the ordering for a single type must be consistent. Implies that f32 and f64 do not implement Ord but only PartialOrd, and hence implies some kind of newtyped float types.\n\nI think Option 3 is probably a good compromise between total principle (option 1) and total pragmatism (option 2), and I think that Option 3 is what this proposal is about.)\n",

    "body": "I was thinking about this tonight, and I wanted to jot down my ideas before I forget.\n\n---\n\nI found a very useful tactic for thinking about this to start from the goal and go back to the implementation. From all the discussions I've heard around this, it sounds like \"total equality\" is the correct default, but the idea of \"partial equality\" must be a property of the type, hence there should be a distinction in the traits.\n\nI thought of these examples for how I expect usage of `Eq` and friends to look like:\n\n``` rust\n// Struct that has all the comparison operators\n// Fails if anything is a float\n#[deriving(Eq, Ord)]\nstruct Foo { ... }\n\n// Manual implementation of the == operator (you get != for free)\nimpl Eq for Foo {\n    fn eq(&self, other: &Foo) -> bool { ... }\n}\n\n// Manual implementation of all comparison operators\nimpl Ord for Foo {\n    fn cmp(&self, other: &Foo) -> Ordering { ... }\n}\n\n// This function can use the == operator (same for Ord and comparison operators)\nfn foo<T: Eq>() {}\n\n// This function can also use the == operator (same for PartialOrd and comparison operators)\nfn foo<T: PartialEq>() {}\n```\n\nWith this in mind, the current plan of action (the checklist at the top) achieves almost all of these, except for the manual implementation ones. We have made explicit decision in the past to keep `deriving` simple (not have lots of options to customize the derived code). I would expect manual implementations of `Eq` and `Ord` to be fairly common. Having to explain why our default equality trait to implement is called `PartialEq` would make me quite sad.\n\nEssentially, this proposed system makes it quite nice to use the comparison traits, but it makes it unwieldy to define them manually. This musing isn't very useful unless something good comes of it, so here's a todo list which may be able to address my concerns:\n- [ ] `trait Eq { fn eq(&self) -> bool; }`\n- [ ] `trait PartialEq { fn equals(&self) -> bool; fn nequals(&self) -> bool; }`\n- [ ] `trait Ord { fn cmp(&self) -> Ordering; }`\n- [ ] `trait PartialOrd { /* four comparison methods returning bool */ }`\n- [ ] Keep the partial/total traits _entirely separate_. Do not link them with inheritance.\n- [ ] Wire all operators to the partial traits.\n- [ ] `deriving(Trait)` only derives the `Trait` trait for _all_ traits. (deriving a total ordering doesn't also derive a partial ordering).\n- [ ] `impl<T: Eq> PartialEq for T { ... }`\n- [ ] `impl<T: Ord> PartialOrd for T { ... }`\n\nWith this checklist, I believe that both my constraints and the constraints at the top of this issue are all satisfied. The only snag is that the current version of the compiler will reject any manual implementations of `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` (hence floats would have nothing implemented).\n\nWe were talking at the work week about lifting this restriction, and if others are amenable to this strategy, I would like to rekindle discussion about lifting the restriction. It looks that with the traits not linked to one another that you almost never have to see that the partial orderings exist, but you get them all for free. Additionally, `deriving` doesn't start doing super magical things for the comparison traits (deriving two traits actually), but rather it only ever derives one.\n",

    "body": "For many types, it's going to be inefficient to define the methods returning `bool` by reusing `cmp`. LLVM is often going to fail to optimize it to the ideal implementation for non-trivial types with pointers, and with a generic implementation there's no way to provide an override. It would also mean that there would be an extra user-facing equality method, which I think is confusing.\n\nIn my opinion, there's a language flaw we should fix here and I don't think this is the only place it's going to come up. A numeric hierarchy or container hierarchy will run into these same issues, as some types can provide more guarantees than others. There will be cases where there's something to gain from splitting up the trait hierarchy a bit more, but it currently adds noise for every single implementation. While adding two more hooks to the compiler for the total ordering traits can sidestep most of the issues here, I think a more general solution would be nicer.\n\nIt should be possible to make use of trait inheritance for fine-grained trait hierarchies _without_ placing a large burden on every implementation. I really liked @sfackler's proposal about this on IRC and have been thinking about it some more. If the language allowed you to implement methods from supertraits in the same implementation block, the syntactic noise would go away. It would also mean that deriving would still only be outputting a single implementation block, but I don't think it's an incredibly important concern. With a generic implementation, you're just as unable to define the `PartialEq` trait yourself after deriving `Eq`.\n",

    "body": "If performance is the only concern, I think that it can be circumvented where necessary. You can always create a newtype wrapper and implement `PartialEq` directly. It would require that the consumer uses a `PartialEq` instead of `Eq` bound, but if you're dealing with very performance sensitive code you're likely at liberty to change that already. It doesn't quite sound like a showstopper to me.\n\nIt's tough to consider this in a world where you can implement multiple traits in one block as I'm not quite sure how that would all work out. It's certainly RFC-worthy, and I'd like to see that before going down the rabbit hole of figuring out how it would interact with everything else.\n",

In that case float ergonomics will suffer, for instance `[0f32, 1.] == [0., 1.]` won't work. To ease the pain we could manually `impl PartialEq for [f32, ..N]` up to `N = 32`, etc.\n",
