    "body": "Nice! This feels like it's a bit ad-hoc though and it'd unfortunately be an insta-stable interface to the compiler. For something like `cargo check` I don't think this is necessary as 99% of the time all your dependencies are already built, but I've wanted this for other aspects such as documenting other platforms and/or pipelining compilations.\n\nSome specific concerns I have are:\n- This just uses the same `rlib` format, but the object file is notably missing. This can lead to surprising errors if you try to actually link against those rlibs. I imagined this would create a whole new separate file type (e.g. `*.rmeta`) which the compiler would then give a first-class error message about not being able to link against if that is requested.\n- The relationship between `-Z no-trans` and `--emit=rmeta` is somewhat odd to me, I would expect the compiler to naturally stop at the right point if only `--emit=rmeta` is present (e.g. as it does with other output types today).\n- Implementation-wise I'd prefer to see rmeta have a more first-class position instead of being a few targeted if-else conditionals on the normal rlib path as these two forms may diverge over time.\n",

    "body": ">  But I do want @bstrie to asses whether this would work for cargo check.\n\nWith https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/1701, I believe that `cargo check` is basically `cargo rustc -- -Z no-trans`, so I'd recommend starting to investigate there (before taking this route)\n\n> The reason -Z no-trans isn't \"implied\" by --emit=rlibmeta is because the metadata actually changes after trans, as it gets symbol names and a few other things (that only influence trans in downstream crates).\n\nInteresting! I had forgotten about this. This poses an interesting problem that may be difficult to overcome, unfortunately. In terms of pipelining compilations, there are two synchronization points which need to happen if we have two sets of metadata:\n1. Once the first phase of metadata is produced, immediate downstream dependents can start compiling.\n2. Once I'm ready to trans, all upstream dependencies need to have produced the second phase of metadata before I can continue.\n\nI feel like managing multiple synchronization points in the compiler could get quite complicated (even one is nontrivial), and if we take a route like this I'd much prefer to minimize the complexity as much as possible.\n\nIn the ideal world we could do something like have a \"dry run\" of trans which doesn't actually translate anything (but calculates symbol names), or perhaps even just have the ability to calculate symbol names ahead of trans. That way there'd only need to be one metadata format that's the same across dylibs, rlibs, and standalone files.\n",

It's quite nice that an rlib and/or dylib is a standalone artifact that doesn't need to be paired with something else, so I'd prefer to keep it like that if possible.\n\n> Don\u2019t we bundle metadata with shared libraries as well?
