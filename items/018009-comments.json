    "body": "@gamazeps Huh? BitV still uses uints. \n\nI did start up a branch expecting it to be a quick CTRL+H job, but got too distracted in the bigger \"needs a full review\" issue as I went over all the changes to make sure I wasn't messing something up. In particular, reading over the code, it's really hard to tell locally what should be a uint, and what should be a u32 (is that value a word, or an index?). I've been pretty scatter-brained/sick lately, and don't have enough time/energy to ensure I'm not screwing the whole API up. I've been sticking to writing/design stuff for the past-while since it's easier for me to squeeze in short bursts when I'm not doing school stuff. Also fever-dream prose is just hard to read, not a bug.\n\nIf you want to pick up and finish the work [on my branch](https://github.com/Gankro/rust/tree/bitv-cleanup), feel free!\n",

It's  mixed in with my Cursor work on this branch: https://github.com/Gankro/rust/compare/dlist-seek\n\nThe first commit is the refactor work, though it also features more sweeping reform in anticipation of introducing cursors: https://github.com/Gankro/rust/commit/4e259d21fd92e8e7b7880b8540b758da73709b37\n\nAt the time, I thought it was hopeless, but I realize now that it should mostly \"just work\" if you manually mark the RawLink's NoCopy. Skimming over it again now, I also came to the conclusion that the fact that we make frequently make invalid RawLinks transiently, so that makes dereffing them unsafe. That... might be valid?\n\nThis kind of goes hand-in-hand with some unsafe code conventions I've been mulling over in my mind. Specifically, is internal code reasonable to mark safe if assumes pre-conditions? That is, if it assumes it's only called when the structure is in a \"valid\" state, and not a transient \"invalid\" one? \n",
