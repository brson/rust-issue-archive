    "body": "@pnkfelix Do you have a preference on how to fix the `run-make/simd-ffi` test with parallel `make check`?\n\nI have a fix now, but it's not successfully tested.\n\nParallel `make check` now fails because the `run-make/simd-ffi` test is run in parallel, and it has multiple phony targets that generate the same output file.  I think it's easy to fix that test.  Alternatively, we could disable parallelism for `run-make` tests by modifying `src/etc/maketest.py` somehow: (1) add `-j 1` to the command-line or (2) filter/clear `MAKEFLAGS`.  I'm leaning towards `-j 1` if we want to disable parallelism.  I think we require GNU make, so I would think `-j 1` wouldn't break anything.\n",
