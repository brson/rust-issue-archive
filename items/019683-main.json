  "body": "This patch does not itself enable generalized where clauses, but it lays the groundwork. Rather than storing a list of bounds per type parameter, the trait selection and other logic is now driven by a unified list of predicates. All predicate handling is now driven through a common interface. This also fixes a number of bugs where region predicates were being dropped on the floor. As a drive-by, this patch also fixes some bugs in the opt-out-copy feature flag.\n\nThat said, this patch does not change the parser or AST in any way, so we still _generate_ the list of predicates by walking a list of bounds (and we still _store_ the bounds on the `TypeParameterDef` and so on). Those will get patched in a follow-up.\n\nThe commits in this case are standalone; the first few are simple refactorings.\n\nr? @nick29581 \ncc @aturon \n",
