    "body": "So my initial strategy was going to be to land this and then follow up with a blanket deprecation pass, following that up with a blanket stabilization pass. The idea would be to only deprecate things that should have been deprecated some time ago, and also only stabilize minor apis that should have been stable awhile ago.\n\nI'm rethinking this, though, as if I'm using these unstable features I may have to update code twice where otherwise I could just lump all the changes into this one PR. Thoughts on whether these blanket passes for \"easy\" things should happen now or later? I do suspect it will delay this PR to add more stabilizations to it, but we still have a few weeks to the release (and I wouldn't want to cherry-pick stabilizations into the 1.1 branch).\n",
