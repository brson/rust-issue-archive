  "body": "These types had many instances of `T: Send + Sync` in places they were not necessary.\n\nIn fact, the only place they are required is when considering under what circumstances can `Arc<T>` (etc.) be sent/shared across thread boundaries, i.e. the only place it matters is the `unsafe impl`s of `Send` and `Sync`. It is perfectly safe for an `Arc<T>` to stay on and be used on a single thread if `T` doesn't satisfy the necessary bounds. It just acts like a (expensive) `Rc<T>`. The added flexibility may be convenient in generic code. (Similar reasoning applies to `Mutex`, `RwLock` and `sync::mpsc`. See commit messages for some more details.)\n\nThis also fixes a hole, where `Arc::new` has no bounds on `T`, but `Drop for Arc<T>` requires `T: Send + Sync` (meaning one could theoretically create an `Arc` type which has no destructor, although the compiler mishandles this case anyway).\n",
