    "body": "@alexcrichton Writing a non-blocking reader seems like a valid thing to do, as long as you're aware of the pitfalls.\n\nMy biggest worry is that all the methods should work if a single call to the Reader returns 0. I'm less concerned about infinitely looping 0's, although I think it would be nice to address that. Ideally any default Reader method that loops until it gets non-0 would also have a counter and abort if it loops too many times without any data (and of course resetting the counter if it gets any non-0 result back, even if it continues looping).\n\nI feel like Go had an issue around this same problem last year, one that I filed, and that they eventually addressed it, but I forget the particulars.\n",
