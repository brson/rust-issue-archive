    "body": "Thanks! This looks good to me.\n\nNext time I write `assert(this)` (assuming I wrote that but maybe not) I'll be sure to add a comment why. I don't remember what exactly it was protecting against, but there is some tricky multithreading around this class so presumably at some point there was a problem with `this` being deleted in another thread. Regardless, it's not doing anything now so good riddance.\n",
