    "body": "@nikomatsakis The basic issue isn't that complicated, I just didn't explain it well. The error-reporting functions currently accept an expected type and an actual type, and suppress the error if either is ty_err. But the pattern-match-checking code is top-down, so there's no expected type to use. So in my last commit to this code, I synthesized an expected type based on the structure of the pattern and the actual types of the sub-patterns. This usually didn't work because the pattern-match-checking code would check the sub-patterns with ty_err as an expected type once an error was detected -- so then, reporting an error for the parent pattern, the expected type would be ty_err and no error would be reported. But, ty_err would get written into the type context, causing the trans error that we saw later.\n\nHopefully that's clearer...\n",
