    "body": "@dan-t This is why the current API exposes `filename` and `dirname` -- so that you can get at the non-utf8 data. If you want a lossy conversion non utf-8, you can use [from_utf8_lossy](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/collections/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf8_lossy) (which is what `display` uses as well).\n\nFWIW, this whole module is being redesigned in a new [path RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/474).\n\nI'm going to close this issue for now.\n",
