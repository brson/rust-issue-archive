  "body": "Paper over privacy issues with Deref by changing field names.\n\nTypes that implement Deref can cause weird error messages due to their\nprivate fields conflicting with a field of the type they deref to, e.g.,\npreviously\n\n```\nstruct Foo { x: int }\n\nlet a: Arc<Foo> = ...;\nprintln!(\"{}\", a.x);\n```\n\nwould complain the the `x` field of `Arc` was private (since Arc has a\nprivate field called `x`) rather than just ignoring it.\n\nThis patch doesn't fix that issue, but does mean one would have to write\n`a._ptr` to hit the same error message, which seems far less\ncommon. (This patch `_`-prefixes all private fields of\n`Deref`-implementing types.)\n\ncc #12808\n",
