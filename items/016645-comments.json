That way the \"normal\" use case of just using `std` will be more straightforward, as will the other use case of running with `#[no_std]`, since both groups will only be searching the docs that apply to them.\n",

    "body": "A more general solution might be to link re-exports in the docs to their original source, so that you can look in the `std` docs and see everything labeled as a re-export specifically from `core` or `collections` or wherever.\n\nThe only issue might be when something is re-exported from somewhere private, which could just be special-cased. Or maybe the documentation could be placed at the re-export that the library writer wants it at.\n\nI'd prefer that over separating the docs, and it would work better for third party libraries as well.\n",

    "body": "Whether or not a definition is a re-export from a different crate is a user visible property, because all possible paths to the same item are interchangeable:\n\n``` rust\nextern crate core;\nlet _: std::option::Option<uint> = core::option::Some(0u);\n```\n\nBecause of that it is my opinion that the docs should always provide a full chain of links for each reexport step, skipping/hiding all private ones in the chain:\n\n``` rust\n// my_crate\npub use self::pub_mod::Foo;\npub mod pub_mod {\n     pub use self::priv_mod::Foo;\n     mod priv_mod {\n         pub struct Foo;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should show you both `::Foo` and `::pub_mod::Foo` in the docs, mention that `::Foo` is a reexport of `::pub_mod::Foo` and mention that _that_ is a reexport of a private type as well (Or just tread the last public link in the chain as the original definition)\n\nFor ergonomic reasons every reexport should probably show the docs of their item directly inline in the documentation as if the item where defined there, **but** also put a clearly visible info at the top that this is a reexport, including links to the the next link in the reexport chain:\n\n> # Enum std::option::Option\n> \n> ## Reexported from `core::option::Option`\n> \n> Original docs...\n\nRelated to this, the rustdoc search should group things that are exports of each other together, or hide them by default.\n\nInstead of this:\n\n> # Results for Option\n> \n> std::option\n> std::option::Option\n> std::os::MapOption\n> std::ptr::RawPtr::to_option\n> core::iter::MinMaxResult::into_option\n> std::option_env!\n> std::sync::atomic::AtomicOption\n> std::sync::atomics::AtomicOption\n> std::rand::Rng::choose_option\n> rand::XorShiftRng::choose_option\n> rand::isaac::IsaacRng::choose_option\n> rand::reseeding::ReseedingRng::choose_option\n> core::option\n> core::option::Option\n> rustc::driver::config::Options\n> getopts::Occur::Optional\n> core::ptr::RawPtr::to_option\n\nIt should look kinda like this:\n\n> # Results for Option\n> \n> std::option\n> - core::option\n> \n> std::option::Option\n> - core::option::Option\n> \n> std::os::MapOption\n> std::ptr::RawPtr::to_option\n> - core::ptr::RawPtr::to_option\n> \n> core::iter::MinMaxResult::into_option\n> std::option_env!\n> std::sync::atomic::AtomicOption\n> - std::sync::atomics::AtomicOption\n> \n> std::rand::Rng::choose_option\n> rand::XorShiftRng::choose_option\n> rand::isaac::IsaacRng::choose_option\n> rand::reseeding::ReseedingRng::choose_option\n> rustc::driver::config::Options\n> getopts::Occur::Optional\n",
