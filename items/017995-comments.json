    "body": "@nikomatsakis The idea here is to be able to quickly rule out methods that cannot match no matter what. The idea is loosely inspired by CSS selector matching: instead of having a list of methods and having to go to the trouble of creating type variables and unifying self types, we introduce a \"base type\" (here called `SimplifiedType`) that all methods are \"keyed off\". The idea here is that if `basetype(callee type) != basetype(self type of impl)`, then `callee type` cannot possibly match `self type of impl`. To account for autoderef/autoref, base types \"look through\" pointers, so `&int`, `&&int`, and `Box<int>` will all have the base type `int`. Not all types have base types (for example, tuples); if no base type can be determined the full, most general unification code is used. However, that is rare (less than 10% of cases).\n\nThere is a complication here in that for smart pointers methods can be called on either the smart pointer itself or the referent type. That is why smart pointers actually have two \"base types\"\u2014one for the smart pointer and one for the type it points to\u2014and methods are considered to possibly match if they have either the base type of the smart pointer _or_ the base type of the referent.\n\nWe also use this same idea to rule out trying overloaded operators if they cannot possibly match. Autoderef doesn't happen for overloaded operators though, so that's why we have allow/disallow deref flags.\n\nDoes this make more sense?\n",

I'll take another look and see if I can figure it out. I was planning to do a more general cache; I wonder if this approach replaces and/or complements that idea. (I mean, clearly you can do both, but it's not clear that a cache adds much over this in terms of execution time; it's also unclear if a cache alone would do better than this or worse).
