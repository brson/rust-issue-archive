See e.g. #24761 and #24954.\n\nThis change does _not_ fix them; it just makes the assert more immediate (and also injects a more conservative check, in that we are also checking that the files match up).\n\nSo, this does not directly fix any bugs, and is expected to actually inject new ICE's.  But those will all represent latent bugs that need fixing.\n",
