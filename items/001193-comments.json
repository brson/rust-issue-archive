    "body": "The fix for this also has the effect that you can no longer name-shadow a constant (for example, if a const `epsilon` is in scope, that means you can't say `let mut epsilon...`, which actually came up in the float library), unless I make the code more complicated by distinguishing between patterns in alts and patterns elsewhere. Personally I'd rather just rename things, but just pointing that out.\n",
