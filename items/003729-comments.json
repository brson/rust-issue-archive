    "body": "So this dates from c9c5ee252a8523778377f2832765442e611e85a4 (aug 2011) when we had runtime-dynamic-sized types floating around and potentially in the inside of vectors. So the scary part of it is gone. As a minor improvement to codegen on vector glue, one might as well try to implement it properly, which just means switching from byte-adding operations on byte-pointers to GEPi on properly typed pointers.\n\nOne could also reasonably argue that this should long since have been moved into library code and/or lang items. I would not object to that solution!\n",
