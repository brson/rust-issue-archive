Could you talk about which specific lints are missing from the default warnings built-in list? I'm not personally aware of any. I'm also somewhat concerned that a `-Wall` or similar option would be confusing to some extent because \"all\" wouldn't include clippy lints (and probably can't, or at least not easily -- though I don't know the details here).",
