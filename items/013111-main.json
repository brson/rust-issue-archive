  "body": "I replaced StdRng::new with task_rng in a few tests and benchmarks (not\nin the parts being benchmarked only in the setup). This will make\nbenchmarks and tests go by slightly faster.\n\nI didn't replace the StdRng::new with task_rng in test/bench/noise.rs\nline 44 because the StdRng::new part is being measured by the\nbenchmark. I think the StdRng::new() part is a nonessential part of the\nbenchmark though so maybe it should be replaced.\n",
