    "body": "It's not a decrementing range. The type of `range_step` is `fn range<T: ...>(start: T, end: T, step: T)`. Since you're passing a `uint` as the first parameter, the other two parameters also take `uint`. Your generic literals are inferred as being `1u`, and then the negation operator (which exists for unsigned integers) is applied. I think #5477 covers the only issue here already.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger This does expose an interesting problem with the range_step function, though. As far as I'm concerned, the primary usecase is to do reverse iteration (which seems to have been deemed \"confusing\" for the range function to support), for which you need range_step(*,*,-1). Thus, all of the arguments have to be signed. However, if I want to iterate over unsigned integers, I can't reasonably always convert them to signed integers. One would reasonably expect to be able to iterate from uint::MAX to uint::MIN, but as it stands, none of the range functions seem to permit this. Or am I mistaken?\n\nEdit: I mean, you can just use range().rev() to accomplish this, but it's odd that that's necessary.\n",

    "body": "@Gankro: Reverse iteration with a step of 1 can be done with `range(n, m).rev()` because it's a double-ended iterator and that's also how you iterate in reverse over a slice. The step iterators could eventually be double-ended once there's a proper trait for enumerated types with `pred` and `succ` rather than it being a hack based on arithmetic.\n",
