    "body": "This is an unfortunate consequence of using libuv right now. All println requests go through libuv, which requires a handle to stdout. Whenever we get a libuv handle, we must eventually close it, but this will close the underlying file descriptor of the handle. To get around this, we dup the stdout file descriptor, causing you to reach the file descriptor limit fairly quickly on osx.\n\nThat being said, libuv recently had a patch (joyent/libuv@359d6678) to not close stdio file descriptors on _unix_. Sadly they're still closed on windows, so we haven't been able to fix this just yet. We can special-case unix/windows right now, but I'd almost rather just wait until https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/991 is fixed.\n\nThanks for the bug report though!\n",
