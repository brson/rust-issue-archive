    "body": "I would like to discuss this before merging. In my opinion, we should fall in one of these three buckets:\n1. Purge `*_equiv` and figure out a better way of not allocating when looking up in maps with keys of `~str`\n2. Remove everything except `find_equiv`\n3. Make `*_equiv` variants of all functions.\n\nI am most in favor of 1, but I currently do not know of a way to do that, and failing that I would favor 2 over 3. This warrants more discussion though.\n",

    "body": "I was actually wondering why not all the methods were using the equiv trait.\n- The equiv variants can do the work of the non equiv ones, and more (with no performance penalty that I can see).\n- It's a pretty nice way to deal with `&'lifetime str`/`~str.` keys IMO, and most of the work seems to be already done (which is always nice)\n\nSo I'm in favor of 2. Why would you prefer to purge them ?\n",

That being said, it's more of an idea than a concrete suggestion, so I don't think it's too useful right now.\n",
