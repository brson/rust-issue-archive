    "body": "@alexcrichton My understanding based on some of the documentation is that `TaskBuilder` was always intended to operate in this fashion. There was some documentation referencing e.g. `task().supervised().spawn(..)`. I think that behavior was simply accidentally lost when linked failure was removed.\n\nI couldn't make `.future_result()` behave the same way, of course, since it returns a `Port`, and I wasn't sure whether `.add_wrapper()` should be changed to `.with_wrapper()` so I left that alone as well.\n\nAs for missing documentation, I wasn't sure what to write for the `logger`, `stdout`, and `stderr` fields. The latter two obviously affect the stdout/stderr of that task, but that seems like a fuzzily-defined thing, since I'm not really sure what operations actually use task-local stdout/stderr. `io::stdout()`/`io::stderr()` certainly don't. As for `logger`, I have no idea what that does.\n\nIf you want to give me a description for `logger`, I think I can do the rest (for `stdout`/`stderr` I suppose I can just say that it sets the task-local `stdout`/`stderr`, and not bother trying to clarify that because `io::set_stdout()` certainly doesn't).\n",

You can't use the builder to configure anything inside of `TaskOpts`.\n\nI fear that this api still needs a fairly large overhaul because there's still lots of little gotchas here and there. I think that the builder approach is where we want to converge on, but I'm not 100% sure of that.\n\nI think we should go ahead with this PR, but I think we have aways to go for finishing `std::task`\n",

There may be usages of that method out there and I'd like to make sure we've a test for it in the code base. Also, this needs rebase.\n",
