In particular, I envisioned the \"deferred resolutions\" introduced in 9a85a17 as a more general thing, but I realized that because we don't have to worry about recursive closures for kind inference, we can simplify everything if we specialize the deferred resolutions to calls, which is done in f9e46a8.\n",

Maybe I'll try it locally and see what happens. But it doesn't make sense to error: I actually expect inference to get different results than the expectation on a fairly regular basis. For example, if the expected kind is `FnMut`, but the closure is `|x| x*2`, then the inference would yield `Fn` -- but that's perfectly legal.\n",

I immediately hit some (minor) bugs around `move` closures, which I have fixed. After that, everything bootstraps, but I get some failures in run-pass tests due to the problem I described in bullet 2 of the header: \"We can improve this situation however -- even if we don't know whether (or just how) F : FnMut(..) holds or not for some closure type F, we can still perform unification since we do know the argument and return types. Once kind inference is done, we can complete the F : FnMut(..) analysis -- which might yield an error if (e.g.) the F moves out of its environment. \"\n",
