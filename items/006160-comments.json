    "body": "The word \"path\" in the description could refer to a path on the filesystem denoting a whole crate (i.e. one provides the library file for the crate to the tool), or \"path\" could refer to a path in a Rust program, denoting some item within a crate.  (It could also refer to some combination of the two notions, but I will leave that possibility aside.)\n\nBoth interpretations sound potentially useful.  I suspect only the latter interpretation is consistent with your use-case of putting this into a REPL `:help` meta-command.\n\nIn the former interpretation, I imagine the docstring extractor would just be another command-line utility program.\n\nIn the latter interpretation, the docstring extractor sounds like it would have to be some sort of operation one expresses within Rust programs.  (It is not quite a reflection facility, since it is only extracting statically available meta-data, not runtime values.)\n\nRegarding the latter interpretation, I am a little concerned about these sentences from the Rust manual: \n\n> Every item has a _canonical path_ within its crate, but the path naming an item is only meaningful within a given\n> crate. There is no global namespace across crates; an item's canonical path merely identifies it within the crate.\n\nThis implies to me that one would want to resolve a path with respect to a particular crate (provided as an additional argument) when doing doc-string extraction; but that contradicts the interface from the first sentence of the description.  (That, or implicitly use the current crate as the basis for the resolution; I cannot tell if always using the current crate would suffice for the cases that thestinger is anticipating.)\n\n@thestinger Would you mind elaborating a little bit more about which of the above cases you were asking for?  It will help me determine where this falls in our milestone scheme.\n",
