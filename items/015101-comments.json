    "body": "Hrm, ok I just took another look, and apparently `#[repr(C)]` squelches this warning. I didn't know that was already accepted as a non-unused annotation. There's been no activity on the tracking issue #14309 for the relevant RFC.\n\n#14309 includes adding a lint for warning about non-`#[repr(C)]` structs that are used with C FFI. Perhaps that should be fast-tracked and implemented now even if no other work towards #14309 is going to be done in the short term, if that's the intended way to deal with this spurious `dead_code` warning.\n\n/cc @cmr\n",
