    "body": "Thank you for the tip. I was able to solve this by changing all the fwd slashes to escaped backslashes, as well as providing the prefix (escaped as well). I could have also done a raw string: `r(\"\\\\?\\...\")` however fwd slashes did not work, even though the typical windows api can take either; as well my editor does not know anything about raw strings. Thanks again. Does it make sense to include this by default in Rust for windows (unc conversion for win fs unicode api compatibility)?
