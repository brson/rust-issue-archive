At that point I would prefer to take the next step and reimagine how `cargo test` would work in an ideal world -- a bit like what has been done for [error messages](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/08/10/Shape-of-errors-to-come.html) over the past year. It would be so wonderful if someone takes the initiative to come up with some design proposals. The [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) repo or the users forum would be the place to follow up.",
