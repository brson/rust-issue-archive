    "body": "Tests failed because rustpkg did not consider the temporary dir to be a workspace. The old logic for \"no args\" used to just check if the parent dir was `src`, but I changed that logic to specifically check if we're inside a workspace.\n\nIf I edit the test to add a `.rust` directory inside of the temporary directory, this causes the test to pass. I assume that this test modification is appropriate in light of the new behavior.\n",
