Even if they target different goals, a style guide can help expose the idioms that make Rust so great to work with.\n",

It should rather be a set of guidelines on what to pursue and what to avoid - both in implementing rust and implementing programs in rust.

You can see a draft [here](http://aturon.github.io/). These guidelines will be moving into the rust-lang github organization in the next week or two. I would greatly appreciate any PRs!\n",
