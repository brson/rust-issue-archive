    "body": "These initialiser sections, apparently, are completely irrelevant; we initialise all our thread locals lazily on first use (and initialisers are stored in `.tdata` even on old systems). Interestingly we don\u2019t seem to use `pthread` for it either (which could be the approach to take on older systems).\n\nOver 1.5 days of debugging I managed to observe symptoms mostly indicative of invalid memory reads (e.g. SIGSEGVs after null pointer deref inside `Cell::get`) along with the issue reported originally. Basically it seems that we read uninitialised memory on first use (at least on main thread) and only on older 32 bit systems we manage to hit a corner case where `dtor_running` happens to have the same representation as `true` (LSB set to 1) \u2013 this is what makes the panic happen. ~~Even on my recent system `dtor_running` (boolean!) seems to be a pretty random byte value (e.g. `64` or `116`) which \u201cjust happens\u201d to have its LSB set to 0.~~\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I was using Fedora 14; since the package repositories are not working anymore, I didn\u2019t bother updating anything, that includes the ld or ld-linux.so.2.\n\nIn cases https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27598 wasn\u2019t hit, I could reliably reproduce the same issue and backtrace as reported in the [internals thread](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/illegal-instruction-when-i-run-main-rs/2199).  I did try using ld.gold (`-C link-args=-fuse-ld=gold`) with same results.\n\nInterestingly, the stage1 rustc compiler built on the same fedora machine works just fine. [Hand-crafted snippets of code that do not use std implementation of thread locals](https://gist.github.com/nagisa/5b962b1bacc890fbbf1f) also seem to work fine and correctly.\n\nSo it is most likely either something we do in start_lang implementation before setting thread info or the std implementation of TLS is wrong.\n",
