If I want to see what I searched for I'll just hit Forward again. But the way the UI works right now, if there's something in the search field, then I should be seeing search results.\n\nI see the comment you're referring to, but I think it's wrong. That comment should be removed and the code should be updated to clear the search box if there's no query parameter.\n",
