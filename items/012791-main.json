  "body": "The rationale and modifications can be found in the first commit message.\n\nThis does make logging a bit more painful to use initially because it involves a feature gate and some `phase` attributes, but I think it may be reasonable to not require the `phase` attribute for loading `macro_rules!` macros because defining them will still be gated.\n\n---\n\n(addendum by pnkfelix: if you have found that your `debug!` invocations have stopped working, try adding this to your crate: `#[phase(syntax, link)] extern crate log;`  Note that this requires `#[feature(phase)];`.  More complete information is available by reading the [docs for log](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/log/index.html))\n",
