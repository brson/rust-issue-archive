    "body": "The basic strategy that I recommend is to modify the parser to treat doc comments as a special type of attribute, so that they are easily and automatically associated with the appropriate AST nodes.\n\nThe one significant wrinkle is that we have to distinguish, like attributes, between docs that apply to the thing that follows and docs that apply to the preceding thing. With attributes we currently use the trailing semi:\n\n```\nmod m {\n   #[attr1]; // semi means this is an attribute of mod m\n   #[attr2] // no semi means this is an attribute of fn f\n   fn f() { }\n}\n```\n\nWhich is also how we distinguish crate attributes (semi-terminated attributes at the top of a .rc file apply to the 'containing' crate). I do want to change this syntax in a separate issue (#2569).\n\nI suggest for doc comments that we use doxygen's convention for specifying docs that come after the thing they document: `/**< */` and `///<`, so crate docs would look like\n\n```\n/**<\n\nThe Rust core library\n\n...\n*/\n```\n\nIt's unfortunate to have to distinguish between the two but not doing so would probably require much more subtle heuristics.\n\nSo here is an approximate plan of action:\n- Add a new lexer token to libsyntax/parse/token.rs called `DOC_COMMENT(str_num, ast::attr_style)`, where `str_num` is an index to an interned string containing the entire comment and `attr_style` indicates whether it's an inner or outer attribute.\n- Add a boolean to `ast::attribute_` in libsyntax/ast.rs indicating that the attribute is a sugared doc attribute.\n- Modify the lexer in libsyntax/parse/lexer.rs to emit doc comment tokens instead of passing over them as whitespace.\n- Mody attr parsing in libsyntax/parse/attr.rs to convert doc comment tokens to doc AST attributes.\n- Modify the pretty printer to understand doc comment attributes.\n\n> At this point rustdoc should automatically be extracting the doc comments from attributes, leaving all the decorating comment syntax (`///` etc) intact.\n- Add strip_comment_pass to rustdoc to run over all the documentation and strip out comment syntax bits.\n\n@Dretch hopefully this is enough to get started\n",
