  "body": "This appears to be causing the BSD bots to lock up when looking at the core\ndumps I've managed to get. Dropping the `FileDesc` structure triggers the `Arc`\nit's contained in to get cleaned up, invoking free(). This instead just closes\nthe file descriptor (the arc itself is never cleaned up).\n\nI'm still not entirely sure why this is a problem because the pthreads runtime\nshould register hooks for fork() to prevent this sort of deadlock, but perhaps\nthat's only done on linux?\n",
