    "body": "It should also present practical cases, where (sample(?)) Rust concepts are combined, like pattern matching nested enums with references(and mutability, ref keyword).\n\nOr how to design functions that take mutable arguments and immutable ones. As a beginner it took some time to figure out why I can't pass something mutable to something that requires something immutable since at first one might thing: Well, it doesn't get modified, so it should work... \n\nIn most cases you are able to find a simple example, but when combining them one gets beaten up by the compiler. This is just my experience as a newbie.\n\nIn summary, I think the common(or just in my case) newbie problem is, that you make assumptions that are simply not true when starting with Rust. \n\nBTW, I am willing to help, in case you need some \"Newbie-Perspective\".\n\nAh, another thing: Take care of those who come from VM-Lamguages like C# and Java....\n",
