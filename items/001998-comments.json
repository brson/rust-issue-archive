    "body": "My current thinking:\n1. Parse, get unexpanded, unconfigured AST\n2. Pull out everything cfg'd with the same name into sidetable\n3. Configure, expand.\n4. Pull out everything with the same name again.\n5. Run rest of `core`.\n\nThen, later, when cleaning, check if the item's nodeid is in the sidetable of cfg'd things. If so, add them to a vec of \"alternatives\" in the item, cleaning each.\n\nThis depends on:\n1. The AST never being renumbered. (I don't think this is true today? @pcwalton?)\n2. Holding onto a reference to the pre-expanded AST will cause that node to still be alive later on, but not otherwise affect the AST. (I think this is true today.)\n\nWhen rendered, we'd have a list of \"alternative definitions\", listing the cfg's that would have enabled them. This of course doesn't handle things that are _actually_ conditionally enabled/disabled, just things that are defined multiple times.\n",

Or maybe even more importantly, same function with different types, or same type with different public fields?\n\nOne possible solution might be to add a selector somewhere on the page that lets you pick the platform you wish to view, and it would use that to show the correct documentation/types/fields. It could still show AST elements that aren't available on that platform but perhaps greyed out, to indicate that they're not available.\n\nAnother solution is to do what @tomjakubowski suggested and just upload docs for each platform to a different path. The main rustdoc UI could then still have the selector, which changes the URL to view that platform's documentation (and sets a cookie that is used by the non-platform-specific documentation path to automatically jump to the platform-specific path). One downside to this is every documentation URL that people share would then be a platform-specific URL.\n",

    "body": "> One potential problem with trying to do the AST approach is if the same function/type is defined for multiple platforms with different doc comments, which doc comment do we show for the item?\n\nIn this case, I think we should emit a warning (that can be made into an error via a command line flag, to make this useful for CI or local testing, but still preserves compatibility) and just pick one (maybe the native one for compatibility). If only one of these item has docs, this is a non-issue (which should be the preferred way to document this IMO).\n\n> Or maybe even more importantly, same function with different types, or same type with different public fields?\n\nI'm not sure about what a type means to Rustdoc, but I don't think it uses type information. This would mean that at least type aliases are handled automatically: The type can be something like `libc::size_t`, which is defined to something different depending on platform, but still acts the same way.\n\nNow all remaining cases should be rare, so we could emit a warning for them as well. Which item we actually pick... no idea, maybe the same item we would pick today (like above).\n\nI could also imagine solving these 2 issues by just adding docs for both items and marking them with their cfg attribute (something that would be nice in any case).\n\n> How about building docs on all three supported platforms\n\nhttp://doc.rust-lang.org/libc is apparently doing that already, but it's not the best from a usability perspective, and I don't think `std` is doing the same, which is the whole reason I wrote this ;) (needed some Windows-specific trait, didn't find it, got annoyed at Rustdoc)\n",

    "body": "I've thought a bit about this recently, so i'll brain-dump into this issue in case anyone else is interested:\r\n\r\nI call this the \"holy grail\" of rustdoc, because all the ways i know of to scrape a crate for docs will hit against some kind of fundamental limitation. Using the compiler itself (like rustdoc currently does) or using `save-analysis` (like RLS and the pending rustdoc rewrite) requires you to build or partially build the item in question, forcing you to pick a target and lose all the `cfg`-tagged things that don't match it.\r\n\r\nSide-stepping the compiler and reading the raw source code yourself (i.e. going through `syn` or the like) gets you more information, but there's a serious road-block: anything to do with macros or build scripts. From what i've been told, macro expansion and conditional compilation happen at the same time, because one can affect the other. Therefore, it's not possible (at the moment, at least) to get the equivalent of `--pretty=expanded` without also processing `cfg` attributes. You're stuck either implementing macro expansion yourself as well or just ignoring anything that happens in a macro. Ditto for build scripts, which need you to go through cargo to properly build and execute it, and you're stuck in the same problem as before - you have to pick a target.\r\n\r\nTo do this with the do-it-yourself /`syn` approach, you'd need to scan the crate first to find any `cfg` attribute, see if you can parse what the attribute needs, pick a target that satisfies it, then run `--pretty=expanded` on the crate to get the `cfg`'d items specifically for that. Merge those in somehow with the \"base\" run (for the default target) and render *that*. Putting this in current rustdoc or in the analysis generation for RLS would require all of this to happen basically before anything else in the compilation flow.\r\n\r\nMy idea for surfacing these things in docs is to duplicate the item for each `cfg`, adding a marker to something indicating the contents of the attribute and showing each one in turn. That way, in case the docs for something is different for a given platform, you can see exactly which platform(s) it applies to. This can lead to some duplication or awkward formatting, especially with something like libc or anything that uses `cfg_if` to assemble complex conditional compilation setups. (`cfg_if` is a perfect example of macros and conditional compilation working together to make this really complicated.) For example, in `std::os`:\r\n\r\n> * `cfg(unix)` unix: Experimental extensions to `std` for Unix platforms.\r\n> * `cfg(windows)` windows: Experimental extensions to `std` for Windows.\r\n\r\nOr among the trait implementations for `File`:\r\n\r\n> * `cfg(unix)` `impl AsRawFd for File`\r\n>   * (contents of `unix::io::AsRawFd`...)\r\n>\r\n> (...)\r\n>\r\n> * `cfg(windows)` `impl AsRawHandle for File`\r\n>   * (contents of `windows::io::AsRawHandle`...)\r\n\r\n...on the other hand, this doesn't take into account doing something like `cfg_attr(unix, doc = \"something for unix\")`... `>_>` But it should get common cases.",

Definitions can vary (significantly) too.\r\n\r\nAnd what about modules?  For example, suppose we have:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[cfg(foo)]\r\npub mod host {\r\n    pub struct Foo(pub usize);\r\n\r\n    pub struct Bar;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[cfg(not(foo))]\r\npub mod host {\r\n    pub struct Foo(pub i8);\r\n\r\n    pub struct Qux;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn foo() -> host::Foo { host::Foo(0) }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre you saying we should arbitrarily choose one `mod host` for which we generate documentation, and ignore the other\u2014in which case either `host::Bar` or `host::Qux` will be entirely omitted (and we've not made much progress)?  Or do we merge these different module definitions to create a franken `mod host` in which we have both `host::Bar` and `host::Qux` but arbitrarily choose just one definition of `Foo`?\r\n\r\nOr do we generate separate documentation for both modules, in which case to what will the documentation for the (non-conditionally compiled) function `foo()` link for its return type?  Making an arbitrary choice here is, I think, even more confusing than the status quo.\r\n\r\nI think the only sensible options are as set out by @lilyball in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1998#issuecomment-125047075:\r\n\r\n> One possible solution might be to add a selector somewhere on the page that lets you pick the platform you wish to view, and it would use that to show the correct documentation/types/fields. It could still show AST elements that aren't available on that platform but perhaps greyed out, to indicate that they're not available.\r\n> \r\n> Another solution is to do what @tomjakubowski suggested and just upload docs for each platform to a different path. The main rustdoc UI could then still have the selector, which changes the URL to view that platform's documentation (and sets a cookie that is used by the non-platform-specific documentation path to automatically jump to the platform-specific path). One downside to this is every documentation URL that people share would then be a platform-specific URL.",

    "body": "Perhaps an intermediate solution would be to separately compile docs for each (crate-configurable, tier 1s by default) target platform, then perform a diff/merge on the results?  Indeed, rather than performing the diff/merge operation on HTML it could be time to add a more machine-readable output format to rustdoc and perform the operation on that?  JSON perhaps?\r\n\r\n*Edit* I see rustdoc had JSON output historically, but it was removed: #32698 contains some discussion around it.",

    "body": "Reading my comment from back then again, it seems fairly clear that it doesn't apply to the example given above:\r\n\r\n> > One potential problem with trying to do the AST approach is if the same function/type is defined for multiple platforms with different doc comments, which doc comment do we show for the item?\r\n>\r\n> In this case, I think we should emit a warning (that can be made into an error via a command line flag, to make this useful for CI or local testing, but still preserves compatibility) and just pick one (maybe the native one for compatibility).\r\n\r\nIt only concerns different versions of an item that both have *different documentation*, but @eggyal's example does not contain any documentation. This doesn't solve the issue with different item definitions depending on `#[cfg]` flags, of course.",
