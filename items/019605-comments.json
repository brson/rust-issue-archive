    "body": "Right now we're in the process of stabilizing the `std::io::fs` module, and I think that we may want to hold off on this for a few reasons at the moment:\n- The permissions model of `std::io::fs` will likely change to a more platform-agnostic model than permission bits as it's not really what Windows does (only unix).\n- In general we do not want to be calling MSVCRT functions but instead calling native Windows API functions.\n- We're moving away from Unix-centric names to more descriptive and Windows-friendly names, so this may not want to be called just `access`.\n\nFunctionality such as this is likely to be provided unconditionally as part of the `std::os::unix` module at some point (raw platform-specific APIs), but it will likely not live in `std::io::fs` as-is for now. While we're hammering out these issues with the API, I'm going to close this for now, but I'll be sure to cc you when we open the `std::io` RFC so you can comment! Thanks for the PR regardless!\n",
