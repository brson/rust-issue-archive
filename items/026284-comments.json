I suspect that examples such as the one described by @eddyb come up more often than you might think...\n\nAs a reference, @nikomatsakis went through a fair amount of future-proofing to lay the foundation for the the object defaults change in #26370 \n\nIn my gut, I'm inclined to recommend that we do the same here... i.e. that we adopt a strategy of first trying to detect cases that will eventually be errors and emit warnings for them in the short term.\n\nBut its possible others think that would be overkill.\n\ncc @rust-lang/lang \n",

    "body": "A couple of things:\n\n(1) I think this is good work, but this PR doesn't really go as far as I'd like. That is, I'd like to actually implement the zero-sized types change. Doing the work that this PR does is a good first step though. This change is (slightly) breaking in some cases.\n\n(2) I think we should definitely evaluate the impact; I am not 100% certain whether we should go forward with a warning period or what. Unlike the default object lifetime bounds, this work falls under the category of bug or soundness fix (in particular, issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/19925.) But of course this doesn't make much difference to the end-user experience if it causes your code to break. Probably it would be best to phase in the changes with a warning cycle, but at minimum we should ensure we get very clear error messages.\n",
