Or to be more precise, chasing the ghosts of [nanoseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_units_of_measurement#Light-nanosecond).\nI was seeing a lot of variation (more than the difference between old and new timings).\nTBQH I don't really like what we're doing with `#[bench]`.\nFor small things, it feels useless without a RTOS and CPU frequency pinning - we're not even using user time!\n\n[Turns out we generate the same IR](https://gist.github.com/eddyb/62f5d2e1cf22a9dc554b) - technically it differs, but only in ordering of the instructions.\nThe assembly is _identical_. Case closed.\n",
