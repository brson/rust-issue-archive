Is this something worth bothering with for now?\n\nI've been thinking about how to do this for a while now, and I think the best strategy is to have a hashmap of trait name -> deriving function stored in the ExtCtxt, and allow `phase(syntax)` things to add to this map. (I don't think the current deriving interface is good enough though, nor do I think that this needs to be done in this PR.)\n",

I've been having some discussions about this with @alexcrichton in a side-bar on PR #13948 and [on irc](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-internals/msg/14340428/)\n",
