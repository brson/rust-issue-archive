    "body": "A couple of cool things:\n- I managed only hit _one_ ICE while writing all this code. Either rust is getting stable or I'm subconciously trained to avoid particular patterns. I have a terrible memory, so I think rust is stabilizing! \n- This is some seriously heavy usage of the new `format!` syntax extension. I really enjoyed using it, although I could be biased... I'm seeing rays of light for an HTML formatting library which escapes everything by default, but I couldn't quite wrap my head around doing so.\n- The formatting of all the code into html templates is ugly as sin. This could seriously benefit from a formatting library.\n- I thought `include_str!` was cool\n\nRegardless, carry on!\n",

    "body": "Also, this would _seriously_ benefit from a markdown C library as opposed to forking off and executing pandoc. We're not really using any of pandoc's fancy extensions any more (except for all the tutorial/manual generation), so we're less attached to it now than before.\n\nThe reason it needs to be a C library is that instead of forking pandoc once per page, now it's once _per docblock_ which is _a lot_ more often. I've parallelized everything among a set number of workers, so it's not as bad as it could be, but it's still pretty bad.\n",
