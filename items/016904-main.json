  "body": "Issue can be reproduced by the following:\n\n```\n$ cat main.rs\nfn main() {}\n$ rustc -Z print-link-args -Lfoo -Lbar main.rs\n```\n\nRun the rustc command a few times and observe that the order of the '-L' 'foo' '-L' 'bar' options randomly changes.\n\nActually hit this issue in practice on Windows when specifying two -L directories to rustc, one with rust-sdl2 in it and one with the C SDL2.dll. Since Windows file systems aren't case-sensitive, gcc randomly attempted to link against the rust sdl2.dll instead of SDL2.dll if that -L directory happened to come first.\n\nThe randomness was due to addl_lib_search_paths being a HashSet. Changed it to a Vec instead which maintains the ordering.\nUnsure how to test this though since it is random by nature; suggestions very welcome.\n",
