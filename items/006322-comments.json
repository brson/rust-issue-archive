Additionally, the `#[start]` function can be prototyped as:\n\n``` rust\n#[start] fn start(argc: int, argv: **u8) -> int { ... }\n```\n\nWhich is kind of what one would expect. @brson, I'm not entirely certain what the motivations of this issue were beyond achieving these two goals, so I'm hesitant to close this. From my understanding of this, it sounds pretty done to me though.\n",
