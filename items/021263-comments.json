    "body": "As far as I see it, there are two options: we either put `RangeFull` in the prelude and desugar to `RangeFull` or we don't and we desugar to `::core::ops::RangeFull`, both are equally easy to implement, the former is the current implementation. Note that we can't make `RangeFull` a lang item because we desugar in the parser, not later in the compiler (there is an issue for making lang items available in libsyntax, but I can't find it right now and it's a fair bit of work, so unlikely to be done soon).\n\nFor most users the two approaches are identical. Not having anything in the prelude is an advantage of the second approach.\n\nThe difference is for users who aren't using the prelude. Off the bat, the former approach does not work, and the latter one does (assuming they are using libcore). If they are not using libcore, then under the second approach, they are screwed (they could I guess create their own lib called `core` with `ops` in it and a `RangeFull` struct in that, but that kind of sucks).\n\nWithout a prelude, users would have to provide a `RangeFull` struct in scope, presumably with an import in each file. This is sub-optimal, but it does work even if they are not using libcore.\n\nFinally, there is the overriding case. The first approach allows users to override `RangeFull` with their own struct, whereas the second approach does not. (Because only prelude items can be shadowed). However, since we don't use the struct for anything other than a place holder, I don't really see any benefit of overriding it.\n\nOn balance, it seems that the second approach is slightly better, the only people it really sucks for are those running without libcore. Do we expect that to be a sizeable group or not?\n",

    "body": "And another thought: approach 2 is easier to future proof - I'm not exactly clear on how the stability stuff would work here, but could we mark `RangeFull` as unstable? We would allow stable use only via the range syntax, and one day when we have libsyntax lang items, we could make it a lang item, rather than hard coded. I guess this would not work for people implementing slicing who have to use `RangeFull` in their impls.\n\nPerhaps, even if we mark it stable, we could still change to using a lang item in the future without breaking anyone's code, so it is backwards compatible? Whereas approach 1 would be backwards incompatible because users could rely on it being in the prelude.\n",

    "body": "So, I implemented this (expand to `::core::ops::RangeFull`. One downside I had not anticipated is that now every crate has to `extern crate core` so that `core` is in scope. Are we OK with that? Alternatively, we could re-export RangeFull from std, but then expanding to `::std::ops::RangeFull` would fail for anyone building `no_std` (including a bunch of our libs).\n\nAny other ideas?\n",
