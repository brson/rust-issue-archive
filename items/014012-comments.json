    "body": "So I was looking at that screenshot and was wondering how to make it shorter since it is very verbose esp. when it appears repeatedly.  \nWhile I was originally thinking of a circled 'R' letter, I think we could rather use an icon set out in grey, [like this one](http://fontawesome.io/icon/refresh/)? It could be individually embedded in CSS to avoid any additional HTTP request.\n\nSomething else: do we want to add some margin before the text so that we can set the marker aside? (So that lines with reexported marker line up with those that don't have it)\n",
