    "body": "Closing as working as intended.\n\nThis is the unfortunate part of predominately using globs, you don't understand what functions you're pulling in from which modules, and then they start to stomp over one another. There is a `replace` function in the `util` module with a different signature than the one in the `str` module, which is why you're getting this error.\n\nI would recommend avoiding glob imports and instead referencing functions through the module instead (`str::replace` and `util::replace`)\n",
