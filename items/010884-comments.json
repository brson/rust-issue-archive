This is why we require that `use` statements appear before other items (like modules), to signify that the binding of a name is the first thing you find when you look upwards in the file.\n\nThat being said, the idea of having a warning about this is interesting. I personally would not want the lint to be warn-by-default, and allow-by-default lints have questionable usefulness when their purpose is to catch a possible bug like this, but the idea may be worth exploring.\n",

Of course, globs aren't finished yet (and might not be sticking around at all), so that point could well moot.\n\nThere is also the warn-by-default unused_import for use statements that could be but aren't used. `use` statements that can't _ever_ be used seem to be 'worse' to me.\n\nBut that's just my 2 pence.\n",

Resolve could keep a history of shadowed items and attempt to resolve through all shadowed items, providing a suggestion that perhaps you didn't mean to shadow when an error occurs.\n\nFor now though, everything is working as intended. I think that a different bug should be opened for improving error messages of resolve.\n",
