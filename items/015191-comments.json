    "body": "I think this patch may have only addressed the vtable part of #5781. There is another half, namely in [librustc/middle/typeck/infer/combine.rs#L92](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/typeck/infer/combine.rs#L92), it is still contravariant only for self type. IIRC, if we do fix it, then bivariant weirdness starts to creep in. That's what [rfc#12](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/12) is for, but now that rfc hasn't made progress for a while.\n\nAs for the new `compile-fail/variance-trait-matching-2.rs`, I believe it is the same as #12470 and has been fixed as a side effect of #14869. And the #12470 itself has been closed by my #15120 and your #15154, twice :D\n",

    "body": "This has had a few \"surprising\" consequences. Consider the following code\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo: Clone {}\n\nimpl Foo for fn(&int) {}\n\nfn foo(_: &int) {}\n\nfn main() {\n    foo.clone();\n}\n```\n\nThis compiles fine with 9f8149e185fe55751b8d8675021d2066249abe54 (before this landed), but fails with 1e6b69977a1d1b0e9295b7561491e2a863f7d221 (the version currently on the playpen): http://is.gd/qkFy3n\n\n```\n<anon>:3:1: 3:25 error: failed to find an implementation of trait core::clone::Clone for fn(&int)\n<anon>:3 impl Foo for fn(&int) {}\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n```\n\nOf particular note is that commenting out the `impl Foo` line makes it compile, that is, the `.clone()` call is fine despite the compiler complaining that that type doesn't implement `Clone`!\n\n---\n\nThere's another example where trait impls like\n\n``` rust\nimpl<\n    'a,\n    T: HasTransform<'a, Matrix2d>\n        + CanTransform<'a, T, Matrix2d>\n> RelativeTransform2d<'a> for T {\n    fn trans(&'a self, x: Scalar, y: Scalar) -> T {\n```\n\ncannot be used like:\n\n``` rust\npub struct Context<'a> { ... }\n\nfn foo() {\n    let c = Context::new();\n    {\n        let d = c.trans(20.0, 40.0);\n        let _d = d.trans(10.0, 10.0);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nbecause the `d.trans` call _needs_ the `&'a self` lifetime to match that of the `Context` in `c`, but the scope of `d` is too small. Previously I guess the subtyping meant that `c` the lifetime could be restricted, but this patch disables that. (@bvssvni is working on narrowing down a smaller example.)\n\n(I'm not suggesting at all that this patch should be reverted, just listing two corner-cases people have met due to this, for the record.)\n",
