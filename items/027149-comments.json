    "body": "@SimonSapin from reading the dialogue on #23848, it seems like the purpose of that PR shifted over time: at first it was turning off doc-generation for a broad class of crates, both the compiler-internal ones and the ones hidden behind the `std`-facade.\n\nBut it was determined that turning off doc-generation for the crates behind the `std`-facade caused links to break, so that doc-generation was turned back on.\n\nSo, the end net result of #23848 (if you count the backout commit that landed later) seems to be just to turn off doc generation for the compiler crates alone, I think?\n",
