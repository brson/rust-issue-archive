    "body": "This is a fundamental requirement of the traits; you can \"add\" methods to a type anywhere (including in different compilation units (\"crates\")), and so we need a way to make sure that we don't have name conflicts if two traits have methods of the same name and are implemented for a single type. To this end, a method from a trait is namespaced with the trait, rather than the types it is implemented on, so calling such a method requires importing the trait.\n\nThat said, it is a poor UX to just say that there's no such method, when the compiler does have enough information to be able to scan through all traits looking for methods with the appropriate name (at the very least) and preferably filtering to just traits that the current type implements. This has actually already been proposed in https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/7643, and so I'm going to close this issue as a dupe.\n\nThanks for taking the time to report this. :)\n",
