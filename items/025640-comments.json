Consider whether you spend as much effort noticing and correcting \"default male\" language you encounter. Or, if you could live with the original pronouns in this text, consider whether you can also make peace with the new ones.\n\nI also object to the omnibus fashion in which this change is being proposed. In my view, the decision about on whether to use chopsticks instead of forks, which I may agree is an improvement, is completely orthogonal to the decision to use neutral pronouns. If this was code instead of documentation, I suspect the maintainers would ask that each change you\u2019re proposing be split into a separate pull request so that they could be considered independently.\n",

    "body": "@sferik Most of the reason I chose singular \"they\" was for consistency, since that's what the rest of the article uses. Changing to using feminine pronouns for the philosophers requires a bit more work to go through the whole thing, and make sure I'm only replacing uses of singular \"they\" as opposed to uses in which it's actually used in aggregate. I think I did that appropriately in my most recent version of the branch, please give it a look.\n\n@pnkfelix I am pretty sure that @sferik meant that \"she\" should be used any place in which an unspecified philosopher was being discussed. When referring to a non-specific person, every choice of pronoun will be marked on at least one feature; if you use either \"he\" or \"she\", you are not matching the neutral gender inherent to the nature of an unspecified person, but you're matching on the features of number and animacy. If you use \"they\", you are matching the neutral gender and animacy, but not number. If you use \"it\", you are matching on number and gender, but not animacy. Not matching on animacy is generally considered to be ungrammatical, but any of the three other options are grammatical, and they each are marked on one feature, so there is no particularly good reason, grammatically, to choose one over the other; it is a stylistic choice.  \"He or she\" covers both linguistic possibilities, but it is quite clumsy to work into many sentences.\n\nMuch prescriptive style advice over the past couple of centuries has preferred \"he\", even though singular \"they\" has been widely used for a long time. To help overcome many years of presuming a particular gender, then, it can be valuable to choose \"she\" instead, to balance out the many years of use of \"he\" which may lead to cognitive biases in that direction.\n\nFor that reason, I've updated it to use \"she\" for the cases in which we're discussing an unspecified philosopher.\n",

These references could be added back without changing the wording of the example.\n\n> Switching the philosophers to ancient Greeks has its own set of problems. I chose the philosophers I did as a subtle nudge towards a body of work that more programmers should be aware of generally.\n\nAssuming Lao refers to [Laozi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi), he was not Greek.\n\nAssuming Simone refers to [Simone de Beauvoir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir) (or possibly [Simone Weil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil)), she was neither Greek nor ancient.\n\nAnd assuming Audre refers to [Audre Lorde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audre_Lorde), again, neither Green nor ancient.\n\nIf the goal is to expose programmers to new ideas, I\u2019d speculate that the work for Audre Lorde is much less widely known than the philosophers in your original example.\n\n> Using he/she still perpetuates a gender binary, which is exclusionary to trans folk to some degree.

Of course, this is not true of all transgender people, and more broadly, genderqueer people. My intent was not to be exclusive of any group.\n\nI have some points to make in response to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25650 but I have refrained from commenting there, since @pnkfelix requested that the conversation be moved to the [thread on internals](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/diversity-on-the-governance-teams/2048/120).

But including this seminal paper, and eventually adding a channels implementation, remains very important to me.\n\nThat is something that I didn't know when submitting this PR. As it is, it seemed like an odd choice for inclusion given the use of Mutexes rather than channels to solve the problem.\n\n> 1. Switching the philosophers to ancient Greeks has its own set of problems. I chose the philosophers I did as a subtle nudge towards a body of work that more programmers should be aware of generally.\n\nOnly two of my set of five philosophers were Greek, Plato and Hypatia. Beyond that there was Lao (Tzu; perhaps I should have used the Laozi form instead to make it more clear) of Tao Te Ching fame, Simone (de Beauvoir), and Audre (Lorde). I chose to use a single name for each of them for symmetry with the Greek names and to make it a little bit more casual, but they were also chosen as subtle nudges towards things that programmers might need to know a little more about. I appreciate the reasons for your choice of philosophers, but it is a bit homogenous.\n\n> 1. Using he/she still perpetuates a gender binary, which is exclusionary to trans folk to some degree. This was brought up in another ticket, and frankly, is part of why I suggested to use they in the original PR, but with all the heartbreak over this last week, I just didn't have it in me to argue. Generally speaking, we use 'they' in documentation when referring to pronouns, if not, that's a bug, as I said in the original ticket.\n\nUsing \"they\" is generally my default mode of writing as well, and I think it's a good standard to have; in fact, that's what I used in my original pull request (perhaps I should push all of the older versions of the branch as separate branches so you can see them, I've updated it several times in response to comments).\n\nHowever, I am quite sensitive to the issues brought up by @sferik and @skade; that there's an overwhelming gender imbalance in this project as a whole, and in a lot of language surrounding existing discussion of this topic. Correctly or incorrectly, people have seen Rust as \"that kind\" of open source project, based on looking at the team roster, and it doesn't get much better if you look at the contributor list as a whole. I do think that that can warrant at least a little bit of pressure to try and tip the scale in the other direction. It's a small thing, and only one of many, but I do think that specifically including at least a few explicitly feminine pronouns in the documentation can help make it feel a little bit more inclusive.\n\nMany trans people participate in the gender binary, preferring masculine or feminine pronouns. While there are some non-binary, neutrois, gender neutral, and agender folks out there, they are not, to my knowledge, under-represented in the way that 50% of the population, perhaps 20% of software developers, is represented as only single digit percentage of contributors, at least based on my reading of the [contributors page](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/graphs/contributors) and recent contributors lists for releases (and basing my judgement on gendered names in handles, gendered real names, and gender presentation in icons). And I think that we have plenty of documentation using the neutral \"they\"; this ticket is only touching a single example of five particular fictionalized philosophers.\n\n> So, what I suggest is this:\n> 1. Leave Hoare in.\n> 2. Change all pronouns to they, and use [they] in the quotation.\n> 3. Swap Spinoza for Judith Butler.\n\nThat would be easing up a little bit on the all-male language in the quote, and all-male example. I don't think that it would be applying any pressure against the weight of the current demographics and historical use of language in this area, which was part of the point of my pull request (and @sferik's).\n\nI don't believe that the language in documentation is the most important way of putting pressure on the other end of the scale; it is but one tool of many. It can help in its own way, but it's probably not worth spending too much more time on.\n\nI'll push one last update to change Lao to Laozi to make it a little more clear; if you would prefer to take the steps you listed, we should probably just close this pull request and you can apply that change, it's far enough from the spirit of this PR that it would be better done as a new one.\n",

    "body": "I'm having difficulty following this conversation in its particulars, but it seems to me that in some comments a distinction has not been made between two distinct concepts: a) a pronoun referring to a person of unknown gender, b) a pronoun referring to any person who is a member of a set of people for whom at least some genders are known. It seems appropriate to me to use `they` or `she` to designate a) for the reasons that have been stated above, and I think reasonable people can differ about which is preferable. However, it would be inappropriate to use `she` in a case of b) in which the set includes people with known non-`she` pronouns. Put in terms of types, `she` is an appropriate designation for the pronoun type `_`, but not for the pronoun type `T | U`.\n\nI would also strongly suggest singular `they` over `he/she` or `he or she` or `(s)he` or any similar conjoining of `he` and `she`, even in referring to a set whose members' pronouns are all known to be `he` or `she`, because of the history of erasure of nonbinary gender identities.\n\n> While there are some non-binary, neutrois, gender neutral, and agender folks out there, they are not, to my knowledge, under-represented in the way that 50% of the population, perhaps 20% of software developers, is represented as only single digit percentage of contributors\n\nMaybe do not try to determine a [hierarchy of oppressions](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~jc3962/COR/Hierarchy.pdf).

    "body": "@lambda, first of all, thank you for this PR, and for that last comment. \n\nWhile I can see the value of positive discrimination, and am generally in favor, in this case, there are a few different things at play. While it's true that there are many strategies for dealing with pronouns, singular 'they' has a number of advantages. It's maximally inclusive in terms of groups, it's the most accurate in that it leaves the gender undefined, and it's simple to enforce as a rule.  Choosing 'she' as a means of positive discrimination has some merit, for sure, but I think that it introduces procedural drawbacks, as well as focuses on _one_ aspect of diversity over all others, which isn't inherently bad, but everything comes at a cost, you know?\n\nGiven all of these different factors, sticking with `they` as the proper pronoun to use in these situations feels like the right call to me. \n\n>  if you would prefer to take the steps you listed, we should probably just close this pull request and you can apply that change, it's far enough from the spirit of this PR that it would be better done as a new one.\n\nIf that's what you'd like, sure. I plan on doing the following in the next few minutes:\n1. Double-checking that all of our documentation uses 'they'\n2. moving this quote to use `[they]`.\n3. changing up the gender balance of said philosophers\n4. Later, adding a channels-based implementation to strengthen the connection between the paper and the text itself.\n\nThis discussion has been hard, but thank you all so much for caring about diversity in Rust. It's really important to me that everyone that wants to use Rust feels able to do so.\n",
