When you say that the workarounds are non-obvious, could you elaborate more?\n\nI'm not too, too worried about the `fmodf` and `fmod` symbols. I don't currently have a plan to fix them, and I figure that if your platform doesn't have floating point support then you can just define two dummy symbols with these names that just fail if you call them. The only real solution I can think of is to have a separate crate which owns floats (so you can define libcore traits on floats).\n",

When you say that the workarounds are non-obvious, could you elaborate more?\n\nI documented this issue at https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core#freestanding-usage along with filing a bug report about it. Even with the bug fixed, I think these would be best in an optional crate to allow using the system functions. LLVM is surprisingly good at generating code for these via `loop-vectorize` and out-performed glibc when I last tested, because it wasn't using AVX yet. It's possible things have changed since then.\n",
