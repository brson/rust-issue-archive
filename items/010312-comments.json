    "body": "From what I could tell, it looked like LLVM pretty much fully supported this on all platforms that LLVM supports. We'll never be able to support a platform that LLVM doesn't, so my own worries about this not necessarily working everywhere were alleviated after learning this.\n\nI personally really like this because it solves the static initialization problem, and primarily for that reason. I suppose that this could get a little weird if you're using `thread_local` in an environment without a dynamic linker, but in those environments I think that people are mostly aware enough to not use thread local things.\n\nI'm still a little wary of this not being supported on windows yet. We're not only exporting this for the runtime, but also for the language as a whole. I don't think that we quite have a roadmap for migrating to mingw64 soon, so I'm not sure that we should commit to this until we have a plan for getting this to work on windows as well.\n\nI believe that this is a lot faster than the current scheme, but I'm not entirely convinced that it's necessary to speed up these lookups. If it is the case that we see a huge improvement in runtime-related benchmark, then there may be more of an impetus for this, and perhaps in that situation we shouldn't have a `thread_local` annotation, but rather a `this_is_the_runtime_tls_key` annotation.\n",
