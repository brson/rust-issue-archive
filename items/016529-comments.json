    "body": "I'm somewhat inclined to think we could just remove the built-in indexing from `&[T]` entirely and thus remove/reduce the need for the special lang-items, although there's at least three considerations:\n- the failure message for out-of-bounds indexing would be less informative (no file/line information), but debugging any other `fail!` (e.g. `Option.unwrap`) already requires a debugger to get this info, so maybe it's not so bad.\n- `[T, .. n]` can't yet implement `Index` properly, so this would still need built-in support with `[]` (and thus the out-of-bounds failure lang items can't be entirely removed just yet), unless implicit coercions will work.\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/12825 needs to be fixed before `IndexMut` will work properly (and I guess DST would make it work more nicely).\n\nUsers would theoretically not see a change, since this would all happen inside `std` (and `core`).\n",
