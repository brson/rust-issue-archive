    "body": "Thanks for looking into this! You can see some related work in the past here as well: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/14574. I believe the conclusion there was that these operations would generate new inference variables instead of the bottom type (see more here as well https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14973).\n\nThat being said I do like having ICEs fixed for now. @nikomatsakis do you have an opinion on waiting for #14973 being dealt with first or whether this should land in the meantime for dealing with the ICE?\n",
