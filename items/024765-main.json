  "body": "Inspect enum discriminant _after_ calling its destructor\n\nIncludes some drive-by cleanup (e.g. changed some field and method names to reflect fill-on-drop; added comments about zero-variant enums being classified as `_match::Single`).\n\nProbably the most invasive change was the expansion of the maps `available_drop_glues` and `drop_glues` to now hold two different kinds of drop glues; there is the (old) normal drop glue, and there is (new) drop-contents glue that jumps straight to dropping the contents of a struct or enum, skipping its destructor.\n- For all types that do not have user-defined Drop implementations, the normal glue is generated as usual (i.e. recursively dropping the fields of the data structure).\n  \n  (And this actually is exactly what the newly-added drop-contents glue does as well.)\n- For types that have user-defined Drop implementations, the \"normal\" drop glue now schedules a cleanup before invoking the `Drop::drop` method that will call the drop-contents glue after that invocation returns.\n\nFix #23611.\n\n---\n\nIs this a breaking change?  The prior behavior was totally unsound, and it seems unreasonable that anyone was actually relying on it.\n\nNonetheless, since there is a user-visible change to the language semantics, I guess I will conservatively mark this as a:\n\n[breaking-change]\n\n(To see an example of what sort of user-visible change this causes, see the comments in the regression test.)\n",
