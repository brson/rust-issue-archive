    "body": "Looks like a bug in `clean.mk`.\n\nWe build compilers that run on 'host' triples, so for each host triple we must have an llvm - we don't need an llvm for 'target' triples, and in fact should not build one for targets that are not hosts - not all targets may be capable of running llvm.\n\nThe problem here is that `clean.mk` defines [clean rules](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/mk/clean.mk#L145) for all hosts, but then goes on to try to [invoke them](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/mk/clean.mk#L22) for all targets. The solution is probably to fix the latter to only invoke `clean` on host triples.\n\nThis is the same issue addressed by https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7492\n\n@Thad for your purposes, since you are trying to create a compiler for x86_64 from an i686 host, you probably want to configure with `--host-triples=i686-pc-mingw,x86_64-whatever`, producing two complete compilers.\n",
