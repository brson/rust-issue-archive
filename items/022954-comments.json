The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @steveklabnik (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

I haven't reviewed the diff yet, but I love getting huge descriptions.\n\nThat being said, it's also very hard to manage big ones with unrelated changes like this ,so feel free to open individual ones in the future, as they tend to be much easier to handle, since we can handle them peacemeal. The cherry-picking thing is true, but since @bors can't do that automatically, in our case, it's a significantly more work.\n\nOn to the diff!\n",

    "body": "Well, there are pain points all over. Follow [reddit/rust](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/) and they're discussed frequently. Of course there are [doc bugs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-docs).\n\nLifetimes questions constantly come up (awesome lifetime docs would be really great!). Partially because there is a lack of clear documentation but also because it's unclear what awesome lifetime docs will look like. See [here](http://users.rust-lang.org/t/what-needs-to-be-explained-about-lifetime-parameters/291/2) for examples and links to perplexed readers.\n\nClosures were a problem (mainly outdated because closures just changed a lot) but it looks like @steveklabnik is about to make them a bit better with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23568 .\n\nMaking one cohesive document which handles people of all backgrounds proves problematic. Systems programmers don't like the simple things explained. Non-systems guys don't them glossed. Deep type language tends to be used by developers which can cause problems until simpler docs are written: see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22914\n\nDocs are still a moving target, but it's getting better. Compiler breaking old Rust is decreasing and this makes things a lot easier. Also check out [rbe](http://rustbyexample.com/) if you haven't seen it. It's not prominently advertised on the main site.\n",
