  "body": "Enable parallel codegen (2 units) by default when --opt-level is 0 or 1.  This\ngives a minor speedup on large crates (~10%), with only a tiny slowdown (~2%)\nfor small ones (which usually build in under a second regardless).  The current\ndefault (no parallelization) is used when the user requests optimization\n(--opt-level 2 or 3), and when the user has enabled LTO (which is incompatible\nwith parallel codegen).\n\nThis commit also changes the rust build system to use parallel codegen\nwhen appropriate.  This means codegen-units=4 for stage0 always, and\nalso for stage1 and stage2 when configured with --disable-optimize.\n(Other settings use codegen-units=1 for stage1 and stage2, to get\nmaximum performance for release binaries.)  The build system also sets\ncodegen-units=1 for compiletest tests (compiletest does its own\nparallelization) and uses the same setting as stage2 for crate tests.\n\nr? @aturon\n",
