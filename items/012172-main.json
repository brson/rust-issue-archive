  "body": "These commits pick off some low-hanging fruit which were slowing down spawning green threads. The major speedup comes from fixing a bug in stack caching where we never used any cached stacks!\n\nThe program I used to benchmark is at the end. It was compiled with `rustc --opt-level=3 bench.rs --test` and run as `RUST_THREADS=1 ./bench --bench`. I chose to use `RUST_THREADS=1` due to #11730 as the profiles I was getting interfered too much when all the schedulers were in play (and shouldn't be after #11730 is fixed). All of the units below are in ns/iter as reported by `--bench` (lower is better).\n\n|  | green | native | raw |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| osx before | 12699 | 24030 | 19734 |\n| linux before | 10223 | 125983 | 122647 |\n| osx after | 3847 | 25771 | 20835 |\n| linux after | 2631 | 135398 | 122765 |\n\nNote that this is _not_ a benchmark of spawning green tasks vs native tasks. I put in the native numbers just to get a ballpark of where green tasks are. This is benchmark is _clearly_ benefiting from stack caching. Also, OSX is clearly not 5x faster than linux, I think my VM is just much slower.\n\nAll in all, this ended up being a nice 4x speedup for spawning a green task when you're using a cached stack.\n\n``` rust\nextern mod extra;\nextern mod native;\nuse std::rt::thread::Thread;\n\n#[bench]\nfn green(bh: &mut extra::test::BenchHarness) {\n    let (p, c) = SharedChan::new();\n    bh.iter(|| {\n        let c = c.clone();\n        spawn(proc() {\n            c.send(());\n        });\n        p.recv();\n    });\n}\n\n#[bench]\nfn native(bh: &mut extra::test::BenchHarness) {\n    let (p, c) = SharedChan::new();\n    bh.iter(|| {\n        let c = c.clone();\n        native::task::spawn(proc() {\n            c.send(());\n        });\n        p.recv();\n    });\n}\n\n#[bench]\nfn raw(bh: &mut extra::test::BenchHarness) {\n    bh.iter(|| {\n        Thread::start(proc() {}).join()\n    });\n}\n```\n",
