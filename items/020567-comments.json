If it looks and acts like a dog then its better to call it a dog than any other name imho.\n\nAs for to put it in the guide or not, well I haven't been around here long enough to make a quality call on something like that. However I will say that I personally expected to see something on it in there because the guide has been my gold standard so far. It also covers what I'd describe as \"day to day\" usage, which I think matrices are for a lot of people.\n",

The components of such an array may contain references to subarrays. If, starting from any array type, one considers its component type, and then (if that is also an array type) the component type of that type, and so on, eventually one must reach a component type that is not an array type; this is called the element type of the original array, and the components at this level of the data structure are called the elements of the original array.\n\nSome kind of readable variation of this?\n",
