    "body": "OK, I've taken a look at this. The implementation looks very good. I've added some comments to the test cases. Also, a test case with static enums would be a good idea. If you address the nits and add an enum test case, the PR has my blessing.\n\nIt's strange that we always need to specify the variables' full path. With Clang and GDB specifying just the name works fine, but I couldn't find a significant difference in the DWARF generated for both. Maybe GDB's 'minimal language' is evaluated slightly different than C++. I looked into it more than an hour but couldn't solve the problem. But this should be of no concern for this PR.\n\nExcellent work! Thanks a lot for putting your time into this.\n",
