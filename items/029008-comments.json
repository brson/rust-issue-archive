    "body": "Thanks @alexcrichton for taking care of the hash issue -- it's an interesting footgun with derive.\n\nRegarding the semantic/normalization issues: there's definitely disagreement with the docs here, which is bad (and indicates insufficient unit testing). The question about trailing `/` is particularly interesting, since we explored a few different normalization approaches and ended up only being sensitive to a (semantic) extra `.` in the front of the path (see https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/index.html#normalization).\n\nIn any case, I agree that the behavior here is counterintuitive and there are cases where you want trailing `/` sensitivity; I think it was probably a mistake to normalize the trailing slash away.\n\nIf the APIs weren't stable, I'd suggest treating `foo/` and `foo/.` as if they have a trailing \"current directory\" component, which is currently normalized away. That would mean that `.` is significant when leading or trailing, but not when embedded. It would mean that `foo/` and `foo/.` are equal, and that neither is equal to `foo`. And it would mean that `file_name` would return `None` for these cases.\n\nThe behavior of `pop` on `..` just seems like an outright bug to me.\n\nAll that said, I'm not sure what's best to do given the stable status of these APIs. We should definitely discuss this at the next libs team meeting.\n",

    "body": "Just focusing on the trailing slash aspect of this issue.\n\nSome notes on using `basename`/`filename`, i.e. \"get the final component\":\n- Python 2 and C++ (boost 1.59) treats a trailing slash as implying an empty component\n- Posix (the [posix basename command](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695299/utilities/basename.html), i.e. coreutils and the [posix function by the same name](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/basename.html) i.e. the C api), tcl 8.5, ruby 2.2, nodejs 5, java 1.8, PHP 5.6 and Go all ignore trailing slash.\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I think treating trailing slashes as meaningful in terms of components is probably outvoted (especially since this behaviour is stable).\nThis wouldn't be a problem if there was a decent way to work with OsStrings (\"get me the last character of this path\") - `Path::new` is not lossy (not sure about `PathBuf`), so as long as the library (or wherever you get the path from) isn't doing split+join, you'd still be able to check for the trailing slash if you really wanted to. Sadly, I have not found OsString manipulation easy.\n\nSo: document trailing slashes being ignored as part of `components` and (someday) make OsString easier to work with?\n\n---\n\nPython 2:\n\n```\n>>> import os.path\n>>> os.path.basename('/a/b/c')\n'c'\n>>> os.path.basename('/a/b/c/')\n''\n```\n\nC++ (boost 1.59):\n\n```\n    boost::filesystem::path p1(\"/a/b/c\");\n    boost::filesystem::path p2(\"/a/b/c/\");\n    cout << p1.filename() << \"\\n\" << p2.filename();\n```\n\n```\nc\n.\n```\n\n---\n\nTcl 8.5\n\n```\n% llength [file split /a/b/c]\n4\n% llength [file split /a/b/c/]\n4\n```\n\nRuby 2.2\n\n```\n   Pathname.new(\"/a/b/c\").basename\n=> #<Pathname:c>\n   Pathname.new(\"/a/b/c/\").basename\n=> #<Pathname:c>\n```\n\nNodejs 5\n\n```\n> path.basename('/a/b/c');\n'c'\n> path.basename('/a/b/c/');\n'c'\n```\n\nJava 1.8\n\n```\n    System.out.println(Paths.get(\"/a/b/c\").getFileName());\n    System.out.println(Paths.get(\"/a/b/c/\").getFileName());\n[...]\nc\nc\n```\n\nPHP 5.6\n\n```\necho basename(\"/a/b/c\") . \" \" . basename(\"/a/b/c/\");\n[...]\nc c\n```\n\nGo\n\n> Base returns the last element of path.
