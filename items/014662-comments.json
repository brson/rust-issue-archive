    "body": "@alexcrichton Putting them in `$prefix/lib` doesn't seem worse than the situation now, where we are already using that directory. The only concern I see there is if we were to appropriate `rustlib` as a sort of GAC that cargo also uses to install libraries, in which case we probably would not want to just throw them into `$prefix/lib`, but split the rust host libs across `$prefix/lib` and `$prefix/lib/rustlib`.\n\nFWIW, I expect this to be solved as part of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/11145, but restructuring the bootstrap seems pretty far out of scope at the moment. @alexcrichton are you thinking that we would sort of reorganize the artifacts on installation, but not for the bootstrap?\n",

    "body": "Yeah I do think that https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/11145 would solve this if we tackled it. I suppose my worry now about `$prefix/lib` is that lots of libs are installed there, and if we added a usual `-L` to it we may pick up some extra ones unintentionally.\n\nI suppose we could reorganize for installation but not for bootstrap, but I do agree that it would be a little confusing. If we were to do this near-term, I would propose something like:\n1. Replace all stage1 artifacts with stage2 artifacts.\n2. Remove all stage2 artifacts in `$prefix/lib` from `$prefix/lib/rustlib/$target/lib`.\n3. Implicitly add `$prefix/lib` to the set of `-L` paths.\n\nThis would allow us to deduplicate our distribution strategy (only distributing one set of artifacts) and would be roughly equivalent to what the bootstrap process looks like today, just not exactly so.\n",
