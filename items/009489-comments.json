It's true that there are more clicks, but we do have a search bar and a sidebar navigation to find things.\n\nBasically, if it looks like the majority opinion is that it needs more content per page, then we should do that, otherwise it may be worth sticking to what exists (or at least this is my best summary).\n",

    "body": "@kud1ing First of all I have to say that it is probably a very subjective thing, so I don't expect everyone to agree with me on this, and I don't expect I will be able to convince you, but I will try to explain my point of view at least.\n\nI recognize the small issue of navigating from item to item, sure it can be a bit easier to scroll through the whole page, but on the other hand if you want to get back to the list of links on top you also have to hit \"back\" in some form, so the benefit isn't so huge compared to individual pages.\n\nOn the other hand, the benefits I see to individual pages are: \n- more focus on what you're currently looking at, it's not lost in a sea of definitions. \n- once the docs are (hopefully) a bit more complete and contain examples etc for most things, one individual element page will be already pretty long, and having it all in one will make it pretty much impossible to easily scan through I think.\n- shorter pages so the sidebar/list of neighbors usually stays in focus or near focus. On your D docs example for example once you scroll you quickly get very far from useful sidebar links.\n- less intimidating and confusing pages (kind of goes together with focus). That might be completely subjective, but I really find it easier to navigate through sidebar links to neighbor elements, or via the linked types (which is now much better. most things were not linked previously, forcing you to navigate by hand).\n\nSo all in all, I think between search and sidebar and type hyperlinks you have a lot more options to navigate easily and I find this superior to smashing everything on one page because navigation is hard. I just hope you'll give it a chance and hopefully see it's also a good model, but if ultimately most people dislike it we can obviously go back, it's not the hardest thing to change.\n",

    "body": "Regarding the ascii example, in theory going to http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/ascii/struct.Ascii.html should list everything you can do with it. AsciiStr methods aren't listed for example, but that's a bug IMO. The AsciiStr page lists `impl<'self> AsciiStr for &'self [Ascii]` as an implementor, so ideally it should show up on the Ascii page. It's maybe not trivial to fix though.\n\nI was a newcomer recently and still am in many ways, but I found the long pages pretty awful for discoverability, I always got lost in the long lists of similar sounding functions and various impls. That's why I started working on the new docs, and put a focus on links & search which I think allow discoverability much more than \"oh I found this by chance\". If I want to find something I usually have a remote idea of how it could be called, but I don't necessarily know in which module it could be.\n",

I'd just like to give it some time and see because I feel it's something that is bound to trigger resistance when it changes but people will hopefully grow used to it (and maybe even like it). Maybe I'm wrong though :) \n\nAs for the \"can't we get both?\", maybe. I just don't see how to make it happen sanely, but if someone has a concrete idea and can show a mockup (html or a piece of paper I don't mind) then I'd be happy to discuss it further.\n",
