We'd be required to write a more efficient cvar (like a mutex), but that should in theory be much easier. I think that it could be added in a backwards compatible way, I'm thinking that the `wait` function takes the mutex's `Guard` structure.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton  Yes, but it needs to be done carefully.\n\nAccording to http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/:\n\n\"When a thread waits on a condition variable, having specified a particular mutex to either the pthread_cond_timedwait() or the pthread_cond_wait() operation, a dynamic binding is formed between that mutex and condition variable that remains in effect as long as at least one thread is blocked on the condition variable. During this time, the effect of an attempt by any thread to wait on that condition variable using a different mutex is undefined. Once all waiting threads have been unblocked (as by the pthread_cond_broadcast() operation), the next wait operation on that condition variable shall form a new dynamic binding with the mutex specified by that wait operation. [...]\"\n\nSo unless one determines that this is not actually a problem on all implementations, then a safe interface will also need to enforce this itself.\n",
