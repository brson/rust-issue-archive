    "body": "The libs team discussed this during triage yesterday, and the conclusion was that we probably don't actually want a `Display` implementation on `Duration`. Following [the guidelines for `Display`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/8e2d3a3341da533f846f61f10335b72c9a9f4740/text/0565-show-string-guidelines.md#user-facing-fmtdisplay) an interesting point about durations is that there seems to be no \"one true way\" to display them that is both not lossy and useful. As a result, it's likely that we may want to provide adapters which themselves implement `Display` to get different methods of formatting a duration, but we probably don't want a `Display` implementation itself on the type.\n\nAs a result I'm going to close this for now, but we also decided we'd be fine with an unstable method returning a display-able adapter, so feel free to open a PR with that!\n",
