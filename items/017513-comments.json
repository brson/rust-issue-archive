    "body": "@chris-morgan, I haven't really looked at it, but that's a good idea. It seemed to work with the default errorformat so I just built it off that, but I can integrate the one from rustc.\n\nIt would make things a lot simpler if Cargo would always output absolute file names, but one thing that I like about the final result of this compiler is that the paths are relative, but correct. I personally think it's unnecessary extra noise to always prepend each file path with the absolute path of the project, so there are two possible ways to improve this:\n1. Have Cargo output absolute file names, either by default or with a switch, and use `QuickFixCmdPost` to make each path relative to the current directory.\n2. Have Cargo output file names relative to the current directory instead of to Cargo.toml, either by default or with a switch, rendering `QuickFixCmdPost` unnecessary.\n\nI like the idea of Cargo providing switches to toggle between different absolute/relative file path modes, but otherwise would be happy with a sane default.\n",

    "body": "I made some changes based on the feedback.\n\nLooking at `g:cargo_manifest_name`, it occurred to me that it won't be at all useful for values outside of `cargo.toml` unless it gets passed in as a flag to Cargo. Most of the commands support a `--manifest-path` option, but since it's not universal (`new` for example doesn't support it), there's no easy way to do it since it would need to change `makeprg` based on the command being run.\n\nI don't think this should block this PR, but it would be great if Cargo accepted `--manifest-path` as a direct flag, and simply ignored it for subcommands that don't need it. Then `g:cargo_manifest_name` could theoretically be anything and Cargo will still be able to find it, at least when it's invoked from Vim.\n",
