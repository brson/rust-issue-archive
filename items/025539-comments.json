The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pcwalton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "I'm somewhat hesitant about this as it would not necessarily enable cross-compiles easier on Windows, and would perhaps make it harder to compile Rust code in a Cygwin environment, for example. Using just \"gcc\" feels more \"standard\" in this case and moving to specifically a cross compiler sticks out as no other architecture does this.\n\nSome specific thoughts of mine:\n- The 32-bit MSYS2 shell does not have access to the 64-bit compiler mentioned here\n- A Cygwin environment may no longer be usable \"by default\"\n- Cross compilation almost always involves a toolchain with specific prefixes, so it seems somewhat odd to single out Windows\n- Both Cargo and the compiler have support for selecting a different `linker` and/or `ar` tool for managing output.\n\ncc @retep998, @vadimcn, @klutzy \n",

    "body": "Thanks for the thoughtful response.\n\nI mistakenly didn't realise you can pass arguments to rustc from cargo.  That clearly makes this less important.  And I concede I had forgotten about cygwin.\n\nOK, this can't let you compile 64-bit from 32-bit MSYS2.  On the other hand my assumption was it doesn't break anything there either.\n\nMy main argument in favour of singling out Windows is that we can (except for Cygwin).  Debian and Red Hat use different triples for Linux targets, so we can't specify the triple in the `linker` filename.  In contrast, MSYS2, Debian, Red Hat, and Arch all use the same triple in the filenames of the mingw-w64 programs.\n\nMy weaker arguments are that, perhaps, cross compilation to Windows is a more common use case than cross compilation to other targets.  Or that, sometimes, when cross compiling on Linux to Linux you don't need a different `linker`, but you will _always_ need a different linker to cross compile to Windows.\n\nI'll now defer to yours and other people's opinions.  Thanks.\n",

    "body": "Yeah I agree that it probably wouldn't break much today and that the cross-compile from Linux to Windows step would be a little easier, but I think the \"this doesn't seem standard\" as well as not being compatible with non-MinGW environments is pushing me over the edge a here.\n\nI think we may be able to explore this down the road but for now I'm going to close this. Using `-C linker` or the `target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.linker` config key in `.cargo/config` should do the trick for now. Thanks for the PR though!\n",
