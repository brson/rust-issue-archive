    "body": "Ah yeah I noticed that this syntax change happened soon after we landed the LLVM upgrade. I'm going to close this bug because we're not really guaranteeing that we work with an arbitrary LLVM commit at any point in time, but @richo is right in that the \"fix\" for this would be to upgrade LLVM.\n\n@richo I suspect that we'd just need to find where the personality function is added to a function declaration, and then we'd just modify how that's called. We only have one personality function globally anyway, so there shouldn't be too much extra logic around setting it.\n",

    "body": "Closing the issue seems entirely reasonable, but I'm going to keep dumping state here if that's ok, since it seems as reasonable place as any. I dug a fair bit further into this on that same branch (Which now has a lot of yolo printf debugging in it).\n\nI got as far as finding out that putting a personality on functions without landing pads is entirely broken, and discovering that the functions that need them are called `unwind_`, although it's unclear where they come from, since there's no obvious place they come from (no hits from git grep for `unwind_` or `\"unwind` that look coherent).\n\nUploading the IR made gist pretty angry, but here's what I get trying to build libcore with the compiler as it stands on the tip of that WIP branch: https://gist.github.com/richo/ceae595c0170f6e49d7c\n\nMy grand plan for this was to ideally get everything working and then refactor around a working case to avoid regressing, but it seems like it's kinda unavoidable to just do the refactoring now. The obvious place to start is to stop trying to lazily load the personality fn in declare_fn and eagerly do it when building a CrateContext, which ought to mean we can drop most of the really heinous hacks I introduced. I'm sort of at a loss for where these unwind_\\* fns come from, although I suspect that if I start grepping in llvm they'll stick out. The other thing I haven't yet dug into is where the heuristic for a function having a landing pad is, although increasingly it looks like the only explicitly created fns in rustc that actually need landing pads attached to them have them spelled out in rust_try.ll already.\n",
