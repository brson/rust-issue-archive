    "body": "Why do the lang items themselves need to be extern fns? Is it because the weak symbol is the same as the lang item symbol and the names must be exactly the same? Given the current system, I might prefer that the lang items are allowed to continue being normal rust functions but are inlined into a wrapper with a known symbol name, but if we convert intrinsics to lang items then there will be additional precedent for having extern lang items (I still might like the wrappers though so the lang items don't have to artifically use a specific name).\n\nFinally, if we are going to demand that certain Rust-specific symbols always exist, I would prefer they start with `__rust_` to make it absolutely clear these are implementation details.\n",
