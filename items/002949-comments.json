    "body": "This is sort of an unsolvable problem.  We don't want to say that the type of a variable is _precisely equal_ to its first assignment.  Imagine, for example, that we implement the \"case class\" proposal and therefore `some` and `none` are types.  Then a program like this:\n\n```\nlet mut x = none;\n...\nx = some(3);\n```\n\nwould be illegal.  But at the same time there are a series of conflicting constraints.  Right now we take the ML approach and print a message at the point we detect the inconsistency.  This is probably fine, but where we go wrong is that we (like every other type-inferring language I've used) choose to blame the point where we detected the inconsistency, when really the incorrect statement could be any of the statements that contribute.  So probably the best we can do is identify the contradictory constraints and the statements which led to them, and let the user decide which one is wrong.\n",
