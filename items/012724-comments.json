I think that `RefCell` is a bad-enough name and it has common-enough usage that we should use a better name for it.\n\nI'm not too worried about `Mut` vs `mut` because these two declarations are quite different:\n\n``` rust\nlet x = Mut::new(3);\nlet mut x = 3;\n```\n\nThe first has an explicit `::new` where the second one does it, and I think that all introductory examples to rust will not encourage usage of `Mut` but rather `mut`. In structs, `Mut` actually looks quite nice as well:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo {\n    field1: Mut<T>,\n    field2: U,\n}\n```\n\nIt's quite clear that in this case `field1` is a _mutable field_ which you then have to understand is dynamically checked.\n",
