  "body": "Previously, any library of the pattern `lib<name>-<hash>-<version>.so` was\n\n> considered a candidate (rightly so) for loading a crate. Sets are generated for\n> each unique `<hash>`, and then from these sets a candidate is selected. If a set\n> contained more than one element, then it immediately generated an error saying\n> that multiple copies of the same dylib were found.\n\nThis is incorrect because each candidate needs to be validated to actually\ncontain a rust library (valid metadata). This commit alters the logic to filter\neach set of candidates for a hash to only libraries which are actually rust\nlibraries. This means that if multiple false positives are found with the right\nname pattern, they're all ignored.\n\nCloses #13010\n",
