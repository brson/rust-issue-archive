    "body": "Does `rustc` support plugins at the moment? Or do you just mean a separate tool built on the rustc crate that will process the attributes? I think the idea of an `#[external]` attribute is nice, but if compiler plugins are optional, I feel this should still be part of the `rustc` frontend by default, since it's likely something people would want regularly. Alternatively there should be a way to specify 'default compiler plugins', and I would petition for it to be included and always loaded if this is the case, but that's outside the scope of this ticket.\n\nThere are other considerations now that I'm awake and more coherent:\n- Sometimes you want a little more sophisticated build system than just the crate names, anyway. This is especially important with integrating C code. Ruby's gems basically allows extensions etc to invoke semi-arbitrary build rules for say, a library (run makefiles, configure, stuff like that,) followed by the regular 'install that gem and also this .a too' or whatever.\n  \n  This sort of responsibility should certainly lie with cargo, at least in theory; Cabal for Haskell, for example, will invoke a custom `configure` script during the build preparation (if you tell it) to check for things like headers, etc (can be autoconf or hand written,) and you can even make it invoke a totally arbitrary Makefile that does whatever build you want at the build stage. rustc should not be a build system.\n- The preprocessor and related stuff in terms of options. It's the worst thing ever basically I know, but many times C files may require certain defines to be passed to the C files by the compiler. I think this can be handled with a combination of `#[cfg]` and the hypothetical `#[external]`, i.e\n\n```\n#[cfg(target_os = \"win32\")]\n#[external(cc_opts = \"-DPLATFORM_WIN32\")]\n```\n\netc. I have needed this in my LevelDB bindings - the source can be trivially compiled and thrown into just about any build system, but it does need some configuration logic depending on the platform it's compiled for.\n\nLevelDB actually uniquely defines this issue somewhat, as it touches almost all of the points I'm thinking of. I wrapped it into a Cabal build rather easily, and it is 'complete' in that the Cabal build system is on par with the included one the authors wrote(it's really simple itself.) Basically:\n- LevelDB is very portable for the most part, as the .cpp source can basically just be thrown at `g++`/`clang++` with a few preprocessor defines and you're good to go. This is nice because you can work it into almost any build system inline, as opposed to a prerequisite installation step. I just tell cabal to build all the `.cpp` files and include them inline.\n- The LevelDB source _does_ require you to pass a `#define` specifying the build platform, so you need to compile the sources with `-DPLATFORM_OSX` or `-DPLATFORM_LINUX` or `-DPLATFORM_FREEBSD`. This has to always be specified. This could be handled just by `#[cfg]` though as I said above (theoretically.)\n- LevelDB optionally has support for compression via snappy. I handle this by using an autoconf script to look for `-lsnappy` and `snappy.h` at configure time, and if it exists, I tell Cabal to pass `-DSNAPPY` into the build of the CPP code, and also tell Cabal to build all the packages that depend on _my library_ to link with `-lsnappy`, since they now need it at link time. `link_args` in the crate/module metadata already handles this, but I don't know about how to persist that info inbetween configure logic -> rustc build logic.\n\nOverall these kinds of requirements will invariably appear as people begin integrating more libraries and bindings into Rust code - I'm definitely at a dead end on binding a few libs because of it. \n\nPersonally I almost always attempt to distribute these kinds of packages as standalone as possible in this manner, by working them into the toolchain instead of external installs, providing shims/glue, because as the library author, I wish to pay this effort _up front_, as opposed to paying every time you use the library - complicated build instructions fall into this space. It makes the user experience just much, much better.\n\nI realize this is already going long beyond the initial scope of the ticket it may feel, but these are very important issues people are going to run into soon I speculate, so discussion will happen one way or another. :)\n\nOverall I think a good initial braindump on the whole scheme consists of:\n- Allow `rustc` to compile C/CPP files, either by the command line, or a separate `#[external]` attribute. I like the attribute approach since you can specify other options to the C compiler that way, too. With `#cfg` I can probably get pretty far this way, passing necessary #defines etc based on OS (which is fairly common.)\n- Allow rust users to specify native functions that point to link-time symbols, outside of shared libraries. Perhaps a `native fn` with an attribute such as `external` with something like `link_name`? Then you could say:\n  \n  ```\n  #[external(c_src = \"foo_glue.c\", link_name = \"foo_bar\")]\n  fn c_foo_bar(baz: *u8, quux: uint)\n  ```\n- Cargo should allow _some_ flexibility for a build, besides just a crate-by-crate run over the source. Invariably some builds are going to need configure time logic (like `snappy.h` detection) and trying to build all the variations of this with `#cfg` or having to write rust plugins for it (so you could further parse attributes and keep the rust compiler minimal) is going to be a hellish nightmare. It'd just be easier to tell cargo 'run this set of commands in the source dir e.g. `./configure; make` and err if they fail, then build this crate, and install the crate followed by this arbitrary libfoobar.a which we will link later.' I'm not sure of the best way to approach this.\n\nRelating to the last point I feel Cargo should just be a package manager - it installs things. It should be good at that. But it should support people to have _build systems_ that go beyond crate-level logic, because while Rust has a nice compilation model with logic for this built into the crates/sources itself, the rest of the world doesn't. Almost every package that's based on a system wide library like zmq or mongrel2 (for simple examples) can probably just get away with a `native mod`, and things will work beautifully, but glue code and more complex builds are very common as well, especially in libraries.\n\nSorry for the length, but this is a semi complicated issue with many facets. I am interested in looking into and implementing it, as it will be crucial to many packages I think, but it crosses between rustc and cargo, brings into question their responsibilities, and potentially requires lots of careful decision making, so I would appreciate what other Rust users (and developers!) think.\n",

    "body": "rustc does not support plugins yet, but many of the things it does (#fmt, config, testing) should, in my opinion, be done by plugins (in this case default plugins that are always guaranteed to be there)\n\nThere's a ticket open about creating some mechanism to set crate attributes via the build system: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/612 . There already exists a limited way to set the configuration on the command line.\n\nI believe native modules do not strictly need to refer to shared libraries. There is some way to use the `#[nolink]` attribute, then link in a static library, and have it work. It may need to be more ergonomic, but all the basic mechanisms to make it work should already exist.\n\nI like a lot of the ideas you have here, and it sounds like you have a good grasp on some of the practical problems that actual users are going to run into, so am totally supportive of any improvements you want to make in this area. Let's break these down into smaller, discreet issues that can be tackled independently.\n\nYou will also want to get feedback from @graydon because he has some opinions on these subjects.\n",
