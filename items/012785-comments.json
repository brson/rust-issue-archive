    "body": "Might not be a good idea to merge this, because it has unintuitively slow performance.\n\nSpecifically, you might expect linked_list.iter().take(K).rev() to take O(k) operations, but instead it takes O(n) where n is the size of a linked list (and in fact, the current implementation will be slow for all iterators).\n\nThose wanting to do this can use iter().rev().skip(N - K) instead, which makes the performance impact obvious.\n\nOr they can more sensibly decide to collect the first K elements in a vector, and then reverse that, which is the time-efficient way of doing it.\n",
