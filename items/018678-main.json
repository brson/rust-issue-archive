  "body": "By default, jemalloc only uses a prefix on OS X, iOS and Windows where\nattempting to replace the platform allocator is broken. The lack of a\nprefix allows jemalloc to override the weak symbols from the C standard\nlibrary to replace the system allocator.\n\nThis results in a performance improvement for memory allocation in C\nalong with reduced fragmentation. For example, the time spent on LLVM\npasses in the Rust compiler on Linux is cut by 10% and peak memory usage\nis reduced by 15%. Even on platforms like FreeBSD where jemalloc is the\nsystem allocator, this eliminates the inevitable external fragmentation\nand performance hit caused by using two general purpose allocators.\n\nCloses #18676\n",
