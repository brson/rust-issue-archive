  "body": "I was benchmarking rust-http recently, and I saw that 50% of its time was spent\ncreating buffered readers/writers. Albeit rust-http wasn't using\nstd::rt::io::buffered, but the same idea applies here. It's much cheaper to\nmalloc a large region and not initialize it than to set it all to 0. Buffered\nreaders/writers never use uninitialized data, and their internal buffers are\nencapsulated, so any usage of uninitialized slots are an implementation bug in\nthe readers/writers.\n",
