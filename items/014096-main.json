  "body": "The goal of this refactoring is to make the rustc driver code easier to understand and use. Since this is as close to an API as we have, I think it is important that it is nice. On getting stuck in, I found that there wasn't as much to change as I'd hoped to make the stage... functions easier to use by tools (which is a good thing :-) ).\n\nThis patch only moves code around - mostly just moving code to different files, but a few extracted method refactorings too. To summarise the changes: I added driver::config which handles everything about configuring the compiler. driver::session now just defines and builds session objects. I moved driver code from librustc/lib.rs to librustc/driver/mod.rs so all the code is one place. I extracted methods to make emulating the compiler without being the compiler a little easier. Within the driver directory, I moved code around to more logically fit in the modules.\n",
