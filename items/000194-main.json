  "body": "This branch adds more tests for the circular buffer runtime class, and makes it work correctly for items that do not have a power of two size. It does this by completely removing the assumption that the buffer is sized to a power of two. I can't say what affect this change has on performance but I figure that's not too important right now.\n\nSome of the intermediate commits are not correct, but they do reflect how I did the work. I can roll them up into a single commit if you want.\n",
