The follow still fails:\n\n``` rust\nmod foo {\n    use vectors = std::vec;\n    use vectors::raw;\n}\n```\n\nwith `error: unresolved import. maybe a missing `extern mod vectors`?` `error: failed to resolve import `vectors::raw``.\n\nI think the test case here works because it's importing `vectors` into the top of the crate, and use statements are always relative to there.\n",
