    "body": "The problem is that if `dir::new` were reexported at a different publicly-reachable location then the type `Filesystem` would indeed be a private API in a public signature. It's generally quite difficult to determine if something is publicly reexported somewhere else (as it could be a very long chain of reexports), so it's much easier to think about in terms of \"is it `pub` or not?\"\n\nThe workaround you have reexports `Filesystem` as a public type, so that is working as intended.\n",
