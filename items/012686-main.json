  "body": "`Share` implies that all _reachable_ content is _threadsafe_.\n\nThreadsafe is defined as \"exposing no operation that permits a data race if multiple threads have access to a &T pointer simultaneously\". (NB: the type system should guarantee that if you have access to memory via a &T pointer, the only other way to gain access to that memory is through another &T pointer)...\n\nFixes #11781\ncc #12577 \n# What this PR will do\n- [x] Add Share kind and\n- [x]  Replace usages of Freeze with Share in bounds.\n- [x] Add Unsafe<T> #12577\n- [x] Forbid taking the address of a immutable static item with `Unsafe<T>` interior\n# What's left to do in a separate PR (after the snapshot)?\n- Remove `Freeze` completely \n",
