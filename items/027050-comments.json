It seems very likely to make _compilation_ slower, and istm there's a chance this could turn into a dead end if it turns out that writing the switch IR directly produces better code more often.\n\nEDIT: I asked @sunfish about this strategy and he seemed enthusiastic. We should definitely do a bunch of measurement for regressions in both runtime and compile time before merging.\n",

    "body": "So, I have done some preliminary profiling.\n\nExecutive summary: This new `match` implementation runs faster, but regresses quality of generated code.  I don't think we can land it as is without addressing the last set of micro-benchmark results presented in the shell transcript at the bottom of this comment.\n\n---\n\nLonger story:\n\n### rustc compiling libsyntax data\n\nOn some \"normal code\" operating on a \"normal input\" (in this case, `rustc` compiling an [expanded `libsyntax.rs`](https://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/dd22960ab4acaeb10d5d)), the differences appear to be well within the noise.\n- [reference data (google sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZbuFnrb1LPFpp89WnIT-nMlTRLierrn2Ga7O35yCkKI/edit?usp=sharing), see sheet 1\n  - a caveat: this set of data was gathered with some other load (namely a web browser editing above spreadsheet) on the machine in question.  I discovered this had significant impact while working on the second data set below, and so I removed the extra load, but I have not gathered new numbers for the `libsyntax.rs` compiles yet.\n\n### rustc compiling many_small_arms data\n\nOn `rustc` operating on arguably abnormal input, namely a [test case with a 5,000 tiny `match` arms](https://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/dc22b38808c79fe0cec9), the new `match` code within trans is quite a bit faster than the old match code (within trans), perhaps a 4/3 speedup.  (Don't get excited, there's huge drawback, discussed below.)\n- Note that I'm talking about _codegen time_ here, measured by the difference between compiling to the end versus with `-Z no-trans`.\n- And this is codegen for an arguably ridiculous test case.\n- [reference data (google sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZbuFnrb1LPFpp89WnIT-nMlTRLierrn2Ga7O35yCkKI/edit?usp=sharing), see sheet 2\n- All of this data was gathered on an unloaded machine.\n\nIn both the above cases, I'm measuring codegen time, without passing `-O` to the compiler (because I was not interested in how long LLVM was taking to optimize the code it was given, though perhaps that would indeed be something of independent significance).\n\n### many_small_arms execution time data\n\nBUT, this comes at a troubling cost.\n\nI mentioned that test input with 5,000 tiny `match` arms above.  It was designed to measure how fast the new `match` code was taking within trans.\n\nBut I then realized that I probably could (and should) be measuring the quality of the code being generated by the `match` in the test.\n\nThe test case above was a little bit too trivial for something like LLVM to optimize, and it also had a println in the code I would want to be an inner loop, so I modified it slightly (essentially to take and return data, and to stop printing the match result; its probably still quite easy for LLVM to optimize as written).\n\nThe new test case is here: [5,000 arm matches called 100,000 times with varying inputs](https://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/e0fba7887d313821b5ab).\n\nAfter doing this, I discovered an unfortunate drawback to the new code in this PR.  Compiling with `-O` has almost no impact on the execution time, but if you leave off `-O` (as many people do during development), the runtime for this test case goes from 0.27 seconds to 9.32 seconds, a more than 30x slowdown.\n\n```\n% cd ../../rust-baseline/objdir-opt/\n% git log -1 --oneline\n6800538 Auto merge of #26984 - nham:errorck-ignore-long-diag, r=brson\n% ./x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc --version\nrustc 1.3.0-dev (680053848 2015-07-13)\n% time ./x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc /tmp/driver_run.rs -o driver_run \n\nreal    0m14.264s\nuser    0m14.073s\nsys 0m0.187s\n% time ./driver_run \n\nreal    0m0.279s\nuser    0m0.262s\nsys 0m0.003s\n% cd ../../rust-rw-match/objdir-opt/\n% git log -1 --oneline\n54b4a0f Fix lint.\n% ./x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc --version\nrustc 1.3.0-dev (54b4a0f5b 2015-07-16)\n% time ./x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc /tmp/driver_run.rs -o driver_run \n\nreal    0m13.745s\nuser    0m13.523s\nsys 0m0.219s\n% time ./driver_run \n\nreal    0m9.235s\nuser    0m9.219s\nsys 0m0.006s\n% \n```\n\n(Above shell transcript was gathered on an unloaded machine.)\n\nNow, I know this is a totally artificial micro-benchmark, but\n1. I think the benchmark remains somewhat demonstrative of real-world dispatch code, and\n2. this is one of those cases that motivates using a micro-benchmark -- to try to tease out performance cliffs like the one shown here.\n",

    "body": "Hmm... addressing that particular micro-benchmark requires generating a binary search tree or jump table (probably using an LLVM switch instruction).  Conceptually, it's pretty simple: basically, it's just a matter of splitting the match statement based on integer fields.  In practice, there are a lot of details... especially if we want a decent heuristic to decide which field to split on first.  Not sure it's worthwhile, given that this code is going to get killed by MIR.\n",
