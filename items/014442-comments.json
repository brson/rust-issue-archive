If the compiler invoked the intrinsics with `&str`, none of the assertion code would be necessary.\n",

    "body": "Removing the conversion of c-string to Rust strings saved some of the size. There is 1.3kB remaining in assertion messages and file names. And 3.7kB in string formatting from `secret_show` inclusions from `format_args!`. I managed to track down where the `secret_show` functions were being included from the asm, a pointer to the function is included in the `Arguments<>` passed to the `begin_unwind`. (It didn't come up as a function call because there is no branch instruction)\n\n@alexcrichton Thanks for your help - is there anything more that can be done? Or is this a will-not-fix thing? For my use I may end up patching failure.rs to pass a blank Arguments and a zero length file name just to cut the size down. Zinc isn't anything more than an experiment at this point, so I'm very grateful for your assistance so far shaving a few kB off.\n",

    "body": "I'm all for shaving off what we can, and in general reducing code size. It sounds like the remaining code size is just code in general, so there may not any more low-hanging fruit in terms of code-size. If https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/93 is accepted then the footprint of `secret_show` will likely be reduced to smaller than it is today.\n\nI wouldn't consider this a will-not-fix thing, but we also don't want to compromise too much on the current functionality of libcore. If you find any size-related issues, please definitely feel free to open an issue, I'd love to trim it down to as small as can be!\n",
