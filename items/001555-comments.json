    "body": "I'd be interested in working on this. I like the idea of rustdoc being distributed and updated by cargo. However, I have some other concerns that should probably be split off in another ticket (maybe one already exists?) I think it will be important as people begin writing more bindings for Rust.\n\nThe thing is, that it would be nice if rustdoc could just distribute the C files as part of the build, to minimize the need to build and install a dynamic library. However, I see no way of having Cargo handle this at the moment as it only builds crates - for comparison, GHC accomplishes this by just accepting C files on the command line and giving them to gcc appropriately as part of the build/link. So that's one thing (just give any c/cpp files to rustc as part of the build) I think has a pretty good power-weight ratio.\n\nIn general I tend to use this kind of feature a lot to bind libraries in a 'standalone' manner - many small libraries such as sundown, leveldb, etc. can be included in the source without much hassle and the need for external installation (and in the case of both sundown and leveldb, there is no `install` target in their build system anyway.) This makes the package easier to install from a users point of view and requires one less global library (and headaches installing it.)\n\nFurthermore, this kind of support in the frontend/cargo makes it much easier to write rust libraries that have C wrappers for libraries that _do_ exist on the system. If you have a C++ library like `re2`, which is installed in `/usr/local` or whatever, it's easy to just wrap up the basic functionality in a C shim expose it from rust. Then you can just give the shim to the compiler with your crate, and it'll build it and link it as part of the result. Alternatively, Cargo can handle this.\n\nFinally, one point worth considering too is that, in GHC for example, C files you give it can include FFI headers and all sorts of stuff from the runtime system because it sets `-I` paths for gcc appropriately; arguably, you may not want the user to fumble around with finding header file installation paths if they do want to interface with `rt`, since the compiler being invoked will have direct knowledge of the correct path anyway.\n\nIn general I don't know what this means for native functions, since native modules depend on the name of the module/`link_name` to determine what shared library to use. The FFI in GHC merely lets you point a function to some arbitrary symbol name.\n\nThis problem can be attacked multiple ways. They all involve Cargo, really. It can handle all this logic of passing C shims to `gcc` directly, or rustc can handle it, and cargo just appropriately passes the `.c` files to rustc, etc. There are plenty of good reasons why putting this functionality in Cargo might be better, but I think just having `rustc` able to handle .c and .cpp files appropriately is a good push in the right direction and nails lots of easy cases like this without too much complexity gain. Support for this would make this ticket very easy, ultimately allow rustdoc to be handled by cargo (with an installation that can happen right after you install just rustc and cargo, since there aren't other external dependencies,) and it would buy a lot when people want to Cargo to build other kinds of bindings (that are standalone, need wrappers or interface with `rt`, etc.)\n\nSorry for this being long, it perhaps should be split up into multiple tickets. So please let me know if this is way off base, or sounds crazy, etc. Maybe nobody even wants to be able to do this, maybe it's already done and this ticket is easy? I find myself running into this case a lot, personally. If this seems like a good idea though, I'd be more the happy to make a ticket and begin hammering away.\n",
