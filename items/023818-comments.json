    "body": "Could there be new macros for this use case? I'd hate for Rust I/O to be harder to use correctly than C++'s especially in a common learning case. For example, since C++ does flush `cout` when `cin` is read, the following works fine there but the equivalent doesn't for Rust:\n\n``` cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout << \"Type something: \";\n\n    std::string input;\n    std::cin >> input;\n\n    std::cout << input << std::endl;\n} \n```\n\nAlso according to the C standard:\n\n```\n At program startup, three text streams are predefined and need not be opened explicitly\n\u2014 standard input (for reading conventional input), standard output (for writing\nconventional output), and standard error (for writing diagnostic output). As initially\nopened, the standard error stream is not fully buffered; the standard input and standard\noutput streams are fully buffered if and only if the stream can be determined not to refer\nto an interactive device.\n```\n",

    "body": "> I think Rust is losing ease of use by making auto-flushing more difficult than need be.\n\nThe design here is generally mostly about trade-offs. On one hand you have \"ease of use\" where you don't have to worry about calling `flush()`, but on the other hand you have worries about deadlocking, and/or surprising behavior happening behind the scenes. On the other hand you have to write a few more `flush` calls, but you know precisely what is happening and can avoid situations like deadlocking fairly easily.\n\nFor example, what should this code do?\n\n``` rust\nlet input = io::stdin();\nlet mut locked = input.lock();\n\nprint!(\"enter input: \");\nlet mut input = String::new();\ntry!(locked.read_line(&mut input));\n\nprintln!(\"you entered: {}\", input);\n```\n\nIf `print!` were to auto-flush, then it would deadlock the current process because the stdin handle was already locked. The alternative here is adding one call to `try!(locked.flush())` right above the call to `read_line`.\n",

Python has `print(\"foo\", end='')`. Ruby as `print` and easy auto-flushing.\n\nAlso, given the similar naming, I think `print!` and `println!` should have the same behavior with the exception of printing a newline.\n\nIf you're building up output incrementally and you're fine with buffering, then why not append to a `String` and then just print that or use `.write`?\n",

    "body": "AFAICT currently the behaviour of C, i.e. the default buffering policy (as per the setoff documentation) is respected. At least on Unix-like systems this means that printing a newline flushes when writing to a terminal. @tanadeau is this what you were looking for?\n\nIn general, this looks like a reasonable compromise to me, as non-interactive input gets good performance thanks to buffering, while interactive programs show each line as soon as it is complete.\nI believe that the only issue with this might be with in-line prompts.\n\nAn even better approach could be to make `flush` more permissive. Multiple threads writing to `stdout` can lead to interleaved meaningless output if care is not taken (basically by ensuring sequentiality of the writes), such problem does not affect flushing. I think that the old approach of flushing `stdout` upon a `stdin` read would ensure the most obvious behaviour for interactive programs and preserve performance for non-interactive programs.\nIf this (flushing without locking) looks like an acceptable approach, I would be willing to implement it.\n",

I was using println! until now and now I tried to write a line and then wait in the same line for input, to solve this I had to read this issue(and then of course I've read the entire conversation)...\nIt was strange to me that nothing was appearing although I said `print!`.\n\nI think of `println!` and `print!` as helpers. If I want control/performance I will use Stdout and Stdin manually. `print!` is over-complicated and I don't think that it optimizes for the cases it will actually be used.\nAt the same time, it's good that I found more info on how to optimize stdout(not to flush to often when you don't need it), but I don't see many users appreciating this because they don't need this. They just wanted to print.\n\nOf course I don't agree with flushing `stdout` before `stdin`. May be I get a lot of input(it could be another application) and I am not interested to flush every time the stdout. I might write more into the buffer based on what I get on stdin and at the end make 1 single flush.\n",

    "body": "I'm in favor of **_not flushing `print!()`_** as part of the macro.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong!  **I totally understand where the for-flush guys are coming from!** I felt the same way about flushing in the first languages I learned.  So, I don't have any animosity or anything.\r\n\r\nLet me try to convince you that you *don't actually want `print!` to flush!*  The current behavior is elegant, loosely coupled, and well-designed.  Also, I have some suggestions!  They are after the argument.\r\n\r\nCase Against Flushing in `print!`\r\n----\r\n\r\n- **Flushing violates expectations.**\u2020  `stdout` is line-buffered. It would be **unexpected** for a macro that \"_uses the `format!` syntax to write data to the standard output._\"\u2021 to also change the behavior of `stdout`.  Being line-buffered means that data is buffered until either a newline has been seen or a large-enough amount of data has been buffered, either of which causes the data to be flushed.\r\n  _\u2020The expectations of those who understand `stdout`._\r\n  _\u2021Quote [from the docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html)_\r\n\r\n- **`println!` also does not flush.**  Wait, what!?  Don't believe me?  [Check for yourself](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/macros.rs.html#121-125)!  Once again, `stdout` is controlling the behavior.  `stdout` sees a newline _and decides to flush_, but `println!` just \"_uses the `format!` syntax to write data to the standard output._\"\r\n\r\n- **Loose coupling has benefits.**  `print!` and `println!` are [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) to `stdout`, which is part of my claim that the design is elegant.\r\n\r\n- **Knowing that stdout is line-buffered is valuable.**   By extension, anything that gently leads you to that knowledge is also valuable.\r\n\r\n- **Current behavior mirrors other languages.** I will concede that \"doing it the way everyone else does\" is often a lousy reason *by itself*, but it can be a great addition to a list of other reasons! \ud83d\ude09 Several of the languages I have used do exactly the same thing...make their `stdout` line-buffered, and then have a way to print _with_ a newline that ends up getting flushed, and a way to print _without_ a newline that ends up not getting flushed.  For me, I absolutely expected the output of`print!` **not** to be flushed when I learned it did not add a newline to the message.\r\n\r\n- **Already mentioned stuff.**  Other stuff mentioned above by others already in this thread.\r\n\r\nBut the PAIN is REAL! (aka Suggestions)\r\n----\r\nYes, it is!  I know the pain is real!  I know exactly what it feels like to look at your program and wonder \"where the heck is my output?\"  I probably did it three dozen times before I **finally** caught on to How Things Really Worked(tm).  It's a real thing that most real programmers that I know go through (except those super-brilliant guys who \"just get it\" the first time they read something, but lets ignore them, because sometimes they need to be ignored for the rest of us to stay sane. \ud83d\ude1c )\r\n\r\nHere are some things that could be done *in the language implementation/docs*:\r\n\r\n- **Explain it in the macro docs.**  The docs for `print!` and `println!` could mention in a relevant way that actual flushing is done by `stdout`, which is line-buffered, and then **link to the page for `stdout`** right there.  Wait!  Wait!  I'll actually give some suggested text:\r\n\r\n> Due to the default line-buffered nature of [std::io::Stdout](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdout.html), each call to `println!` will normally end up being flushed immediately.\r\n\r\n> Due to the default line-buffered nature of [std::io::Stdout](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdout.html), calls to `print!` will not normally be flushed immediately.\r\n\r\n- **Add line-buffering behavior language to the docs for [std::io::Stdout](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdout.html)**  This behavior isn't mentioned in the docs.  It should be!\r\n\r\n- **Make a more flexible macro/function/object.**  Or in other words, \"Go back to the drawing board.\"  As a concrete example, in the Python community for years I observed this same pain-point with their `print` *statement* implementation.  By default, Python's `print` *statement* includes a newline (so the output gets flushed) unless you end the statement with a comma, which causes the newline to be omitted (which meant the output suddenly stopped flushing, unless you included your own newline).  First they addressed this through documentation of behavior (which helped a lot), but there was no decent way to actually add an optional way to override behavior.  BUT, when the time came around that they decided to add a fancier `print` *function* to version 2.7/3.x, they addressed this pain point by giving the function an optional argument that would also explicitly flush.  The combination of documentation plus an easy-to-remember, convenient way to force flushing seems to have done a good job at addressing that pain point.  I don't know if an analogous behavior could be implemented in Rust macros.  I know functions don't support optional arguments (will they ever?).  But if it could be done somehow...fantastic!  Maybe it means taking an entirely different approach to the idiomatic way to print to stdout.  I dunno.\r\n\r\n- **Make an additional macro.  Maybe `print_and_flush!`** Sorta clunky, but at least intent would be very clear.\r\n\r\n- **Make a `flush!` macro.**  Enough said.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nHere are some things you could do *in your own code*:\r\n\r\n- **Write your own macro.**\r\n```rust\r\n// placeholder for a nice macro you can copy-and-paste - help me out here, someone\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Make a helper function.** If you happen to be dealing with all string literals, or really similar formatting, it might be just as convenient to just write your own helper function that also flushes.  Here is a pretty nice starting point you can copy-and-paste:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn printflush<S>(msg: S) where S: Into<String> {\r\n    print!(\"{}\", msg.into());\r\n    std::io::stdout().flush().unwrap();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Bite the bullet.** Add this line wherever you want to flush.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstd::io::stdout().flush().unwrap();\r\n```",

    "body": "I feel that some of the confusion comes from the fact that `stdout` is line buffered. Flushing is entirely up to the buffer and depends on the value of its content at runtime. It is implicit and left out of not only `print!` and `println!`'s semantics but also `write!` and `writeln!`'s. This, I find, is contrary to Rust's culture of explicitness and orthogonality.\r\n\r\nA solution would be to make `stdout` a normal buffer:\r\n* `print!` and `println!` explicitly call flush and do what you expect: paint on screen. Behavior is mostly the same as today, minus the sometimes missing text with `print!` that surprises newcomers.\r\n* `write!` and `writeln!` can be used to build output. Flush must be called manually and we could now buffer multiple lines of text without triggering a flush, which we can't do today without allocating another buffer/string. (We may or may not want to create `write_out!` and `writeln_out!` macros that do not bypass `LOCAL_STDOUT` the way `write!` and `writeln!` do.)\r\n\r\nLine buffering has its uses, but I feel like it's trying to be smart but it's really just making things more complicated.",

(C)\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I'm fully aware the #23823 #25555 are closed, but I have a question on the same thing: How can I write simple and consistent code like C's\r\n```C\r\n  char str_in[1024];\r\n  printf(\"enter some text: \");\r\n  gets(str_in);\r\n  printf(\"your input is \\\"%s\\\"\", str_in);\r\n```\r\nin Rust? Which would let me input some text on the same line with the prompt for it, without using `std::io::prelude::*`, calling `io::stdout().flush()` and doing alike fancy things...\r\n\r\nI try to call `print!(\"enter some text: \")` and then `read_line(&mut str_in)` (rustc 1.21.0 in Windows 8.1) and I get `read_line()` call __before__ printing the prompt.\r\n\r\nWhich seems very strange for an outsider to Rust.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\np.s. Flushing the console buffer just before reading it (at any form) seemed a good idea, but it was rejected. I failed to understand why.",

    "body": "The problem here is that a bunch of new Rust users are going to be confused by behavior that isn't well-documented and in my opinion a bit surprising, without being given any warning in any official documentation, and without being given any obvious path to do what is a very common operation: printing a prompt and getting a response.\r\n\r\nPython's solution is to have the `input()` function take an optional prompt argument. C's solution is to have reading from `stdin` flush `stdout`. Rust's solution is apparently to have the user instantiate `stdout()` and invoke `flush()` on it after `print!()`. Make sure the `Write` trait is in scope. As far as I can tell this example, adapted from the \"Guessing Game\" tutorial in the documentation, is about as simple as it gets.\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nuse std::io::{stdin, stdout, Write};\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    print!(\"prompt: \");\r\n    stdout().flush().unwrap();\r\n    let mut guess = String::new();\r\n    stdin().read_line(&mut guess).unwrap();\r\n    println!(\"got {}\", guess);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(You could just `use std::io::*;` but that doesn't seem to be the favored style in Rust code, and I think it only works because the `Write` trait happens to be in the same module as `stdout`.)\r\n\r\nI see this level of fiddly complexity for a common operation routinely performed by beginning programmers as a real issue that needs to be addressed directly. Documenting the above example and giving it the page of explanation that it deserves just doesn't seem like enough to me. The fact that the last `println!()` can be replaced by a `print!()` that will then implicitly flush (because of the ending newline and default line buffering) doesn't make the explanation easier.\r\n\r\nI don't care too much about how this is addressed, but it should be somehow. Regardless of whether consensus can be reached, by all means at least hack up \"Guessing Game\" to do this so there's a standard example. But I'd strongly prefer a solution that makes \"Guessing Game\" prettier.",

    "body": "> These kinds of questions are better served by https://users.rust-lang.org/ than the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nSorry. But my *How can I* question arouses out from the decision not to flush `stdout` neither after `print!()` nor before `read_line()` calls discussed here. And I utterly comprehend the former (locking console for flushing any unfinished line would slow down performance without real need), but am still very disappointed with the latter.\r\n\r\nConstructing complex output by multiple sequential `print!()` calls is a common task for text-based programs. Flushing every output is not necessary in this case, it should be done only at the end of such a sequence. No confusion can emerge.\r\n\r\nAnother common task is interacting with the user, and the Guessing Game is a good example (a less naughty example is Rust's installer for Windows). Such a task can duly interleave the program's output with the user's input and it seems a good practice to grant the programmer a proper tool for it. Using something like print() and read() functions seems to be the solution, but with Rust it is an illusion: the programmer is obliged to bother with flushing unfinished lines of `stdout` before every read.\r\n\r\nSo why this flushing should not be seamlessly placed before every read inside Rust library? It seems obvious that before reading the user's input all the program's output ought to be flushed: the user has to see what [s]he asked for. Apropos, if the library flushes `stdout` at every new line, why it does not before every read?\r\n\r\nOr, if there is other proper practice of interacting with the user - which is it? Using strict `println!()` vividly resembles me old good BASIC times.\r\n\r\nWhence my \"How can I...?\".\r\n\r\nI fully agree with @BartMassey's conclusion above except that I emphasize the only place for flush is not after writing but before reading user's input, which is very slow by nature, where there is plenty of time to do anything useful.\r\n\r\n@BartMassey, thank you for example and explanations! I feel the issue is still not settled.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We discussed this with the libs team and our feeling was that none of the suggestions that involve an implicit flush really address the knowledge gap of people having an incorrect (or no) mental model of how buffered i/o and flushing works. These changes would just move the stumbling block to some later point when buffered i/o and flushing inevitably bites them anyway. People writing interactive command-line apps *need* to understand what flushing means and inserting implicit flushes would not be doing them any favors.\r\n\r\nWe would welcome documentation improvements that do a better job of teaching the behavior of std::io with respect to flushing.\r\n\r\nAlso we would love to consider an [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/libs_changes.md) for improving the ergonomics of explicit flushing in conjunction with `print!` or other uses of std::io. In particular, we agree that the current approach of `use std::io::{self, Write}; io::stdout().flush().expect(\"Could not flush stdout\")` is not the best -- but just condensing it into something like `flush!()` isn't obviously better either.

On the other hand, in my experiments across various languages, I've generally reserved `print!` and its relatives in other languages for times where I need to assemble a single line to print, but don't necessarily need to have it flush at separate times, in which case yes, not having a flush is largely irrelevant. And if someone is familiarizing themselves with how output streams work, and they run into unexpected behavior, they'll search, look up documentation, find threads like this, and largely come out of it with a better understanding of the situation (which I did).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I think it *would* be beneficial to have a *separate* print macro which flushes - `print_flush!` seems like the obvious name - and I'm not sure if I see the shortcoming in having a `flush!` macro as @dtolnay suggested, but at the same time I'm sure I don't know the details well enough to insist on it.",

I would recommend changing the chapter two exercise code to use `print` and  `io::stdout().flush().unwrap()` for the guess prompt. This way newbies (like myself) will just grok the rustafarian way to handle line buffered stdin. I'll try to put forth a pull request on the docs if someone has not already tried it. \r\n\r\nIf I were to make a suggestion for a more elegant solution I would go back to @CleanCut's suggestion to add a new macro. However, I would look for something a bit terser. Maybe `fl_print!` or `flprint!`? @BartMassey's suggestion of `prompt!` is a good alternative, but there may be other use cases for \"print & flush\" other than prompting for user input and 'prompt' can certainly have other connotations.",

    "body": "+1 for a python-style input! macro, which takes care of the typical write-then-read case.\r\n\r\n> Sounds good! Should we remove the implicit flushing in `println!()` as well?\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that technically `println!` doesn't flush. You can see in the [source code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/macros.rs.html#153-157) that it simply calls `print!` with an appended newline. Rather, it's the [current implementation of stdout](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/io/stdio.rs.html#341-346) which unconditionally line buffers, regardless of whether stdout is a tty or not. In fact, it's called about explicitly as a `#FIXME` in that code that the buffering behavior should be smarter; that change would implicitly change the flush behavior of all the macros that use it (print, println, and anything built on them).",

People writing interactive command-line apps need to understand what flushing means and inserting implicit flushes would not be doing them any favors.\r\n\r\nI only have a shallow understanding of how flushing works, so please forgive the question. How will people be bitten? My guess:\r\n - The application will be slower.\r\n - If a message is split between multiple print!() statements, a partial message will appear on screen, quickly followed by the message tail.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else? These issues seem trivial when I weigh them against the panic and frustration of \"I'm printing stuff but it doesn't appear on-screen.\" The people writing performance-intensive command-line apps can use non-flushing `io::stdout().write_fmt(format_args!(...))`.

    "body": "> My guess is that a large percentage of folks will (or should) read the second edition book to get started. I would recommend changing the chapter two exercise code to use `print` and `io::stdout().flush().unwrap()` for the guess prompt. This way newbies (like myself) will just grok the rustafarian way to handle line buffered stdin. I'll try to put forth a pull request on the docs if someone has not already tried it.\r\n\r\n**THIS.** I am re-reading the book trying to get into Rust again and right at the beginning of the Guessing Game chapter I recalled running into issues with flushing the first time I read the book and used `print!` instead of `println!` (so the guess would be on the same line, after a colon). Curiosity lead me here.\r\n\r\nIf no changes are going to be made for `print!`, the book should definitely use it and mention the flushing semantics.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I personally think `println!` and `print!` are used for simple logging or when getting input from the user 90% of the time. Someone also mentioned that the line-flushing is implemented at the writer level and could change under people's feet who expected `println!` to always flush (like me). Why not cater to the 90% use case and make these both more user-friendly with guaranteed flushing? For the 10% writing performance-sensitive formatting code, explicitness, and usage of low-level APIs is probably already mandatory.",

    "body": "@dtolnay \r\n> People writing interactive command-line apps _need_ to understand what flushing means\r\n\r\nIn no other programming language that I worked with is that a **need**. It is merely an \"oh, that's cool\".\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Rust breaks an expectation that is fulfilled by other languages: input given without the full output shown is garbage, unwanted input.\r\n\r\nHere are two examples:\r\n\r\n- it doesn't make sense that a line read contains the name if the \"Name: \" prompt wasn't flushed and therefore displayed beforehand\r\n- when communicating with a server, assuming the output to the server is buffered, if you make a request but then don't flush the request and then you block waiting the answer, it is safe to assume that the server never received the full request and therefore an answer will never be sent, the block on read being therefore infinite\r\n\r\nAnother question would be why `print!` and `println!` exist in the first place while a `read!` or `readline!` macro don't. Furthermore, why is there a need for `print!` when `write!` can be used? If their purpose is to make things easier, then why not go the extra step and fulfil the expectation that, when data is read from the standard input, all the data must be flushed to standard output?",

    "body": "> As a quick survey, standard output is line buffered in C, C++, Python, and Ruby. Go's `Printf` buffers output and writes it to an unbuffered stdout. Java doesn't document what it does, but `System.out` appears to autoflush.\n\nNote that the C and python behaviour (at least on Linux) is a bit more nuanced: It is line buffered when stdout is a terminal, and 1kB block buffered otherwise.\n\nFor processing large text files (either in a pipeline or writing to a file), the \"unbuffered when not a tty\" can make a huge performance difference (e.g., two orders of magnitude).",
