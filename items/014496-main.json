  "body": "### Breaking changes:\n- Rename `to_byte` to `as_byte`\n- Rename `to_char` to `as_char`\n- Deprecated `eq_ignore_case` (I don't think we want to have a special function for this when it is so easy to write `a.to_lowercase() == b.to_lowercase()`).\n### Other changes (functions copied from char):\n- Added `to_digit` function\n- Added `is_digit_radix` function\n- Added tests for these functions\n### Questions (I didn't know where to ask, so I write them here)\n- Should we derive `Copy` for `Ascii`? It sounds reasonable since it is just a `u8`.\n- Should we remove `to_ascii` (which fails if the character is not ascii) and replace it by `to_ascii_opt`?\n- Many of the functions available for `Ascii` are also available for `char`. Maybe we should unify them in a trait. At this moment we have the `Char` trait, but it has some functions specially meant for UTF8 like `is_XID_start` and `is_XID_continue`. Maybe we should split this trait in two: `Char` and `Utf8Char`.\n- I think there is some sort of chaos regarding strings of Ascii characters (you have some traits for slices of `&[Ascii]` and `Vec<Ascii>` which offer conversion to normal strings or bytes). I would like to implement an `AsciiString` to bring order to this. Should I just do it and open a PR?\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
