  "body": "The user-facing API-level change of this commit is that `SharedChan` is gone and `Chan` now has `clone`. The major parts of this patch are the internals which have changed.\n\nChannels are now internally upgraded from oneshots to streams to shared channels depending on the use case. I've noticed a 3x improvement in the oneshot case and very little slowdown (if any) in the stream/shared case.\n\nThis patch is mostly a reorganization of the `std::comm` module, and the large increase in code is from either dispatching to one of 3 impls or the duplication between the stream/shared impl (because they're not entirely separate).\n\nThe `comm` module is now divided into `oneshot`, `stream`, `shared`, and `select` modules. Each module contains the implementation for that flavor of channel (or the select implementation for select).\n\nSome notable parts of this patch\n- Upgrades are done through a semi-ad-hoc scheme for oneshots and messages for streams\n- Upgrades are processed ASAP and have some interesting interactions with select\n- send_deferred is gone because I expect the mutex to land before this\n- Some of stream/shared is straight-up duplicated, but I like having the distinction between the two modules\n- Select got a little worse, but it's still \"basically limping along\"\n- This lumps in the patch of deallocating the queue backlog on packet drop\n- I'll rebase this on top of the \"more errors from try_recv\" patch once it lands (all the infrastructure is here already)\n\nAll in all, this shouldn't be merged until the new mutexes are merged (because send_deferred wasn't implemented).\n\nCloses #11351\n",
