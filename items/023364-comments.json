I feel that `Deref` here is a bit too heavy-handed for this purpose. To me the `Deref` trait should be used primarily for `.` syntax and not necessarily for generic programming, but I know that others may differ in opinions about this :)\n\nA concrete backwards-compatibility risk is that this would enable something like `Cursor<MutexGuard<[u8]>>` where if we had a \"more proper\" trait later the `MutexGuard` type would probably not implement the trait.\n\ncc @aturon \n",

For example instead of `Cursor::new(mutex_guard)` you would instead write `Cursor::new(&*mutex_guard)` which is to say that if you can `Deref` to `[u8]` then you can already get the slice out _somehow_ for reading/writing.\n",

On the other hand, it would be quite logical to implement `Borrow<[T]>` for `[T; N]` (it is strange that it is not implemented yet) and use `Borrow<[T]>` as a conventional bound for \"slice-like things\". Another even more general variant is to use generic conversion traits from @aturon 's [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/529) (something like `As<&[T]>`) for this purpose.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton \n\nI tend to agree that we may want to take things a bit slow here. Note, however, that it's not exactly back-compat to add such an impl later, since it could introduce coherence conflicts with downstream crates. (It might be possible to do if we introduced a new trait at the same time.)\n\nMore broadly, we've had proposals like this come up for using `Deref` or conversion traits to make an impl more flexible/general/ergonomic. Maybe it would be a good idea to establish an explicit convention around this?\n",

I don't think that the use case for this generalization is super compelling today, but it doesn't mean it won't be one day! I believe the modifications here should be fine backwards-compatible additions, so the door is still open for this.\n",

    "body": "I updated my implementation. Github does not seem to recognize it if that (maybe that happens if the PR gets reopened). It now uses `AsRef` which means that fixed-sized array can now be used with `Cursor`. Besides that, the generic implementation simplifies the code as the macro can be avoided.\n\nThe only drawback is, that specialized implementation for fixed-sized arrays are now ruled out as long as [RFC#1210](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210) it not accepted & implemented.\n\n`Box<[u8]>` cannot be used yet, but that should be mitigated by [implementing `AsRef` for `Box` and friends](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/forward-implement-traits-on-smart-pointers-make-smart-pointers-more-transparent/2380/3). I would like to submit a separate PR for at some point (RFC should not be needed as it is a minor change according to RFC #1105). That is a separate issue though.\n",
