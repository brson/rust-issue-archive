This used to be about 'unsafe', but now it's 'advanced' - what is the scope here, and can the name be less ambiguous?\n\nThis is following a discussion with Dave in #research --  the title \"The unsafe Rust PL\" has the undertone that \"Rust is an unsafe language\". The updated version of the book also contains more than just unsafe rust.\n\nBut yeah, a more distinguishable title would be nice.\n",

    "body": "> Could this reasonably be merged into the existing book?\n\nSo, I used to be of this opinion, but given that it's something that only matters to a small section of Rust's audience, and it's _also_ a huuuuuuuge topic, I like the idea of it being twins, rather than together. I'm not totally opposed to putting them together, I just think I lean towards them as compliments at the moment.\n\nWith 'advanced' rather than 'unsafe', this justification is much, much weaker.\n",

    "body": "@Gankro \n\nI just re-read the ownership section. Comments below. We should also discuss in person -- I have a few thoughts about the overall structure, and some improvements to the key early sections.\n\nGeneral style point: the book is somewhat inconsistent in when it uses code formatting outside of snippets \u2014 e.g. Box is plain text but `*mut T` is quoted.\n\n# 4.1 References\n\n## References\n\nSecond set of bullets \u2014 formatting messed up\n\n## Paths\n\n\u201cIf all Rust had were values\u201d \u2014 add \u201c(no pointers)\u201d\n\nMight make more sense to say that you have a \u201cforrest\u201d of ownership, with each stack slot being the root of one tree. That\u2019s closer to how I think of things personally. (That also lets you say that globals and thread-locals are just additional roots.)\n\nSome concrete examples early on would be helpful in bringing these ideas across clearly.\n\n\u201cReferences to a value can subsequently be interpreted as a path in this tree.\u201d -> I think it\u2019s ultimately worth spelling this out in more detail \u2014 maybe we can discuss a bit in person exactly what you mean by this.\n\n\u201cestablishing a unique path\u201d \u2014 perhaps \u201ca unique _live_ path\u201d?\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether the initial distinction between stack and heap is actually worthwhile. For a long time people thought of `T` and `Box<T>` as radically different things, but for most purposes in Rust they are identical \u2014 a \u201cmere\u201d representation choice. Maybe a simpler framing would be to introduce the idea of trees and paths, and that things are simple as long as paths are unique \u2014 then show that they are unique for stack data, globals, and uniquely owned heap data. Again, slightly more detailed/concrete examples would be helpful here.\n\n\u201cShared ownership means there is no unique path\u201d -> \u201cShared ownership of a value means that there is no unique path to it\u201d.\n\n\u201cA value with no unique path limits what we can do with it\u201d -> helpful to tie this back to earlier examples of e.g. mutating a shared value causing trouble.\n\n\u201cThe most common way to establish such a path is through interior mutability\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s not quite right, or at least, it\u2019s not as clear as it could be. But I think it\u2019s easiest to talk about that one in person, to figure out a more precise framing.\n\n## Liveness\n\nHere you switch to talking about references, but I think it\u2019s actually clearer if you continue to talk about _paths_. For example, paths going through stack ownership (with no references involved) still undergo freezing, meaning that the following doesn\u2019t compile:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut p = Point { x: 1, y: 3 };\n    let borrowed = &mut p;\n    println!(\"{}\", p.x);\n}\n```\n\nSo I think liveness/frozenness should be a property of paths in general, with references \n\nOn that note, it\u2019s worth pinging @nikomatsakis about the use of \u201creborrowing\u201d here, versus \u201cfreezing\u201d. That is, the existing terminology focused on \u201cremoving\u201d liveness of existing paths by freezing them.\n\n\u201cTo simplify things, we can model variables as a fake type of reference\u201d - I think that if you reformulate this story as being about paths rather than references, this paragraph won\u2019t be needed. Let\u2019s discuss.\n\n# 4.2 Lifetimes\n\n\u201cOur examples made use of aggressive sugar\u201d - maybe add \u201cOriginally, our examples . . .\u201d\n\n## Example: references the outlive referents\n\nShould say \u201cExample 1\u201d to match later section.\n\n\u201cthe scope the scope\u201d\n\n# 4.5 Unbounded lifetimes\n\n\u201che most common source of this is derefencing a raw pointer, which produces a reference with an unbounded lifetime.\u201d - would be helpful to actually show the impl for Deref here.\n\nAlso helpful to say that \u201cunbounded\u201d means that there are no constraints on how big/small the lifetime must be. Point is that when these arise in practice, there _are_ actual constraints, but you need to tell Rust what they are.\n\nThis section still feels underdeveloped to me. I think it\u2019s a lot more useful to explain this material in the context of an example of unsafe code.\n\n# 4.6 HRTBs\n\n\u201cbasically produces an inifinite list of trait bounds that F must satisfy\u201d - worth saying that the only way to satisfy such a bound is through a blanket impl. \n\n# 4.7 Subtyping and variance\n\n\u201cThis is the general theme of variance vs invariance: if variance would allow you to store a short-lived value over a longer-lived slot, then you must be invariant.\u201d \n\n# 4.10 Splitting lifetimes\n\n\u201cso that it can be treated as disjoint from the other until we unify them when we return.\u201d - this was a little terse. Helpful to break this out into some more explicit steps (making more clear how lifetime elision is playing out here, and how the lifetime ultimately is bounded)\n\n\u201cHowever it actually does work, exactly because iterators are one-shot objects.\u201d - that, and because the iterator is tied to a mutable borrow of the original object that lives as long as the iterator (and the references it produces) does.\n\nNot sure that DoubleEndedIterator is worth showing.\n\nAlso, the fact that the slice case works out is due to already \u201cteaching\u201d Rust about splitting mutable slices through `split_at_mut`.\n",

Also, I would love to kill the use of \"RAII\" in our docs in favor of OBRM or OORM or something along those lines.\n- Intro is good.\n- Constructors section is good.\n- Destructors section:\n  - Have you explained the full details of `Unique` at this point? You mention the dtor seeing it as an `*mut` pointer but it may not be so clear to the reader.\n  - \"Similarly nothing can use- after-free the ptr because the Box is immediately marked as uninitialized.\" I found this confusing -- I'm not sure what you're trying to emphasize here. In particular the fact that `drop` was running at all indicates that the box cannot be used directly any more -- so you might be more explicit about the scenario that's being protected against here.\n- Leaking:\n  - \"Many people like to believe that Rust eliminates resource leaks, but this is absolutely not the case, no matter how you look at it.\" This is similar to the claim that Rust \"eliminates races\" -- absolutely false in any purely technical sense, but with a fair amount of truth in practice.\n  - The description of the scoped API is a little incomplete for readers not already familiar with it. Could be helpful to discuss the basic idea of joining the thread via a guard first, before the code example. (Might also want to just paste in the basic signatures of the API).\n  - \"The thread::scoped API intends to allow threads to be spawned that reference data on the stack without any synchronization over that data\" -- this isn't quite right. More simply, the intent is to allow sharing stack data between a parent thread and some children threads, by ensuring that the parent joins the children before popping that stack data.\n  - Otherwise, this section is really great :+1: \n\nr+ on this section after above addressed\n",

    "body": "## Ownership comments\n\n### 4.1 References\n\n#### Paths\n\nAre you talking about \"ownership paths\" or \"lvalue paths\"? Rust does not attempt to semantically track \"ownership paths\" - in fact, Rust can work with references to objects owned by FFI code, with no in-Rust ownership path (also, in the presence of types like `Rc`, ownership paths are unclear). An object graph is a cleaner model.\n\nlvalue paths are the language concept tracked by `mem_categorization`. You can easily have zero (only accessible via a raw pointer), one (regular variable), or more (immutably borrowed) lvalue paths to a given object. lvalue roots are distinct from ownership roots (e.g. references are lvalue roots but not ownership roots in any interesting way).\n\nInterior mutability allows you to create a mutable lvalue path/reference to the interior of an `UnsafeCell<T>` given a immutable lvalue path/reference to its exterior and a proof that the mutable path is unique - it does not do anything with ownership paths (the main effect of an `UnsafeCell` is to stop the immutable path from propagating to its interior, which would cause an instant aliasing violation when its interior is accessed).\n\nOwning references/`&move` are kind-of a language concept that isn't completely reified.\n\n#### Liveness\n\nMight be worth noting that this is a distinct concept from GC-liveness.\n\n#### Reborrowing\n\nlvalues are frozen or borrowed, not reborrowed. A reborrow is just a dereference followed by a borrow. Disjoint lvalues may be simultaneously borrowed without causing aliasing violations, even if they have the same lvalue root (of course, this is only allowed by the borrow checker if _it_ can prove the lvalues disjoint, but this isn't UB in other cases if done by unsafe code).\n\n#### Aliasing\n\nOf course, aliasing is a matter of lvalue paths, not ownership paths. You can also have aliasing violations via FFI: if you modify, by writing, or any other way (`munmap`, `remap_file_pages`, DMA, etc.), memory accessible by a borrowed path.\n",
