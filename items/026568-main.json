  "body": "I found some typos in the upcoming 1.1 release note. I corrected them, but I wanted to go further. So I wrote a script that checks the integrity of the Markdown references, and ran it against `RELEASES.md`.\n\nThis commit fixes some trivial cases, but also removes the following \"unused\" references:\n- [`Iterator::cloned`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.cloned)\n- [`thread::scoped`](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/thread/fn.scoped.html)\n- [`Debug` improvements](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0640-debug-improvements.md)\n- [Rebalancing coherence.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1023)\n\nHowever, I think there's a possibility that these features might need to get descriptions as well. How do you feel about it?\n",
