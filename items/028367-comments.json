    "body": "- Similar to `HELP` and `ERROR` there's `WARNING` and `NOTE`. The only one that's handled specially is `SUGGESTION`, which must follow a `HELP`, since suggestions don't print with line numbers.\n- Codegen tests run with LLVM's FileCheck, which has its own directives\n- Several header comments are understood:\n  - `// ignore-X` where X is an architecture, OS or stage will ignore the test accordingly\n  - `// ignore-pretty` will not compile the pretty-printed test (this is done to test the pretty-printer, but might not always work)\n  - `ignore-test` always ignores the test\n  - `ignore-lldb` and `ignore-gdb` will skip the debuginfo tests (I don't know much about this)\n  - `min-{gdb,lldb}-version`\n  - And everything in [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/99383f8f5c276d8060f2105ff7e678c81bf4df05/src/compiletest/header.rs#L21)\n",
