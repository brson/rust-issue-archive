    "body": "Is there any reason this can\u2019t just be a function in the prelude? That would save a character at every invocation and would have the added advantage of being able to specify the type (e.g., `default::<int>()`). #18934 did something similar to this, although did not add the function to the prelude. (That was closed because it provided little use.) I think the best solution here would be add `Default` to the prelude, but I still don\u2019t really see what the problem is. What\u2019s wrong with simply calling `Default::default()`?\n",
