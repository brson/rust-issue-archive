I think though that the issue is quite old at this point, and it's possible that we're going to have globs as part of the language proper for 1.0 rather than removing them.\n\nIt does seem that the readability of the imports decreases with this sort of rewrite to not use globs, so we may want to hold off on this for now. Would you be ok with that?\n",
