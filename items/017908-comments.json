There are a couple of things interacting.\n\nOne part is that when you omit lifetimes within a fn body, we usually will insert defaults.\n\nAnother part is that there is lifetime elision within fn signatures. It is not entirely clear how this interacts with omitted lifetimes. Often the compiler can infer something, but not always, particularly not around bound lifetimes. I suspect we should give the lifetime elision rules priority, but I am not certain.\n",
