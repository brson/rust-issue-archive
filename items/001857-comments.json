    "body": "I think we want it. It gives a mechanism for implementing lots of stuff in library code (in particular, the scoped error handlers and dynamic variables I've been thinking of adding).\n\nThe API I have in mind is pretty simple.  It's a hashtable held off the side of a task. It's keyed by word-sized values (likely taken from the addresses of constants, which are conveniently unique per-process) and the values are (raw_ptr, crust_fn) pairs. The functions are finalizers. The raw pointers, we have no idea what they are. Likely unique boxes of our own choosing. The runtime finalizes the data when the task exits, otherwise user-code is responsible for any other structured get/put operations in this table.\n\nThis is an unsafe interface, would have to be used with care. Higher level conveniences (dynamic variables) would be built on top.\n",
