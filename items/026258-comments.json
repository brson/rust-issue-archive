I highly doubt there's a \"correct\" CRT to depend on and whatever we choose will likely cause pain for someone at some point, so not depending on one at all seems best.\n\nApart from the standard library we also need to worry about the small bits of C code we link into the standard library, any object compiled with `cl.exe` embeds which CRT it was linked against, so we need to be able to avoid that entirely.\n",
