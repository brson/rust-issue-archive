    "body": "There's been some debate on whether this feature should go forward. The main objection, I believe, is that the RFC brings into scope all items of the trait itself, but not any super traits. This is partly due to hygiene concerns, and partly due to the fact that the notion of a \"super trait\" is somewhat blurred with generalized `where` clauses. It may be problematic to have to sometimes write `Self::T` and other times `T`.\n\nPersonally, I think the ergonomic and readability benefits are worth it even if in edge cases the `Self::` is required. I would also like to be more certain that there are hygiene problems before we close the door to bringing in super trait items.\n",

I have no idea but would have expected it was more about expressivity (with some cost in terms of ergonomics). In any case, I'm sort of on the fence about this one. I think I find having the `Self::X` makes it easier to read and understand the code at a glance, particularly when there are a lot of other parameters in the mix.\n",

    "body": "After some discussion, the plan is (which we believe conforms to the [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0195-associated-items.md#scoping-of-trait-and-impl-items)): Within a trait `Foo` or impl of trait `Foo`, `\u03b1` and `Foo::\u03b1` are both shorthands for `<Self as Foo>::\u03b1` where `\u03b1` is the name of an associated type, method, or lifetime (this last not actually implemented yet). `Bar::\u03b1` is a shorthand for `<Self as Bar>::\u03b1` where `Bar` is a supertrait of `Foo`.\n\nIn the future, we expect that `\u03b1` may also be a shorthand for `<Self as Bar>::\u03b1` (assuming we can resolve implementation issues and potential issues with macro hygiene). Since this would not be a backwards compatible change we might look at making code where this shorthand would introduce an ambiguity an error. The error case is where the programmer refers to `\u03b1` in a trait or impl, that is valid today (i.e., is in scope for some reason other than being in the supertrait), and `\u03b1` is also an associated type or method of a supertrait, but not overridden in the subtrait.\n\nNote that within `where` clauses on a trait, the shorthands mentioned above do _not_ apply, only within the body of the trait or impl. (We could revisit this in the future in a backwards compatible way if it is an issue).\n",

    "body": "After discussing with @eddyb on irc, it sounds like skipping the `Trait::\u03b1` sugar is a good idea for now. Reason is it makes possibly global paths context sensitive (in their exact semantics, if not in the meaning of the actual name). While it's not clear if that is a bad thing, it seems possible that it is and thus we shouldn't do it without more discussion/motivation. He also brought up the case of methods in inherent impls which would be inconsistent with the scheme in the above comment.\n\nSo, a revised spec: in any trait or impl, where `\u03b1` is the name of an associated type or method, `\u03b1` in type or expression position is shorthand for `Self::\u03b1`. That in turn is a shorthand for: `<Self as Foo>::\u03b1` in `trait Foo { ... }`; `<Bar as Foo>::\u03b1` in `impl Foo for Bar { ... }`; and `Bar::\u03b1` in `impl Bar { ... }` (note than in the inherent impl case, `\u03b1` may only be a method name, since their are no associated types, for now).\n\nThis has the downside (as previously discussed in person) that referring to an associated type in a super trait requires the `Self::` prefix, but referring to one in the current trait does not. Therefore, it might be better to try an implement the shorthand for super traits too. It's probably worth thinking about if that is going to influence the implementation strategy.\n\n(I actually have this (as previously spec'ed) working for associated types, but was having some difficulty with methods. It sounds like I'd be better off rebasing or starting again over @eddyb's UFCS branch. Using his partial resolution abstraction for these things sounds like a nice way forward).\n",

    "body": "A key question here is what to do where an associated item could shadow an outer item, e.g.,\n\n```\ntype Foo = ...\ntrait Bar {\n    type Foo;\n    fn foo() -> Foo;   // <- which Foo does this refer to?\n}\n```\n\nThere are two options: we prefer the non-shorthand type of the module-level `Foo` or we imagine that the associated type `Foo` shadows the outer `Foo`. The latter seems the most expected behaviour, however, it is far more complex to implement. (There are a couple of other strategies too - we could consider this ambiguous and error out, but that has the same drawbacks, implementation-wise as preferring `Self::Foo`. We could prefer `Self::Foo` if the associated type is declared in the current trait, but not a super-trait (by using a more naive implementation strategy), but that is kind of awful). We also need to think about the expected behaviour for associated (static) methods.\n\nThe general implementation strategy here is that when resolving a path, we take note of whether `Self` is in scope (i.e., we're in a trait or impl) and if so we record two (well, n, really) possible resolutions - a partial resolution which assumes the `Self::` shorthand and a regular resolution (in the example these are the two `Foo`s). The former resolution is fully resolved during type checking, we then decided which resolution to use (this is something of a simplification, we arrange things in resolve such that if the partial resolution fully resolves, then it must be the correct resolution, otherwise we use the 'local' resolution). Note that the 'local' resolution may be no resolution at all, i.e., there is a resolve error if there is no `Self::` resolution.\n\nIf this all worked, then the shadowing behaviour would fall out nicely. However, there are situations where even testing for `Self::` shorthands causes an error, in particular, because of cycle detection (other cases can just defer the errors and fallback to the 'local' name resolution). For example, `num::Int` has a super-trait with a type parameter which has a bound of `num::Int`, and this is Ok because we don't need to fully resolve all the bounds to this depth in type checking as it currently stands. However, trying to resolve `Self::` causes us to do so and detect this cycle. The only way I see to solve this is to defer this error too - so if we try to resolve the `Self::Foo` shorthand and hit an error, then we fallback to 'local' resolution. If that fails, then hopefully we can give the cycle error rather than just a bland name resolution error.\n\nHowever, this seems kind of bad - by changing a parameter on a bound of super-trait (or something equally remote) we can cause name resolution errors in fairly unconnected places. Furthermore, whether you can use a `Self::` shorthand or not in a given trait becomes essentially unpredictable (you need knowledge of all parameters and bounds on all super-traits, etc.). It also seems really unsatisfactory some how.\n\nThe alternative is a slightly weird scoping rule that non-associative items in an outer scope shadow unqualified, associated items from an inner scope. This breaks local reasoning somewhat, i.e., you need to know the entire context of an item to know whether you can use the shorthand or not. And adding an item in an arbitrary place can break the use of a shorthand (imagine a glob import in an outer module). OTOH, at least you don't need to know about bounds and super-traits.\n\nThe implementation is also much simpler - you only need to worry about the `Self::` shorthand if name resolution fails otherwise. Furthermore, when finalising name resolution in type checking, you never need to fallback to another possible resolution, if finalisation fails, then you have an actual error (well, there might be more than one `Self` in scope, in which case you have to try multiple resolutions still, but we could simplify further and only take into account the innermost `Self`, which seems sensible since this is a shorthand and this is a kind of partial solution in any case because of the shadowing issue).\n\nNote that relative to current Rust, the first solution is backwards incompatible and the second is backwards compatible. If we adopt the second solution, changing to the first is a backwards incompatible change.\n",

I would rather forgo bringing the items into scope at all. (However, I still hope we can make the original semantics work out.)\n",

    "body": "I think in an ideal world that is true (about the names brought into scope), but I think we need to know the type parameters in order to properly know those names. This might just be for the impl case - that is, inside an impl, `Self::Assoc` actually resolves to a concrete type which may depend on a type parameter (e.g., `type Assoc = X::Foo` where `X` is a type param). There might be cases in the trait case too, I'm not sure. In any case the code treats both cases the same in this respect, @nikomatsakis would have to let us know how necessary that is.\n\nThe idea that we would just look at associated items in the current trait is what I call the syntactic approach. It comes down to only looking at the associated items which are lexically declared in the current impl or trait. I think it is still feasible, but I was persuaded that it was even less optimal that we thought and that the semantic approach (with either kind of scoping) was easier than I originally thought (ha!).\n\nMethods are an issue because expectations are a bit different, I think, it seems even more weird that whether you can write `foo()` or `Self::foo()` depends on whether `foo` is literally in lexical scope. Also because moving from the syntactic to semantic models is also backwards incompatible. I seem to remember I had other problems while implementing, but it was long enough ago that I can't remember them. Maybe I should continue along that track and see what happens...\n",

    "body": "I don't think I understand the cycle that @nrc is describing yet. Perhaps it's too early and I've not had enough coffee. However, the reason that we sometimes do want to know more type parameters is because we compile an assoc type reference like `Foo` or even `Self::Foo` to `<Self as TraitRef<T0>>::Foo`. If this comes from a supertype, we may need to do some substitutions and so forth to find out the trait-reference. However, it's...probably possible to defer this precise expansion to typecheck, but it's certainly more complicated, particularly with the current setup. (@nrc and I were saying that how we would prefer to implement this is to just have resolve build up the necessary tables and have the actual _lookup_ take place during type-checking.)\n\nAt some point @nrc and I discussed the idea of doing something that is ... mostly right now and then either reporting errors or having a known bug for the corner cases, to be resolved as we rework resolve. Not sure how viable that is right now.\n",
