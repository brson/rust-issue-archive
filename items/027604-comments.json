    "body": "Hi, I think Rust's strict type system is awesome and I'm not complaining about that. I'm saying that the error **message** is bad because it doesn't tell the user what the actual problem is (which is that they are trying to perform operations on two different number types). I knew that Rust doesn't implicitly convert numbers but I was still briefly confused when I got this particular error from the compiler. I imagine a new user would be lost and would have to turn to StackOverflow or the user forms to figure out how to fix the error. Giving the user one of these errors instead would let them easily understand what's going on:\n\n```\nerror: the trait `core::ops::Div<_>` is not implemented for the type `f32`\nhint: you cannot perform math operations between the types `f32` and `i32`\nhint: try converting the `i32` to an `f32`\n```\n\nor better yet\n\n```\nerror: you cannot divide an `f32` by an `i32`\nhint: try converting the `i32` to an `f32`\n```\n",
