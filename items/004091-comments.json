    "body": "Definitely still interested in this being part of the language. This is great.\n\nThe only thing that stands out is that I think we'll want slightly different syntax than the bit written in the RFC. Specifically: a `foo...` pattern should be written `..foo` (that is, use the DOTDOT token rather than ELLIPSIS, and parse it before the ident / wildcard subpattern, not after). This is to better integrate with / match existing syntax for FRU, range patterns and repeating vector-element expressions. ELLIPSIS is being removed from the language (it's only used for old-style macros presently) and the repeated element usually trails, to simplify parsing.\n",
