    "body": "@nikomatsakis brought up some interesting points on IRC that I didn't realize here. It turns out that today we actually cache cleanups for landing pads, for example with code like:\n\n``` rust\npub fn foo() {\n    let _a = Foo;\n    bar();\n    let _b = Foo;\n    bar();\n}\n```\n\nThere are two landing pads for this function from the two calls to `bar`, and both landing pads need a cleanup of the local variable `_a`. Today we only translate the cleanup of `_a` once, however, and the landing pad of `_b` will branch to the cleanup of `_a`. This is visible in the [generated IR](https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/88039f077021405754a9).\n\nA problem here, however, is that with `cleanuppad` this is not possible. The same basic block (e.g. the drop of `_a`) is being shared between two `cleanuppad` instances, so it doesn't clearly belong to either one to add a funclet bundle to it. This branch currently works accidentally by basically breaking the cache. For example the IR of this PR re-translates the drop of `_a` twice.\n\nI just remembered, however, that the [`cleanupret` instruction](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#cleanupret-instruction) can take a label to continue unwinding to. I believe we can use this to chain together cleanup pads in a way similar to how `landingpad`/GNU works. \n\nThis'll take some work to get working, but seems critical enough to get it done before landing.\n",

The gist of it is that if there are multiple entries in `popped_scopes` when generating landing pads, only the _last_ one will be used as a \"cached early exit\" for MSVC. With GNU exceptions all the intermediate ones will be used as well. This is because with GNU exceptions we can jump to any other basic block and keep going, but with MSVC exceptions we can't do that because each basic block can be a member of only one \"funclet\", so we have to be able to statically know which basic blocks are part of which cleanup pad chain.\n\nDoes that make sense? I fear that this is a little obscure and I have perhaps not commented enough, so please don't hesitate to ask for clarification!\n",

Earlier you hinted that there is in fact a way to chain funclets by \"throwing\" to another funclet or something like that\n(can't be bothered to look up the exact terms).

    "body": "So I was looking at the LLVM history today and there's been quite a number of WinEH commits since the LLVM revision I pinned this to. Many of them were specifically around verification of funclets, so I decided to update LLVM and see what happened. That update is not currently part of this PR, and I don't _think_ that it will be necessary, but I learned something interesting I wanted to share!\n\nSo far I ended up [just running into an LLVM bug](https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26147) during optimizing libstd, but it brought up a [very interesting comment](https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26147#c1). The gist of it (as I understand) is that a `call` instruction in a funclet which leads to unwinding is considered undefined behavior. Note that we have many `call` instructions in funclets (e.g. calling drop glue, and notably not `invoke`s), and destructors are definitely allowed to panic (although seriously advised against). We're safe from undefined behavior, however, because we can only ever be part of a funclet via a panic, and then a subsequent panic will abort the entire process.\n\nWhat this means, I believe, is that on MSVC it will be required for memory safety to have double panics lead to aborts for now. We can fix this by having funclets use `invoke` instead of `call` and properly handling a panicking destructor in a panicking destructor, but it's largely just something to keep in mind.\n",

I think I've come to the conclusion that I would want\ndtors to be \"noexcept\" (i.e., if unwinding reaches the dtor, it\naborts) as well, at least for consistency. I wonder if we can make\nthat change.\n",

Panicking (and thus unwinding from) in destructors is valid, as long as the panicking destructor is only called during regular cleanups and not unwind-cleanups.\n\nWe could make an RFC and a bunch of lints to forbid unwinding from destructors though, but I\u2019m not sure it is considerable at all as pre-2.0 material.\n",

Note that this is indeed true at runtime because a second panic rooted in a cleanup pad is a double-panic which will abort the process.\n",

    "body": "OK, so, I read through this branch again. I also talked some to @alexcrichton offline. Basically, I think we can do better with the re-use here. In particular, if you have four nested scopes, like:\n\n```\nSCOPE_A\nSCOPE_B\nSCOPE_C\nSCOPE_D\n```\n\nthen what I expect is that we should generate one LLVM \"funclet\" per scope, and use the `cleanupret` instruction to chain between them. What this branch actually does is to (sometimes) put multiple scopes in the funclets. What I'd prefer to see would thus look like:\n\n```\nUNWIND_A: \n    token_a = cleanuppad();\n    cleanupret(token_a, caller);\n\nUNWIND_B:\n    token_b = cleanuppad();\n    cleanupret(token_b, UNWIND_A);\n\nUNWIND_C:\n    token_c = cleanuppad();\n    cleanupret(token_c, UNWIND_B)\n\nUNWIND_D:\n    token_d = cleanuppad\n    cleanupret(token_d, UNWIND_C);\n```\n\nIn terms of MIR, it seems like we should basically adopt this \"funclet\" model -- marking basic blocks as either normal, or tagging them as \"unwind\" (and carrying along the \"funclet\" code, rather than making a fake value to represent it). This is trivially translatable to MSVC and trivially erasable to GNU (with branches).\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis ok I think I've implemented what we talked about. I added a few helper functions to `cleanup.rs` and I think it's a little cleaner how the changes were applied (and easier to follow the control flow). It's at least a little clearer to me now that the logic is basically the same and as much caching happens afterwards as it does before.\n\nThe IR [for a simple function](https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/15c06b98e122a12d707e) is [pretty awful](https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/82dad941d9b6710b9753) as you can see [cleanuppads are _immediately_ followed by cleanupret](https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/82dad941d9b6710b9753#file-foo-ll-L52-L53), as well as tons of branching via `cleanupret`. That being said, however, it looks like it's legal from LLVM's point of view and it also does [quite a good job optimizing it](https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/8bc67b8215a5caad6435) into basically exactly what one might expect.\n",

I've created two temporary commits in our LLVM branch\n   - https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm/commit/ae6a38329e0b40ed5a7bd1d31ffe0ba48ead1cc7 is a cherry-pick of https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commit/707c12c224206155ede6c172df8d264d43ddd4c1 which just isn't in the `release_38` branch at this time.\n   - https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm/commit/664319f7cca6374c320adf0ebe38305bca50ac68 is my attempt to get LLVM to compile on mingw-w64 by just not compiling any part of LLVM that needs `std::thread`. It looks like all portions aren't used by Rust itself at least. Note that this is similar to https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm/commit/0be2a329e6dff0b6996ab256e0c1d39da975a519 in that it's not our first \"let's make LLVM compile everywhere we need\" patch.\n2. As we're not using `std::thread`, I'm not upgrading gcc on the bots\n\n@bors: r+ 7f0d1f7fdfe65c1aa85a7bd7c81f2cf2617e0e02\n",
