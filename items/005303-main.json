  "body": "r?\n\nFollowup to #5022. This is the same, but everything is in `core::rt` now. `std::uv_ll` is moved to `core::unstable::uvll`, with the intent that it eventually move into its own crate (blocked on #5192 at least). I've had to disable the uv tests because of #2064. All of `core::rt` is disabled on platforms that aren't mac or linux until I complete the windows thread local storage bindings and ARM context switching.\n\nMy immediate next priorities will be to fix #2064 and clean up the uv bindings, get everything building on all platforms.\n",
