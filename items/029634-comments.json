    "body": "Ah yes, we've got three entry points. I.. think this is how they work:\n- First, `#[start]`, the receiver of `int argc` and `char **argv`. This is literally the symbol `main` (or what is called by that symbol generated in the compiler).\n- Next, there's `#[lang = \"start\"]`. If no `#[start]` exists in the crate graph then the compiler generates a `main` function that calls this. This functions receives argc/argv along with a third argument that is a function pointer to the `#[main]` function (defined below). Importantly, `#[lang = \"start\"]` can be located in a library. For example it's located in the standard library (libstd).\n- Finally, `#[main]`, the main function for an executable. This is passed no arguments and is called by `#[lang = \"start\"]` (if it decides to). The standard library uses this to initialize itself and then call the Rust program. This, if not specified, defaults to `fn main` at the top.\n\nSo to answer your question, this isn't the same as `#[start]`. To answer your other (possibly not yet asked) question, yes we have too many entry points.\n",

    "body": "Update on this, since it's been a while: I implemented the change, but it broke the test harness, which previously used the `#[main]` attribute in order to override the program's existing `main` fn. I explored a few other options, such as replacing/renaming the existing main function with the test harness, but it was pretty unwieldy. As I mentioned to @nikomatsakis over email, I think the best way forward is to either keep the `#[main]` feature around for internal use only (the easiest solution, but leaves the codebase cluttered with obsolete features), or to implement the test harness using `#[start]` (which, if I understand correctly, requires manually running some sort of initialization for `std`). What do you all think?",

Looks like the compiler error E0601 is currently misleading, since it recommends the `main` attribute, even on stable where it is unavailable at all. Probably we should drop the corresponding part from the error message at all, as it seems that this attribute is considered to be not for public use anyway.",
