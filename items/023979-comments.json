    "body": "Hm, I'm torn on the question of making `String` implement `Error`. My instinct, like @alexcrichton, is that `Error` is a meaningful designation that should only be applied to types that are specifically intended to represent errors, and that `Into<Box<Error>>` is a nice way of saying \"can be interpreted as an error\". But I'm struggling to say why, exactly, this seems important.\n\nFWIW, taking the step here does not preclude us from making `String: Error` in the future, so I think regardless we should follow this conservative approach for now, and see how the idioms evolve over time before taking the next step.\n",
