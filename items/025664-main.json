  "body": "It came up today that kate-config does not have a license file. I filed a [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/kate-config/pull/9) to fix that, but there are others.\n\n- [ ] crates.io-index - I'm not sure if this needs a copyright license since it isn't a work of creative expression, but it might still be worth putting something explicit in there just to fend off questions. Maybe there's some sort of 'open-data' license that's appropriate. https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index/issues/3\n- [x] blog.rust-lang.org\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/issues/63 CC-BY suggested\n- [x] regex - Declared in Cargo.toml but no accompanying license files. has dual Apache+MIT\n- [x] rfcs - This is a mess. It should have the MIT/ASL license per our other docs but we didn't have the foresight to do it. - https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1259\n- [x] rust-buildbot - now dual-licensed\n- [ ] meeting-minutes - Doesn't matter probably.\n- [ ] rust-www - This is tricky. It contains a COPYRIGHT file, but I believe we put it there to have a license to link to for Rust itself. We can probably argue that the entire website falls under that license.\n- [ ] Add Apache and MIT license texts?  prev.rust-lang.org#174\n- [x] rust.vim - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim/issues/45\n- [x] rust-mode -  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-mode/issues/91\n- [x] rust-packaging - contains licenses now\n- [x] ~~gedit-config - dual-licensed~~ (abandoned)\n- [ ] rustup - rustup.sh itself contains the license, but not the rest. and repo contains both license files\n- [ ] rust-installer - ditto\n- [x] ~~rust-wiki-backup - decommissioned partially because it was not properly licensed~~ (archived)\n- [ ] rust-guidelines - repo was decommissioned and moved\n- [x] ~~nano-config - Only contains copyright notice, not license Has both licenses~~ (archived)\n- [x] ~~zsh-config~~ (archived)\n\n## Update:\n\n- [x] [docker-rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust)\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust/issues/207 - https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust/pull/74\n  - [x] ~~[docker-rust-nightly](https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust-nightly)~~ (the repository has been archived, the licensing is now being done in docker-rust)\n- [ ] [crater](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater) mentions a license in README, even though the license files are not included in the repo\n- [x] [bors](https://github.com/rust-lang/bors): [bootstrap commit](https://github.com/rust-lang/bors/commit/bb146113e158f7764b78847cf833cd8f74cadc7d)\n- [x] [surveys](https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys)\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/issues/267\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/pull/266\n- [x] [rustc-perf](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf)\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1933\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1881\n- [x] [fmt-rfcs](https://github.com/rust-lang/fmt-rfcs): https://github.com/rust-lang/fmt-rfcs/pull/174\n- [ ] [.github](https://github.com/rust-lang/.github)\n- [ ]  [rust-lang.github.io](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-lang.github.io)\n- [x] ~~https://github.com/rust-lang/project-rfc-2229~~ (archived)\n- [x] ~~https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-debugging~~ (archived)\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-cargo-std-aware\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/moderation-team\n- [x] ~~https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-incr-comp~~ (archived)\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team-prioritization\n- [x] ~~https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-timing~~ (archived)",
