I originally wanted to yield `&[A]` but there's no way to do that safely. engla on IRC suggested that returning a `~[A]` instead of `&[A]` is actually ok because you can't move out of an `&[A]` anyway. But I think an iterator of iterators is even better, because you can just call `.to_owned_vec()` to recreate the `~[A]` approach.\n\nI'm going to close out this PR for the time being, I'll re-submit when I've implemented @thestinger's idea (not sure when though, as I'm going on vacation).\n",

    "body": "@thestinger Upon thinking about it, I think this may hit the same issue that trying to yield `&[A]` does, which is you can't put a lifetime parameter on the `&mut self` arg to `next()`, so your resulting value can't have its lifetime tied to the `ChunkIter`. And because of that, the yielded iterators cannot keep a `&mut` ref to the underlying iterator (at least, not safely).\n\nWhat it could do is buffer `n` elements into a `~[A]` and yield the `consume_iter()` from that, but that's rather pointless compared to just yielding the `~[A]` directly.\n",

    "body": "I am not sure if an iterator-that-yields-iterators can be done using the iterator trait and type system as it is today. As @kballard points out, it'd have to \"give up\" the underlying iterator temporarily, and the lifetime for which it would have to \"give up\" the underlying iterator is not known until you call `next()`, so it can't be encoded into the type you are iterating over.\n",
