    "body": "For consistency, enforcing normal module visibility rules on impls of traits makes sense, but I can't think of a reason it matters that much. From a library user's point of view, a private trait impl is the same as no trait impl.\n\nThe behavior of visibility on the anonymous impl should be considered too. I'm not sure if that's understood yet either or if it's assumed to be the same. Right now 'pub' does nothing on it I think.\n\nMy preference is that pub and priv everywhere mean module level visibility and everything is priv by default.  Currently fields and methods are pub by default.\n",
