In this specific case I would personally agree with @aturon that the `u8` distinction may just cause unnecessary casting. While `u8` is the smallest type that's big enough, there are still many invalid `u8` values, so we may not be buying much by using a semi-rare type (at least today it's semi-rare)\n",
