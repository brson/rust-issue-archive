    "body": "I run a simple benchmark with changed container growth rate: 2x to 1.5x\n\nExperiment setting:\n- Ubuntu 12.10, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3930K CPU @ 3.20GHz, 24GB RAM, 120GB SSD, both source code and build directory is on SSD.\n- compile rust 5 times with `make` command. It's better to measure time taken to build stage2 only, but I re-compiled all three stages, just for simplicity.\n- Compile time is measured with `time`\n- Two settings\n  - incoming branch\n  - incoming branch with container growth rate 1.5x (diff: https://gist.github.com/yjh0502/5097287)\n\nResult - average running time:\n- growth rate 2.0x: avg 790.01s, stdev 2.05s\n- growth rate 1.5x: avg 787.55s, stdev 1.64s\n\nHere's raw data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjFZD5XgU6lFdEhHM0hWTi1NQU9VcHdRVThmOGFub0E#gid=0\n\nCompile time decreases by 2.5 seconds, which is quite marginal in my opinion. Maybe we should test it with some well-known container benchmarks.\n",
