We could in theory bundle a linker for _just_ windows, which initially seems odd to me, but considering how our entire windows situation is a little odd (having a system requirement unlike other OSes) maybe it isn't that odd after all.\n\nI personally do not know how much we depend on mingw, but I would be _very_ surprised if our actual only dependency was on the system linker. It seems like we could have easily leaked in dependencies over time without knowing it, and I'm also unsure of how you'd figure this out (other than just building with something other than mingw and seeing what happens).\n\nI suppose all in all, I don't consider myself knowledgeable enough to say yea or nea as to whether we should be doing this at this time. Some things that I'd be worried about would be bundling too many dependencies (maybe ok for windows?) and preventing mingw dependencies from leaking into rust in the future. I'd also want to know that someone has a clear understanding of the path forward on windows away from mingw in the long term (I'm not sure if one exists today).\n",
