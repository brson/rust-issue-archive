    "body": "I'm not sure we really need the the division between limited and unlimited versions. After applying a few filters and chains one may end up with an iterator of unknown length that is nevertheless guaranteed to be finite. Should one call foldl with UINT_MAX or resort to 'unsafe' code (which does not actually perform any unsafe operation)?\nI propose making the '_unlimited' methods the default and remove their unsafety. People who wish to use some limit can use .take(limit) before invoking foldl/to_vec.\n\nIt seems to me that the comment on 'to_vec_unlimited' is incorrect, it suggests that it may never terminate but is in fact guaranteed to do so when your program runs out of memory.\n",

I can see the advantage of not doing this however, and the names/documentation could make this clearer.\n\nThe to_vec_unlimited documentation point is fairly pedantic, but I'll change it.\n\n(However, it looks like foldl and to_vec may not be landed in this patch anyway, due to IRC discussions.)\n",
