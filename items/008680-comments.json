    "body": "I just stumbled upon this issue while reading about Rust. I was curious about bitfields because I do a lot of embedded C/C++ code development and we use bitfields for expressing a UART connected device's state. The state is quite big but thanks to bitfields it is not too bad. It is very clean to mark the booleans, certain small integers and enums as single to few bits due to low memory constraints. I am not sure if Rust aspires to run on a device with 4KB - 16KB memory range but I would not use Rust if it required me to use macros to get single bit flags. Bitfields allow very high level code where macros make unreadable bloat. Where ABI/specific alignment compatibility is needed of course macros might be the only choice. Perhaps projects like Servo or otherwise future Javascript engines in Rust might internally use bitfields to save memory in specific cases. \n",
