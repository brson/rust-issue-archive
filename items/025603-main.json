  "body": "This commit removes the syntax diagnostic validation as it's been plaguing the bots for two separate reasons and needs a quick fix for now:\n1. It's possible to read the stale metadata of previous builds, causing spurious failures that can only be solved by blowing away `tmp`.\n2. The code does not currently handle concurrent compilations where JSON files in the metadata directory may be half-written and hence contain invalid JSON when read.\n\nThis validation should come back, but it should likely be part of a lint pass run at the very end of the build that doesn't run into consistency or concurrency problems.\n\n---\n\nThis commit is a revised version of PR #25592; this approach differs in that it continues to output the JSON metadata, so that the error index page continues to work (assuming that people do not accidentally put in duplicate entries in the meantime).\n",
