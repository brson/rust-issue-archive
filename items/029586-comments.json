    "body": "The parser should use `self.expect(&token::OpenDelim(token::Brace))` to verify whether, after the \"Fat Arrow\" (`=>`) [has been parsed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1b55d19479eabcb5d6cbda651187c7004aa28f7f/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L3200), there is an opening brace. If there isn't, it probably means that the match arm should be relatively short, a one liner even. From this, we can infer that _any_ error that occurs when doing [`parse_expr_res` (parsing the match arm)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1b55d19479eabcb5d6cbda651187c7004aa28f7f/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L3201) with a primary span in a line different to the span of the Fat Arrow is suspect. In this case the following span label could be added to make it clearer what is happening:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: expected one of `!`, `,`, `.`, `::`, `?`, `{`, `}`, or an operator, found `=>`\r\n --> src/main.rs:6:17\r\n  |\r\n5 |         &Foo::A => \"art\"\r\n  |                    - in the match arm starting here...\r\n6 |         &Foo::B => \"bart\"\r\n  |                 ^^ expected one of 8 possible tokens here\r\n  = note: is a comma missing here?\r\n  |\r\n5 |         &Foo::A => \"art\",\r\n  |                         ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe suggestion (the `note` above) could be provided when checking wether the span between `=>` and `\\n` could be parsed as an expr and doesn't end with a comma.",

Once you've written a test file that will be compiled, you run `./x.py test src/test/ui --stage 1`. This *will fail* as there's no `.stderr` file for your test to compare against. After this is done, you can run `./src/test/ui/update_all_references.sh build/x86_64-apple-darwin/test/ui` (if you're in macOS). This will create a new file `src/test/ui/token/<your test filename>.stderr` that will hold the text output of the compiler. Verify that it looks like what you expect and add it to your commit.

You can compare the line number for two spans. You can look at `self.prev_span` for the last consumed token and `self.span` for the currently being consumed token.\r\n\r\n> Afterwards, there's this logic: (`require_comma`)\r\n\r\nI don't know if you can use it as I think that the failure happens on the previous line and that in that case the method returns. If that is not the case, then `require_comma` would be appropriate to be used.",
