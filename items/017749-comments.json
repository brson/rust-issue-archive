If I wanted the box returned by get_t to have a lifetime linked to self, I would have specified explicit lifetimes.\nIt is also quite troubling that the behavior when using a struct is not the same as when using a trait.\nIs there a RFC explaining all this?\n",

Its interaction with generalized lifetime bounds is perhaps a bit counterintuive since having `'static` in output position is much more common in this case.\n\nThe rationale for generalized lifetime bounds themselves was to close a memory safety hole in the type system.  Since putting a structure in a trait box erases information about any references the type contains, it was possible to circumvent lifetime safety.  That information is now properly retained as a generalized lifetime bound, so the compiler can disallow unsafe uses while permitting safe ones where previously it could not distinguish them.\n",
