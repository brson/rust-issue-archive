Categorize why the tests are ignored.\n    - In particular, a lot have \"not a test\" comments, so they can be moved to `auxiliary` folders to avoid compiletest trying to build them.\n2. Decide how to fix them. A lot have more specific issues associated with them and those you can probably just ignore. The rest will be on a case-by-case basis; you can ask on Zulip if you get stuck. I think all ignored tests should either have an associated issue or be removed all together.",
