    "body": "Thank you so much for figuring this out, Patrick. I was pretty frustrated that I couldn't make sense of the problem before, and you cut to the heart of it.\n\nSome clarification that at least helps me: there's a very concrete reason why the ordering and the restriction are necessary. It's not that the type has unbounded size (all trees have unbounded size), nor even that it has infinite size. For example, with the type:\n\n```\ntag list { CONS(int, list); NIL(); }\n```\n\ncould still have finite size. CONS(1, CONS(2, CONS(3, NIL()))) is perfectly finite. But the problem is that it doesn't have /statically predictable size/, which is one of the key aspects of the Rust design.\n\nAs another example: in a sense, there's nothing inherently worse about the type:\n\n```\ntag void { VOID(void); }\n```\n\ncompared to the type:\n\n```\ntag void { VOID(@void); }\n```\n\nBoth of them are impossible to instantiate, so neither really threatens any kind of safety properties. But the first type has statically unpredictable size, whereas the second has a static size that can be inductively computed, thanks to the ordering you describe.\n\nSo in summary: by imposing a well-ordering on these potentially cyclic types, we recover an inductively defined, static sizeof operation.\n",
