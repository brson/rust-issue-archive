    "body": "The reason that this is happening is that generic code is instantiated in the client crate, and the client crate is not linking to ncurses.\n\nThis was an explicit decision as part of 2b9c7742b919d97dd2d720eef0c0785c799e9546 to stop propagating link arguments across crates. The reason for doing so is that if we unconditionally propagate linker arguments there is no way to have a build dependency that is not distributed alongside a rust library.\n\nI believe that this can be revisited after #10528 lands because that already adds back propagation to a certain degree (one which I am much more comfortable with).\n",
