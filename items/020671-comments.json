    "body": "@japaric My assumption that this would work was based partly on conversations with @nikomatsakis  after the initial RFC. In particular, we've discussed that `trait Foo: Bar` should be equivalent to `trait Foo where Self: Bar` in most respects, and from that one would further expect other bounds to apply. But currently these are not equivalent:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo<T> {\n    fn foo(&self) -> &T;\n}\n\n//trait Bar<A> where Self: Foo<A> {}  <--- this produces an error\ntrait Bar<A>: Foo<A> {}\n\nfn foobar<A, B: Bar<A>>(b: &B) -> &A {\n    b.foo()\n}\n```\n\nThat seems inconsistent and I don't know of any good reason for it. (And of course it's a pain to have to rewrite bounds everywhere when those bounds _must_ already hold.)\n\nI do take your point that in general we do not propagate bounds, but I think we want to head toward more propagation, as in http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2014/07/06/implied-bounds/ -- and I thought we'd already started down this road.\n",

    "body": "@japaric It is also my understanding (from conversations with @nikomatsakis) that this should work. It seems related to the generalization of bounds checking. \n\nOne of the annoyances I started purging from the compiler is the `ParamBounds` struct which is still used to store the super traits bounds declared on a trait definition. This is one of (if not the last) place where we still have special treatment of bounds (modulo my open PR). It is my hunch that the bounds checking code introduces all super trait bounds but doesn't do anything with the ones declared in the where clause. \n\nI think this is an important question to resolve generally because like @aturon it was my understanding that any super trait bound should be identical to bounding the `Self` type with the same bound. I believe Niko and I had talked about needing to make some more reaching changes to support this, and if I recall correctly it was around the computing of super trait bounds. \n\nIn my imagined scheme we should probably collect any Self type constraints and introduce them like we have been with super trait bounds. It seems this would be the simplest strategy, and avoids introducing a breaking change for anyone relying on the current behavior (esp. if this isn't resolved pre-1.0).\n",

Unless I'm missing something, that can't currently be expressed.  If we weren't talking about higher-kind bounds, I could add another free type variable `E: ExactSizeIterable<&'a u32>`, and then bound `T::Iter=E`, but that doesn't work because in this situation `E` would have to be higher kind, and there's no way to bound equality for higher kinded types that I know of.\n\nMaking the trait bounds propagate for associated types would allow me to express the exact same bound in a convenient way, as in my previous example.\n",

    "body": "There's at least one category of non-supertrait where clauses that should be elaborated according to an accepted RFC but are not.\n\nIn [RFC-0195](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/8e2d3a3341da533f846f61f10335b72c9a9f4740/text/0195-associated-items.md#trait-bodies-defining-associated-items) there's mention of where clauses on associated types (non-supertrait projections from Self?) being assumptions for user code (which translates to me as 'elaborated').\n\nWhile the exact syntax of the RFC is unimplemented, current behavior is that the placement of trait bounds on an associated type in both the trait where clause and on the associated type are equivalent. e.g.\n\n``` rust\ntrait A { type B: C; }\n```\n\nand\n\n``` rust\ntrait A where Self::B: C { type B; }\n```\n\nAre the same _today_ with respect to trait bound elaboration.\n\nThus **where clauses on associated types _should_ be elaborated** according to the RFC's specification when considered alongside today's behavior (\u00b1syntax), but they're currently not. For example, by my understanding, [this code on the Rust playground](http://is.gd/8yp6y9) should work, as the `From` bound could just as well have appeared in a production of RFC-0195's `WHERE_CLAUSE` for associated types.\n\nBeyond that it's further arbitrary decisions (e.g. I'd like to see the RFC's note on where clauses extended to where clauses on supertrait's associated types), but at the very very least defining a new associated type should be allowed the comforts of elaboration.\n",

The relevant predicate in the example I gave is a bound on an associated type defined within the trait (or, rather, an associated type within an associated type defined within the trait), which by analogy as given in my [previous post](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20671#issuecomment-167056607) should be allowed in the where clause for the trait itself.\n\nThe current supertrait-only behavior _seems_ like a cultural momentum phenomenon (or oversight, or what-have-you) rather than something following from the accepted RFCs.\n",

    "body": "As a relatively new Rust user I just ran into this and found it super confusing, and seemingly inconsistent; in fact, I assumed it was a bug and tried upgrading to `nightly` to see if it went away. **I want to emphasize that encountering this in the wild didn't simply feel like another thing that Rust doesn't support (cf. GADTs or arithmetic on type-level constants), but rather it felt strongly like a bug.**\r\n\r\n**As mentioned in the issue title, the distinction is that \"bounds on associated type are not super traits\", and \"only super traits are propagated\", but this is not a satisfactory answer from a (this!) user point of view.** Indeed, I didn't even have a precise concept of \"super trait\" in mind before I found the explanation here; the associated-type bound just felt like another bound.\r\n\r\nWhen I ran into this in the wild, I eventually reduced my \"real\" code to this minimal example (similar to other examples above):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait HasA {\r\n    type A;\r\n    fn get_a(&self) -> Self::A;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait Foo {\r\n    fn foo(&self);\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait Helper\r\nwhere\r\n    Self: HasA,\r\n    Self::A: Foo,\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn test1<T: Helper>(t: T) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was totally baffled that the `Self: HasA`  bound in the definition of `Helper` propagates but the `Self::A: Foo` bound does not. Syntactically, they seem to be of the same logical class, as two bounds in the `where` clause (even if only one of them is a \"super trait\").\r\n\r\nMoreover, it's super confusing that the function `test1` here doesn't type check, since usually asserting a bound (here `Helper`) on an argument lets you make **more** assumptions about the argument in the body of the function, but here it somehow makes the function fail to type check, even tho the argument isn't even used!!!\r\n\r\nIt took me an hour+ to reduce my \"real\" code to this simple illustration of the problem, where my actual usage is more analogous to the following `test2` function, which also fails to type check, for the same reason as `test1` above:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn test2<T: Helper>(t: T) {\r\n    t.get_a().foo();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\np.s. as [mentioned above](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20671#issuecomment-682628078), apparently this doesn't affect trait aliases, which hopefully means this is easy to fix? Unfortunately, I can't use `nightly` in my project, or I would just switch to a trait alias, since creating a trait alias was exactly my goal.",
