    "body": "I agree that it would be nice to get more feedback on the RFC and I understand that this isn't necessary for 1.0. However:\n- The RFC has received nothing but positive responses.\n- The RFC has been open and waiting for comments for several months.\n- The change involved is tiny (3 lines to the compiler) and should have no adverse side effects.\n- I keep running in to situations in which I have to fall back to heap allocation because I don't have access to `ManuallyDrop`. The specific instance that prompted this PR was me trying to optimize `BTreeMap`'s iterators to render #19796 unnecessary and needing `ManuallyDrop` to avoid allocation during iteration. I'd really like to avoid having extra functions like intrusive iterators in 1.0 Rust, especially not marked `#[stable]`, unless there is no good way to optimize the idiomatic alternatives.\n- I'm only exposing `ManuallyDrop` under `core`, not `std`.\n- All parts of `ManuallyDrop` are marked `#[experimental]`.\n",
