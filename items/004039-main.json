  "body": "r? @pcwalton\n\nThis is a module called `flatpipes`, which provides a generic pipe for transporting values that can be converted to bytes.\n\nIt can do several cool things:\n- Send all serializable types, including managed types\n- Efficiently send POD types\n- Send and receive over I/O streams, including stdio and uv network connections\n- Send and receive managed types over Rust pipes via serialization\n- Implements the base pipe traits\n\nThe primary motivation is to create a high-level interface for communicating with a sandbox. In particular, I want to create a compiler interface that supports either in-process or out-of-process builds. Most users, including our build system, will need a sandboxed compiler to recover from LLVM assertion failures and to encapsulate thread-unsafety.\n\nAs an example, the final commit includes a test case that treats another process as an actor over stdio.\n",
