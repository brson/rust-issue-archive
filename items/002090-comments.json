    "body": "It's always fine to add tests under `src/test` -- `run-fail`, `run-pass`, and `compile-fail` are subdirectories under that one, in which tests get placed depending on their expected behavior. Also, some libraries, including `os`, have a test module with tests annotated with the `#[test]` attribute. The tests I added work now (my issue had to do with the working directory being different on different buildbots -- not your fault at all!) and I'll be merging this shortly. Feel free to add more tests, and thanks for the patch!\n",
