  "body": "This is done in two steps:\n\nFirst, we make foreign functions not consider modes at all.  This is because previously ++ mode was the only way to pass structs to foreign functions and so forth.  We also add a lint mode warning if you use `&&` mode in a foreign function, since the semantics of that change (it used to pass a pointer to the C function, now it doesn't).\n\nThen, we remove by value and make it equivalent to `+` mode.  At the same time, we stop parsing `-` mode and convert all uses of it to `+` mode (it was already being parsed to `+` mode anyhow).\n\nThis obsoletes pull request #5298.\n\nr? @brson\n",
