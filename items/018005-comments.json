It is a useful library, and it is not clear what the concrete benefits would be of offering formal parametricity in Rust (which is what the current design and implementation of `Any` is breaking, at least as I understand it).\n\nSince there are useful libraries in the wild that use this, we plan to leave `Any` and `downcast` as stable.\n\nClosing.\n",

    "body": "@pnkfelix: If 1.0 is going to be released in a few months, Rust won't be able to have parametric polymorphism or provide stable ABI due to `type_id`. The ability to reason about generic code and perform high-level optimizations via rewrite rules is useful. The lack of parametricity is why function merging (type_use) needed to be removed and type ids are a big problem for incremental compilation / stable ABIs because nearly any internal change can alter them.\n",
