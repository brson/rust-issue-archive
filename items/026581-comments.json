    "body": "For Firefox we use `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6` in the environment. This is supported by clang, and overridden by the command line -mmacosx-version-min switch.\n\nI guess that would become #[cfg(macosx_deployment_target)] or maybe #[cfg(target_version)].\n\n``` man\nMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET\n           If -mmacosx-version-min is unspecified, the default deployment target\n           is read from this environment variable.  This option only affects\n           darwin targets.\n```\n\nTo match clang's behaviour here rustc would include two versions of the standard library and selectively link to the one with or without TLS based on this variable. This is still a step in that direction, though, so I'm fine with the proposed change. \"One distribution\" is definitely better for our use in Firefox.\n",
