    "body": "Thanks, matricks. It's interesting that you've made it copy n elements instead of n bytes. Can you make the docs reflect that, since it isn't identical behavior to C memcpy/memmove? Also, memcpy and memmove should have 'unsafe' in front of the function declaration, and not before the function block. This will make them unsafe functions.\n",

Perhaps the raw intrinsic should be bytes and rename the wrapper functions to something else to get a disconnection from the C api. Dunno, could bikeshed that one forever.\n",
