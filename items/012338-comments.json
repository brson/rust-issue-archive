    "body": "I'm not sure the hygienic label can work using renaming given the current macro expansion mechanism. Consider the following:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! loop_x {\n    ($e: expr) => {\n        // $e shouldn't be able to interact with this 'x\n        'x: loop { $e }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    'x: loop {\n        // this 'x should refer to the outer loop, lexically\n        loop_x!(break 'x);\n        assert!(false);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs far as hygiene is concerned, there are three types of labels:\n- those defined and used as part of non-macro rust program\n- those used as arguments for macro invocation\n- those defined and used as part of macro definition\n\nTo work hygienically, type 1 and type 2 labels are lexically in one group and type 3 the other. If they clash, one group or the other need to be renamed. The renaming can only be performed on a fully realized AST tree. The problem is, given the current macro expansion mechanism,  type 2 and type 3 labels are parsed together (in the macro expand function). After an AST has been constructed, they can no longer be distinguished from each other.\n",

    "body": "No, I believe you misunderstand how renaming works. The renaming is applied to every hygienically-treated identifier, and it definitely does not require a fully-expanded AST. Without getting into the really interesting details, in this example the outer 'x would get a fresh rename that applies to the macro argument before the expansion of the macro occurs. Things can get really complicated, but I believe what you're looking at here is one of the simpler cases.\n\nAgain, if I understand you, you can try this using simple let-bound variables. Is there something that would make labels different?\n",
