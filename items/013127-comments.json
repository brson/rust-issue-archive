    "body": "@alexcrichton `fill` turns out to be trivially expressible using `read_at_least()`, and in fact I reimplemented it in one line using that. So maybe we can just remove `fill()`. I think `read_at_least()` is valuable, though, because it's a single central place to handle 0-length reads correctly. Similarly `push_exact()` is expressed in terms of `push_at_least()` and can be removed, and `read_exact()` also seems rather superfluous as it's already just a combination of `slice::with_capacity()` and `push_exact()`.\n\nI'm also open to the suggestion of renaming it to `read_nonzero()` and dropping the `len` param, but then `fill()` can't be expressed using it and we would need to keep it around.\n",

    "body": "Hm, I'm going to try to put some thinking down into words, this is all just thinking out loud.\n\nBefore this change, we have this list of methods for dealing with a partial amount of bytes on a `Reader`. I'm omitting `read` because it's obvious that this will stay forever.\n- fill a `&mut [u8]`\n- push_exact on `&mut ~[u8]`\n- read_exact returning `~[u8]`\n\nAfter this change, we have this list of methods\n- read_at_least on `&mut [u8]`\n- push on `&mut ~[u8]`\n- push_at_least on `&mut ~[u8]`\n- read_exact returning `~[u8]`\n\nThis still seems a little sprawling to me, especially when I look at the types that everything operates on. For example, `read_at_least` pushes onto `&mut [u8]`, but the very similarly named `read_exact` returns a `~[u8]` (same for `fill` before).\n\nSome thoughts:\n- Do we want to continue to support the \"push some bytes on this vector\" pattern?\n- Do we want to continue to have methods that returned an owned vector? (`read_to_end` I believe is an exception to this)\n\nDepending on the answers, we may be able to pare down the API to\n\n``` rust\nfn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> IoResult<uint>;\nfn read_at_least(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8], amt: uint) -> IoResult<uint>;\nfn read_exact(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> IoResult<()>;\n```\n\nI like that this only operates on `&mut [u8]`. \n\n---\n\nA little bit of a ramble, but I'm thinking that these utility functions on a `Reader` may need to be reconsidered. I think I'm more than comfortable removing `read_exact` returning `~[u8]`, but I'm less sure about removing methods that operate on `&mut ~[u8]`.\n\nThoughts on this? @kballard, @brson\n",

But I only count 5 calls to `read_exact()` in our source, so maybe we should go ahead and remove it.\n\nAs for `push()`/`push_at_least()`, I would like to be able to remove them, but I think they're valuable. The alternative implementation is to create a vector with the desired length, pre-filled with zeroes, read into it, and then truncate back to the actual read amount. That's awkward, and slightly less performant due to the need to memset the vector (`push()` uses `unsafe` and uninitialized memory, which can be valuable when e.g. `read_to_end()` is calling it with 64k as the length).\n\nI could see removing `push()`, which I added mostly to balance out `read()`, but could be folded into `push_at_least()`. In fact, I think I'll go ahead and remove that, because anyone who wants it can use `push_at_least(buf, 0, len)`.\n",

Similarly, all of the helpers such as `read_byte()`, `read_le_uint_n()`, etc are useful. And I suspect `bytes()` may be useful too, but offhand I don't know how much it's actually being used.\n\nI'm wondering if there's any utility to splitting `Reader` into two separate traits, with `Reader` containing `read()` and `read_at_least()`, and `ReaderHelpers` containing everything else (implemented in terms of `Reader`). I know that default trait methods have made us move away from this style of traits, but it would serve as a conceptual simplification, between the core `Reader` methods and all of the helpers that are implemented in terms of it. Although one downside is this would prevent any individual `Reader` implementation from overriding the implementation of any of the helper methods (e.g. a string-based reader could theoretically override `read_to_str()` to skip the utf-8 checks).\n\nIn any case, I'm open to removing `read_exact()`, but I won't do so unless one of you think it's a good idea. I will remove `push()`, but `push_at_least()` is also useful, primarily because it wraps the unsafety necessary to make reading into a large newly-allocated buffer more efficient.

    "body": "@alexcrichton I think the rationale for this is to provide a convenience method that deals with zero-length reads. I'm not sure if @kballard has other use cases in mind. Though, now that I think about it, for solving zero-length reads, maybe `read_any` (same as `read_at_least(1)`) might be more appropriate.\nIMO, it is difficult to think about what `read_at_least` should do if we want to read 2 bytes, but there's only 1 byte left in the `Reader`. We probably want to return an error since we can't read as many bytes as we want, but then we need to include how many bytes we read in the error, etc. `read_any` would sidestep this problem since the user won't be able to tell `read_any` how many bytes to read. It will either just return the number of bytes read (guaranteed to be greater than 0) or error if it cannot read anything or encountered some other error along the way. Go doesn't have a problem with this since `ReadAtLeast` returns both the bytes read and the error at the same time.\n",

    "body": "Hmm, I didn't check to see what Go does. I'm actually vaguely surprised to see that `ReadAtLeast(r, buf, 0)` returns `(0, err)`. But that is indeed what it appears to do.\n\nI documented that the read is always performed because I wanted clients to be able to rely on it. If you don't want it documented, then I think it's better to not do the read when `min == 0`. The reason is I don't want clients observing that it always reads when `min == 0`, relying on that assumption, then breaking later if behavior changes (and if behavior never changes, then why omit it from the documentation?)\n\nGiven this precedent, I'll go ahead and change the behavior to skip the read.\n\n> perhaps an error should be returned rather than failing in these new methods?\n\nThe failure happens in response to a logic error, i.e. the client passing a `min` that's too high. Handling this as an error instead requires adding yet another `IoErrorKind` to indicate the buffer was too short. This is an error that seems like it will only apply to `read_at_least()` and to no other function. Do you think it's better to have this once-off error value than it is to simply fail on logic error?\n",
