In general, we plan on dissolving libextra soon to a conglomerate of packages (exact details yet to be determined), and this probably belongs in there. In the meantime, we've been hesitant to add more data structures to libextra as a consequence because it's just another thing which we'd have to figure out where to go.\n\nThis is some nice work though! I think we'll want to discuss this a bit. I've added this to the agenda for the meeting tomorrow.\n",

I'm thinking we should go ahead and add it since it looks nice and is self contained, and if it ends up living somewhere else then so be it. @ktt3ja the motivation for having an LRU cache is for use in servo, so you might ask the people in #servo where this can be applied, see if it fits their use case, then use it there.\n",
