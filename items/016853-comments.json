Basically, use `PartialVec` as a temporary place to move the `Vec` into, with the right `drop` semantics, but otherwise perform all of the work directly in `map_inplace`.

Personally, I think it'd make this code simpler and more clear.\n\nAs far as interleaving safe and unsafe code, I think most of `map_inplace` would be unsafe, and I think that seeing both the loop and the memory operations it performs in one place will make it _easier_ to validate the safety (because everything would fit on a single page, basically).\n\nThat said, I wouldn't block the PR on the basis of these preferences; my main concern is to hide `PartialVec`, which will give us the freedom to simplify things later.\n\nI would vote for `map_in_place` though, mostly because the convention is to use an `_` between each distinct word.\n",

    "body": "@tbu- Looks good to me.\n\nOne minor point: now that the `PartialVec` interface is private, the `assert`s within `push` and `into_vec` could be made into `debug_assert`s, and the functions themselves could be marked `unsafe`, with `map_in_place` guaranteeing overall safety.\n\nThis would expand the use of `unsafe` a bit, but it would avoid unnecessary bounds checking on every element.\n\nIn any case, I'm happy to r+ as-is, after a rebase; we can always tweak things later. Thanks for doing this work!\n",
