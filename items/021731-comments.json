There are also some intentions, if not concrete plans, to allow operators like `+=` to be overloaded (which is, I think the intended use here). I want to make sure we have a story that can fit all of these things together.\n\n@gsingh93, would you be interested in writing a broader RFC that could discuss some of the above issues (or even propose to add `+=` and friends)?
