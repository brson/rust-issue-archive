    "body": "We want to make interoperability with C/C++ easy. In fact, we depend on it already in rustc. To make that possible, a lot has to happen. I started working on this for linux and the some things I found\n\n*) We have to initialize pthreads, since those are the threads that rust is creating (probably a good thing).\n*) C++ code can have constructors and destructors. This requires special marker symbols/sections.\n\nSimilar issues exist on any OS. Implementing this would be fairly painful and brittle. We should then probably link the C and maybe C++ libraries and basic files in. Finding these libraries is not trivial. Linux distros put them in different places, if using mingw, it can be installed in different directories, etc.\n\ngiven all that, it is probably best to look at rust as an addition to a C/C++ development environment and use the tool that knows the needs of C and C++: the compiler.\n\nI will try to fix this by just running the compiler used to build rt for now then.\n",
