Mind that I had to force-update this just now, as there was an unused variable warning in the first version `:/`\nI'm running `RUSTFLAGS_STAGE2=-g make check` locally at moment. It will take a little before this is finished, but if it passes, we can be reasonably sure that there are no ICEs lurking somewhere in there...\n",
