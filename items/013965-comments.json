    "body": "a simpler short-term solution could be to avoid generating the files in the first place.\n- Easiest way to do that: Add either `ignore` or preferably `no_run` to the code blocks.\n- Slightly harder (but better for testing): refactor the code so that the graphviz testing parts are parameterized over their Writer.  Add a hidden code block that runs those with an in-memory writer.  Then add a shown but `ignore`'d code block that just contains a very short `main` that calls out to the functions from the earlier block.\n",
