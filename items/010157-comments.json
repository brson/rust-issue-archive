    "body": "@thestinger I don't quite know what you mean by \"functional difference\". In any case, I actually drew 3 distinctions: things that are interior to the type, things that are owned by the type, and things that are reachable. For many purposes (e.g. builtin bounds like Send or Freeze), reachable is generally all that matters. But for others, e.g. move-by-default, ownership is what is important. In some cases, like `@T`, both matters in different contexts: we need to run drop glue if we own the `@T`, but not if we can merely reach it (e.g., via a borrowed pointer like `&@T`).\n",
