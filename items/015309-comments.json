    "body": "After some minor sleuthing and discussion with acrichto, this is what I know.\n- The bug is caused by the reexported crate yielding the _wrong_ magic number in the `?gotosrc=xxx` argument.\n- The `?gotosrc=xxx` argument tells rustdoc's JS to find a link on the page with id `#src-xxx`, and open the link.\n- The reason the suffix exists is to support multiple `[src]` URLs on the same page, which is desired for the future.\n- See `src/librustdoc/html/static/main.js#732` for the JS logic\n- See `src/librustdoc/html/static/main.js#1264` for where the `gotosrc` number is written\n\nFrom the latter we can see that this number is extracted from a fairly deep hierarchy of objects. `self` is an `Item` as defined in this module, from which we are extracting a `clean::Item`, from which we are extracting a `syntax::ast::DefId`, from which we are extracting a `NodeId`, which is just a `u32`. It is unclear where in this process the incorrect id is set (or perhaps the incorrect `Item`/`DefId`).\n\nUnfortunately I'm out of my depth, and have other pressing matters at hand. As a shim to get correct behaviour, we could simply remove this unique id business until we actually need to support multiple `[src]` links.\n",

    "body": "I've analyzed this issue and this seems to be a fundamental problem with using `DefId` in the documentation. In the other words...\n\n**We should never use `DefId`s in the documentation because THEY WOULD CHANGE!**\n\nFor `liballoc` we used to pass `--cfg jemalloc` to rustc but not to rustdoc, so we were actually working with different ASTs. A fix on Makefiles or even #2206 may avoid this issue (as we are looking at the same AST then) but they are not a definite solution. I'll work on the patch which removes all uses of `DefId`s from generated docs.\n",
