    "body": "I totally agree. The current error messages are too vague. If one is not familiar with the language, it takes ages to figure out what is wrong. To give a concrete example:\n\n```\npub trait BufferMe {\n     fn from_buffer<'a>(buffer: &'a[u8]) -> Self;\n}\npub struct Buffer<'a> {\n    buffer: &'a[u8]\n}\n\nimpl<'c> BufferMe for Buffer<'c> {\n    // Lifetime 'a at the function is now shadowing\n    fn from_buffer<'b>(buffer: &'b[u8]) -> Buffer<'b> {\n        Buffer {\n            buffer: buffer\n        }\n    }\n}\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nGives the error message\n\n```\ntest.rs:10:5: 14:6 error: method `from_buffer` has an incompatible type: expected concrete lifetime, but found bound lifetime parameter &'a \ntest.rs:10     fn from_buffer<'b>(buffer: &'b[u8]) -> Buffer<'b> {\ntest.rs:11         Buffer {\ntest.rs:12             buffer: buffer\ntest.rs:13         }\ntest.rs:14     }\ntest.rs:10:55: 14:6 note: expected concrete lifetime is the lifetime &'c  as defined on the block at 10:54\ntest.rs:10     fn from_buffer<'b>(buffer: &'b[u8]) -> Buffer<'b> {\ntest.rs:11         Buffer {\ntest.rs:12             buffer: buffer\ntest.rs:13         }\ntest.rs:14     }\n```\n\nI named the relevant lifetime 'a, 'b and 'c to make my point. In my original code, they were of course all called 'a, such that I had no clue what was going on. \n\nThe first error message only gives a hint when you rename the lifetimes, but even then it is hard to figure out why he wants 'a and not 'b. It should be written where the lifetime 'a in question is defined. On top of that one should give a hint that the trait itself might be annotated with a lifetime as well. On top of that it is totally possible to shadow the lifetime of the trait with the definition in the function signature:\n\n```\npub trait BufferMe<'a> {\n     fn from_buffer<'a>(buffer: &'a[u8]) -> Self;\n}\n```\n\nIn that case a warning should be given that it is shadowed.\n\nThe second message is partially wrong because there is no &'c defined at 10:54. There is only a 'c introduced at 8:6.\n",

    "body": "So, this issue is pretty vague. It's true that we have room to improve errors, but since the OP didn't give any code, I can't see if it's gotten better.\n\n@nwin's has, though.
