  "body": "When using a generic enum type that was defined in an external crate,\nour debuginfo currently claims that the concrete type (e.g. Option<i32>)\nwas defined in the current crate, where it was first used.\n\nThis means that if there are multiple crates that all use, for example,\nOption<i32> values, they'll have conflicting debuginfo, each crate\nclaiming to have defined that type. This doesn't cause problems in\nregular builds, but with LTO enabled, LLVM complains because it tries to\nmerge the debuginfo for those types and sees the ODR violations.\n\nSince I couldn't find a way to get the file info for the external crate\nthat actually defined the enum, I'm working around the issue by using\n\"<unknown>\" as the file for enum types. We'll want to re-visit and fix\nthis later, but this at least this fixes the ICE. And with the file\nbeing unknown instead of wrong, the debuginfo isn't really worse than\nbefore either.\n\nFixes #26447\n",
