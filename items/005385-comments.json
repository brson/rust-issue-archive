    "body": "lol at the 'Clonable types are copied with the clone method' tautology. I'm assuming I wrote that.\n\nThis characterization of clone as a deep copy vs. the shallow copies that the language itself makes kind of surprised me. `clone` originally just meant 'the copy operator for things that require copy constructors'. In the current landscape, where Rust won't do any deep copies, I can see how you would want to frame `clone` as being for deep copies, but I wonder if that's an oversimplification.\n",

    "body": "@brson: I think it would be problematic if it had a different meaning for `@mut` types, because a generic function using `Clone` wouldn''t mean nearly the same thing. For example, an immutable borrow on an old clone would make the function fail if it tried to mutate the seemingly new object.\n\nA default implementation of deep copying for `@mut` would need to deal with cycles to prevent infinite recursion, and it would be a lot slower than a specialized implementation so that's another issue (deep copies of `@mut` _are_ something that will be needed though).\n\n`@` and `@mut` are directly comparable to immutable and mutable objects in Python, and their [copy module](http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/copy.html) exposes methods for shallow copying along with deep copying. For something like Rust's `DList` which uses `@mut` there's a distinction between the two and neither is implemented by default.\n\nI haven't really considered how this would apply to non-memory types which are generally only moveable, but still lots can be copied.\n",
