But if we were taking a stage1 or stage2 snapshot, we definitely want the version built with the stage1 or stage2 compiler, which means the lib version. (Of course, we want it to wind up as stage0/libstd.so and not stage0/lib/libstd.so.)\n\nI think that it probably does not make sense to build a stage0/lib/rustrt. Since calls into the runtime are generally inserted by the compiler and not called directly, the stage1 compiler won't depend on new runtime features since the stage0 compiler won't be generating calls to them anyways. I might be mistaken about how rustrt is used, though, so...\n",
