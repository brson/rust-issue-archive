But the key point is, unlike the `int` fallback, we can make choices about defaults that vary depending on the context.\n\nI do think that providing a default for `range` would recover a lot of the ergonomics of the `int` fallback, though. Do you think that proving _any_ default for `range` is a bad idea? Or just that we should pick a fixed-side default?\n",
