  "body": "The drop block has been deprecated for quite some time. This patch series removes support for parsing it and all the related machinery that made drop work.\n\nAs a side feature of all this, I also added the ability to annote fields in structs. This allows comments to be properly associated with an individual field. However, I didn't update `rustdoc` to integrate these comment blocks into the documentation it generates.\n",
