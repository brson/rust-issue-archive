    "body": "This is likely not a rust-specific problem but rather how you're compiling and driving the linker. Most linux distributions need libc to be linked in to have the necessary startup routines, and one may likely be missing from the binary.\n\nFor example, if you compile a similar C program you get an odd error:\n\n```\n$ cat foo.c\nint main() { return 0; }\n$ gcc foo.c -o foo -nostdlib\n/usr/bin/ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0000000000400144\n$ ./foo\nzsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./foo\n```\n\nEven if the `main` symbol is switched to `_start`, this still segfaults. In general a bare bones binary such as this is not meant to run on the host system as it's missing necessary library support.\n\nI don't think this is related to rust, however, so I'm going to close this for now.\n",
