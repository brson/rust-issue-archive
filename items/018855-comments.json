    "body": "Yesterday we were happy with `Duration::num_seconds() -> i64`. Today we need `Duration::num_seconds() -> f64`. That's the way life goes. But what is going to happen tomorrow? I like the idea to leave `Duration` alone and move `num_seconds` function in a trait:\n\n```\npub trait TimeSpan {\n    fn num_seconds(x: &Duration) -> Self;\n}\n```\n\nThen, implement trait for both i64 and f64:\n\n```\nimpl TimeSpan for i64 {\n    fn num_seconds(x: &Duration) -> i64 {\n        x.num_seconds()\n    }\n}\n\nimpl TimeSpan for f64 {\n    fn num_seconds(x: &Duration) -> f64 {\n        (x.num_seconds() as f64) + (x.nanos as f64)/(NANOS_PER_SEC as f64)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd finally use it:\n\n```\nlet d = Duration::milliseconds(1500);\n\nlet a: i64 = TimeSpan::num_seconds(&d);\nassert_eq!(a, 1);\n\nlet b: f64 = TimeSpan::num_seconds(&d);\nassert_eq!(b, 1.5);\n```\n\nIn general, it seems to be a more elegant solution. Though, a single `Duration::num_seconds() -> f64` is easier. \n",
