    "body": "I'm a little worried about the interactions between this and #27197, as I think that attempting to generalize these implementations is probably a good idea and don't want to gain too many impl blocks here. I think that using the generalization of `Deref` is a bit too powerful (and a bit unidiomatic), and as found in #27197 `AsRef` won't work as it's not implemented for smart pointers. Perhaps, though, the `BufRead`, `Read`, and `Seek` implementations could be generalized for `T: Borrow<[u8]>`? That's implemented for all smart pointer types and would give us `Cursor<Box<[u8]>>` for free (reading at least).\n\nFor writing, we could generalize over `T: BorrowMut<[u8]>` to get the `&mut [u8]` and `Box<[u8]>` implementations, but it would invalidate the current `Vec<u8>` implementation (e.g. it wouldn't allow the vector to grow). With specialization, however, we should be able to have this overlap.\n\nIn that sense I would be ok exploring using `Borrow` for the reading side of things and adding an explicit impl of `Write for Cursor<Box<[u8]>>`.  How does that sound?\n\ncc @nwin \n",

Furthermore `Borrow` has been implemented for `Box` only very recently (not in May at least) so it this really the appropriate `trait` for this task?
