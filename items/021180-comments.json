The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @huonw (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

You can find some more details in the [original RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/517), although a new one hasn't quite yet been made for the `std::fs` changes.\n\nIn short, however, we definitely want to support an operation like this! It will probably look different after the I/O RFCs have landed, but we'll definitely at least make sure this is possible :)\n",
