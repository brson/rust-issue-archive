    "body": "Yeah, I was on the \"less keywords is better\" campaign the other day but I've done some doodling with code that uses 'as' and it seems to read almost strictly worse with `.(type)`. Not sure why. Visually cluttered or something.\n\nI agree the precedence issue on `as` is a bit of a problem. Or rather, the fact that `as` introduces a clear switch-in from the expression grammar to the type grammar, but the switch _out_ only comes when we \"finish\" reading a type. For types with suffixes, this makes for an unfortunate interface point between the two grammars. Having some kind of terminator for a cast's type sub-expression would be better. I'd almost prefer `as::<T>(foo)` or something.\n\n(I guess april is syntax month, eh?)\n",
