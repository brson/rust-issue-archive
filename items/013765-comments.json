    "body": "+1\n\nI'm very interested in his library, partially because of some behaviors I don't like in Rust's iterators, for instance:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let mut foo = \"abcd\".chars();\n    let bar = foo.by_ref().take_while(|&x| x < 'c').collect::<~str>();\n    let baz = foo.collect::<~str>();\n    println!(\"{} {}\", bar, baz);\n}\n```\n\nI'd expect it to print `ab cde`. Instead, it prints `ab de`. @eduardoleon 's library wouldn't have the same kind of problem. Despite that, it would be a very interesting alternate approach to solve the problem all by itself, and seeing Rust being capable of implementing it would just be great.\n",
