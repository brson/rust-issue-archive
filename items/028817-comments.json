The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

I mean, currently, when readers follow the installation instructions indicated in the book, they end up with the current stable release, which is v1.3.0. Therefore I think it makes complete sense to update the text to v1.3.0 then.\n\nObviously, once the next version is released, the text should be updated again. If this could be part of the release process, as @leodasvacas points out, there won't be the need for manual updates  ;)\n",
