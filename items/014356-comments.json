    "body": "Yuck. The proposed workaround sounds fine.\nOn May 22, 2014 5:45 AM, \"Michael Woerister\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> It seems that there's a bug in LLDB that causes it to crash when the name\n> of an object file is exactly 16 characters long. Unfortunately we are now\n> running into this bug because of the file \"alloc.bc.deflate\" created during\n> the build process. I have filed a bug report about this [1], but in the\n> meantime this bug is present in every LLDB version ever [2], so I guess we\n> need to do something about it on our end.\n> \n> My proposal would be to check if we generate a filename which triggers the\n> bug and if yes, then just add an additional character to it (e.g.\n> \"alloc.bc.deflate\" -> \"alloc.bc.deflate0\").\n> \n> If somebody has a better idea, please let me know. Otherwise I'll\n> implement this next week.\n> \n> [1] http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19826\n> [2] Commit message by Chris Lattner: \"Initial checkin of lldb code from\n> internal Apple repo.\" :)\n> cc @alexcrichton https://github.com/alexcrichton @brsonhttps://github.com/brson\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/14356\n> .\n",
