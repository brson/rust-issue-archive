    "body": "I\u2019d like to `impl ToSocketAddrs for Url` in rust-url. The URL parser already differentiates DNS names from IP addresses: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-parsing. (And the algorithm is slightly different from `Ipv{4,6}Addr::parse` in some edge cases.) So I\u2019d like some way to look up a DNS name. `ToSocketAddrs for str` does this, but it also attempts to parse an IP address, which is redundant.\n\nI think a guiding principle in some other parts of `std` has been to (also) expose what the platform (~ OS + libc) provides without mandatory additional behavior on top, and stabilizing `lookup_host` fits in that principle. (It turns out that `getaddrinfo` in some libc\u2019s also attempts to parse IP addresses, but that\u2019s another story\u2026)\n\n---\n\nI think the return value of `lookup_host` should be (an iterator of) IP addresses, not `SocketAddr` with an arbitrary port number. This could be a reason to bring back `IpAddr` https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27801\n",

    "body": "The libs team discussed this during triage yesterday and the conclusion was to not move this into FCP just yet. I personally have a number of concerns about the API exposed here in that I think it's insufficient for exporting all the functionality we want and it's also insufficient for giving back all the information that we get.\n\nI would be interested in seeing this developed externally on crates.io and then perhaps move it into the standard library. For now the libstd support won't be deprecated until a replacement externally exists, but I may work on such a replacement in the near future if no one else gets around to it!\n",

It's shame that `IpAddr` was removed for \"not pulling it's weight\" despite people speaking up and saying they were using it. How much can something like that weigh?\n",

They always appear in pairs, e.g. `gethostbyname`/`gethostbyaddr` or `getaddrinfo`/`getnameinfo` in C.\n\nAlso, when it comes to DNS, I really want to use the system/libc functions, not a pure Rust solution (because of caching, NSS, system settings ...).\n",

    "body": "There hasn't been a lot of clear communication from the libs team on these APIs; sorry about that. The TL;DR is that no one is comfortable stabilizing these APIs as-is, and we prefer when possible to prototype and gain experience with this kind of thing outside of `std` first.\n\nLuckily, for networking in particular, we already have a crate for this exact purpose: [net2](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/net2-rs). It's a kind of staging ground for networking API experiments that are ultimately on track for `std`. @alexcrichton and I propose moving the `lookup_*` methods there for the time being, and starting to work out answers to the questions posed at the top of this thread.\n",

    "body": "I find the terminology here confusing. A lot of programmers need host name lookup, and they need to resolve host names according to the system configuration, which usually includes more than just DNS, and can end up performing exotics such as LDAP or NIS lookups. These kinds of lookups are limited in the types of data they can process (basically, just names, addresses, and, to some degree, host aliases).\r\n\r\nDNS, in contrast, offers a much wider range of record types, and a DNS API is required to get anything out of DNS which does not involve address information. But some names users expect to resolve on a system will not be resolvable through DNS, so a DNS API is not a replacement for something that ends up calling `getaddrinfo` and related functions.",

Right?\r\n\r\nSeems OK to me.  \r\n\r\n(Though it's a bit annoying: I'm already watching this issue, and instead I am now expected to watch future and as yet non-existent proposals somewhere else...)\r\n\r\n@fweimer I can't tell whether you're in favour of closing this issue, or doing something else, or what.
