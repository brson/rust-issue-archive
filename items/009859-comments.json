    "body": "- Minor detail: Note that Rust's annotation system currently only supports attaching annotations to items, not blocks.\n- I believe there is a fair amount of academic research on this topic.  I recall at least one paper that used an effect system to \"ensure\" that all the paths in a call-graph took the same amount of time.  I cannot find the reference though; I thought it was POPL 2000, but have not found it despite skimming some of the papers listed at http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/popl/popl2000.html\n",
