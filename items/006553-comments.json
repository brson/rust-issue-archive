    "body": "Triage visit: it would be neat if we could somehow implement it so that `==` worked perfectly on possibly cyclic structures, e.g. Python handles it fine:\n\n``` rust\n>>> L = []\n>>> L.append(L)\n>>> L == L\nTrue\n>>> x = [L, 1]\n>>> y = [L, 2]\n>>> x == y\nFalse\n```\n\nAt the very least, for `@` and `@mut`, using TLS and keeping track of the nodes(memory locations?) already examined, and substituting in the appropriate value for the trait being implemented rather than recursing again.\n\n(This would presumably have to be careful in the presence of a possibly-moving GC, but I'd guess that such a function call would freeze the pointers in memory?)\n",
