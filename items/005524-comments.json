    "body": "I'd like to see a test that tests something like `let x = [ ~\"hi\", ..5 ]`, to make sure the cleanups happen right.\n\nRegarding whether the temp cleanups are needed, I think they're needed in the case in which failure happens during a copy. I think that, due to the fact that copy constructors are not overridable in Rust, this can only happen due to OOM (which probably causes all sorts of bad things to happen in Rust anyway). So I think it's _probably_ OK to omit them, but it should be noted with a comment.\n",
