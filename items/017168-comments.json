    "body": "Guys, I terribly sorry and apologize, but it is my fault in the end - it seems that iOS was deleted from upstream, from `config.sub` file which caused invalid `configure` file to be generated. Looks like a mistake as iOS was deleted in commit related to OpenRISC cleanup. I've sent a new PR to `jemalloc` and will update once it lands. \n\nApologies again.\n",
