    "body": "@bblum So long as the stealing and thread spawning behavior is rate limited (i.e. after the spare thread sees one of the schedulers hasn't seen a yield in K ms), the scenario you're describing would occur only when a user is exclusively making non-yielding (i.e., no i/o, no sleeping, fully cpu bound) tasks. And that's the case where multiplying threads to equal tasks is _probably_ appropriate behavior: to saturate all the available cores with computation, as best the os kernel can.\n\nIt is possible someone will not want this behavior in some case. If they make so many cpu-spinning tasks the os literally can't handle the overhead, or perhaps they want a fixed number of rust threads even though they want to overload them. There are other mechanisms users can employ to achieve these ends in these cases. We decided on the strategy we did because it seemed like the more appropriate default, and avoids the worst problems (systemic taxes, artificial blocking or starvation). Most of the time, tasks do i/o or enter a potential yield point (say, malloc) regularly.\n",

    "body": "Somewhat off-topic: I don't think `malloc` is really a potential yield point, because with jemalloc it's lock-free for allocations under 4K and only hits kernel synchronization when it actually has to make a system call (allocations over 4K, and occasionally to increase the pool size for small ones). It's never really blocking.\n",
