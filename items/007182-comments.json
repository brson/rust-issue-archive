    "body": "@graydon I fixed the issue with the error messages and took the opportunity to clean up the ppaux.rs code a little and make sure that the parameterized lifetimes print properly. Originally I changed it to print `&'a Foo`, but it seems that isn't actually correct for that case, since it's actually a parameter on `Foo` not a region pointer. So it now correctly prints `Foo<'a>` and the tests reflect that.\n\nBecause of that, this code:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<'a, 'b, T>(a: Foo<'a,T>) -> Foo<'b,T> {\n    a\n}\n```\n\nwould produce an error something like: `expected Foo<'b,'a> found Foo<'a,'a>` which is confusing, so this also changes the way type parameters are printed by starting at 'T' and wrapping around to 'A' if the character goes above 'Z'. I made the assumption that if you have > 26 type parameters then you have bigger problems than seeing 'T' twice.\n\nIn short, printing a type like `Foo<'r,T,R,I>` produces `Foo<'r,T,U,V>` instead of `Foo<'r,'a,'b,'c>`.\n\nI also added the commit I mentioned to make count-llvm-insn stuff use task-local storage instead of being directly attached to the crate context, though the stats themselves are still on the crate context.\n",
