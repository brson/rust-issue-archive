But I think their existence can still be justified:\n- They serve as an excellent example for newcomers of how you can add methods to even build-in primitive types\n- They can be useful for function compositions\n- They are very low maintenance \n- They are good for example and toy code\n- Sometimes an `foo().is_true()` reads better, even if it is not necessary. \n\nIdeally we could just implement the freestanding functions as methods on `bool` directly once, and call them like freestanding ones using unified function call syntax, but we're not there yet. The lack of unified call syntax is also the reason why I kept both sets of functions and methods for now; otherwise they would become even less useful than they already are.\n\nIf those are weak reasons, I might also just remove them, but I don't see any harm in keeping them.\n\n---\n\nRelated, I added the `BitAnd`, `BitOr` and `BitXor` impls so that `bools` can be used in generic code that uses them. I though that was in general how we handle the situation with types that implement an operator natively?\n",

I think this is an ugly & pointless antipattern. (... this would also leave us with \n\n``` rust\nif (blah().is_true() == is_true(true)) == is_false(true.is_true()) { ... }\n```\n\nbeing legal.)\n\n> I don't see any harm in keeping them\n\nThey make this file 600 lines with a plethora of weird and wonderful and useless functions & methods, rather than keeping it simple, and the bool API really doesn't need to be huge and complicated like this.\n\n> I though that was in general how we handle the situation with types that implement an operator natively?\n\nThis is correct.\n\n---\n\nI'm not _too_ fussed about keeping the `.and`, `.xor` and `.or` methods, since they make the eagerness properties clearer, but I definitely think the freestanding functions and the `is_` functions need to go.\n",
