    "body": "Yea sure, look at this complete [doc](http://icorderi.github.io/kinetic-rust/doc/kinetic/proto/command/index.html). When compiling with `cargo build` (no --release) it wasn't showing:\n- mod log\n- struct GetLog\n- enum LogType  \n\nI tried it several times locally just to be sure. The doc built by Travis wasn't showing the correct thing either. I added the `--release` flag to [.travis.yml](https://github.com/icorderi/kinetic-rust/blob/master/.travis.yml) and it updated it to the correct content.  \n\nAlthough I can't reproduce it with my current code anymore. \nThe only thing all those had in common was that I had just wrote the imports in [mod.rs](https://github.com/icorderi/kinetic-rust/blob/master/src/kinetic/proto/mod.rs) and there was no actual code using them.\n",
