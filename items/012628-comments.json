    "body": "Looks like `BufferedWriter.unwrap()` fails if its `flush_buf()` fails, referencing this ticket (the same ticket it references when it decides to ignore failure in `Drop`). It's less clear how this method should behave. I feel like maybe there should be some way to request that the `BufferedWriter` flush without flushing its inner writer, so you can catch and handle any errors. If we had that, then having `unwrap()` fail on error seems ok to me as long as it explicitly documents this. But I don't think this means that `Drop` should also fail on error; using `unwrap()` is an explicit action, and the programmer has presumably read the documentation so they know it can fail (if they haven't, how do they know what it does?). But Drop is an implicit action that every `BufferedWriter` will run.\n\nRegarding flushing the buffer without flushing the inner, we should have some sort of standard name that all writer adaptors use. It doesn't have to go in a trait (because I don't think there's any use for a generic method to shallowly-flush a writer when it doesn't know what the writer is), it should just be a convention. Perhaps `.flush_outer()`.\n",
