I also want to be able to have child object initially set up its exception handler as a copy of the exception handler of the parent.  I'm pretty sure the \"obvious thing\" is to use objects instead of closures here, since the objects could obviously implement clone, but it would be nice to inter-operate with functions, even if only ones that can be &'static borrowed.\n",
