  "body": "librustc: Stop desugaring `for` expressions and translate them directly.\n\nThis makes edge cases in which the `Iterator` trait was not in scope\nand/or `Option` or its variants were not in scope work properly.\n\nThis breaks code that looks like:\n\n```\nstruct MyStruct { ... }\n\nimpl MyStruct {\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<int> { ... }\n}\n\nfor x in MyStruct { ... } { ... }\n```\n\nChange ad-hoc `next` methods like the above to implementations of the\n`Iterator` trait. For example:\n\n```\nimpl Iterator<int> for MyStruct {\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<int> { ... }\n}\n```\n\nCloses #15392.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
