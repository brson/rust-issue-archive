    "body": "I'm not sure it's quite there yet. The most obvious issue is that source code positions are not yet correctly set in LLVM IR in some very visible places (like if-expressions and function calls). This will easily (and understandably) lead to confusion among users (see #9641 for an example).\n\nAnother issue is that activating debug info doesn't seem to be compatible with activating optimizations (i.e. the `-O` flag). It's not always a problem but especially with `extra-debug-info` LLVM very often runs into an assertion when finalizing the module. I'm not sure yet what this is about. Is it because I'm doing something wrong with LLVM's resource management? Is it because we are uncovering a bug in LLVM that just hasn't shown in Clang yet? Or because it's just not supported by LLVM... (any insights on this --- that is LLVM/Clang and optimizations+debug info --- would be very welcome, @jdm @brson @thestinger @alexcrichton and other LLVM veterans)\n\nIn any case, for the time being I guess we should at least print out a warning when debug info and optimization are turned on at the same time.\n",

I know that @thestinger and others found this awesome tool in LLVM to narrow down bitcode files to something that we could report to LLVM, although perhaps it's just particular passes which interfere with debuginfo...\n\nRegardless, I don't think that we should promote this to a proper flag if we still cause lots of compilation problems with optimizations on. That being said, I'm perfectly OK with a warning being printed if you requested optimizations and debug info and then debug info is just not generated.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Thanks for the offer but, as you say, updating LLVM is unlikely to solve the problem. Better not invest any time if it's just for this.\n\n@thestinger Thanks for the hint. `bugpoint` looks very useful. However, if I remember correctly, the LLVM assertion occurs during the translation pass (in `DIBuilder::finalize()`) so we never get to the point where we have a valid `.bc` file. Or maybe I misunderstood how bugpoint/the _trans_ workflow works?\n\nI think the best course here is for me to spend a day or two to really dig into the assertion problem. Maybe I can allocate some time for that next week. For now I'll create an issue describing the problem.\n\nAs far as moving debug info out of the `-Z` flags is concerned, I still think that should wait until source code stepping is in better shape and we get no crashes with optimized builds. Or, if the optimization thing turns out to be more difficult than expected, the option with the warning about not mixing debug info and optimizations.\n",

    "body": "A little update on this: After 2 days of digging into it I was able to locate the issue causing the LLVM assertion about metadata still being referenced after deletion. It's a memory management issue in LLVM where some objects are never freed in rare cases. There is already a bug report on the same issue in LLVM's bug tracker and I added [some more details](http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16017#c3) to it in case somebody is interested.\n\nHow do we go about fixing issues in LLVM? Wait until they get fixed upstream? Fix them in our version?\n",

    "body": "Well, the fix I propose in the LLVM bug report will certainly get rid of the memory leak but I don't know enough about the inner workings of LLVM's debug info handling to know whether it would be better to solve the problem earlier. That is, instead of making the function resilient against duplicates in sub-program list, it would also make sense to dedup the list already earlier.\n\nI can try to make sure that we don't end up with duplicates in the first place (which, I think, is related to https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/7349). That would solve the problem on the Rust side and we would not have to wait on LLVM to fix the issue. \n",
