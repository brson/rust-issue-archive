    "body": "After some discussion with @aturon I feel a bit better here. It's true that the current code is not handling this scenario correctly, in a couple of ways, but there is a plausible way forward (described below). Moreover, for the short short term, I think I can make progress in my implied bounds experiments by filtering the predicates we add to the environment a bit.\n\nThe obvious way forward is to overhaul region inference so that rather than simply infallibly collecting constraints as it goes, it actually evaluates the constraints that it has at hand to decide whether adding a new constraint will create an insolvable graph or not. I have to do some investigation into the best algorithms here but this kind of \"live updated\" dataflow graph seems like something that has certainly been explored over time, so I'm sure there's a really nifty algorithmic solution that will be tons of fun to implement.\n\nThe other change that is needed is to modify the trait checker, which currently has a rule that says \"If I see two matches from where clauses, drop one of them\". This rule can probably be dropped completely given https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21968, but if not, it can at least be made more sensitive. This would imply that the calls above would yield ambiguous results until the inference graph is complete enough to select just _one_ of the where clauses.\n",
