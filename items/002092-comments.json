One possible design would be to create two enums, one in syntax and one in rustc:\n\n```\nenum Errors {\n    AliasedMutableLocationError,\n    etc.\n}\n```\n\nMake it implement a trait, `NamedError` that converts the enum to a crate ID (either syntax or rustc)and an error ID (the enum value).\n\nThen add a transaction API to diagnostics that takes a `NamedError`, then lets you emit any number of messages related to that error.\n",

    "body": "This is a great idea. I think it would be a huge help to programmers. Helping people understand _why_ something they've done is wrong by the compiler, as well as _how_ to resolve the issue, is an essential part of learning the concepts behind the language. A dedicated page for each error linked from the command line can allow us to elaborate on the meaning of the error, justify its existence, and suggest solutions much more effectively than a short text string. Resorting to StackOverflow implies that the compiler isn't able to clearly explain its own rules.\n\nIt may also be worthwhile considering passing parameters in the URL that encodes the user's specific instance of the error, so that the help page can tailor itself to the precise problem (i.e. using the same variable names).  I'm not sure how feasible that would be, though.\n",
