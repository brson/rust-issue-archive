But it preserves the low order bits without needing `asm`.  (we can put in asm versions later if warranted, but I agree with @alexcrichton that we can avoid it for now.)\n",

These days multiprocessor machines don't seem to use RDTSC for perf counters, so the actual frequencies we are likely to see will be in MHz, not GHz.\n\nBTW, your version seems to lose low bits too, and sooner than mine.

    "body": "@vadimcn by the way, I'm inclined to agree with your assessment on #17845 that this overflow seems like it could also hit the unix platforms as well.  (I guess there's something special about windows that I only hit it _there_ in the overflow work.)\n\nWe should definitely consider moving this portable routine that you have written out of the windows-specific code and into one of the core or std num modules, even if only for use within std alone...\n",
