  "body": "Closes #11692. Instead of returning the original expression, a dummy expression\n(with identical span) is returned. This prevents infinite loops of failed\nexpansions as well as odd double error messages in certain situations.\n\nThis is a slightly better fix than #12197, because it does not produce a double error and also fixes a few other cases where an infinite loop could happen.\n\nThis does not fix the other issue in #11692 (non-builtin macros not being recognised when expanded inside macros), which I think should be moved into a separate issue.\n",
