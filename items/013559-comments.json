We basically want to treat `@T` pointers the same way we treat `~T`. Longer term, we'd like to remove _all knowledge_ of how to deref `@T` from the compiler. I tried to prototype that but ran into a bit of trickiness around coercions, so for the time being I think you want to make changes like these:\n\nhttps://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust/commit/823f7bb883dc07f59d511220cfebd046cd0c69d0\n",
