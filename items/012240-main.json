  "body": "If you were writing to something along the lines of `self.foo` then with the new\nclosure rules it meant that you were borrowing `self` for the entirety of the\nclosure, meaning that you couldn't format other fields of `self` at the same\ntime as writing to a buffer contained in `self`.\n\nBy lifting the borrow outside of the closure the borrow checker can better\nunderstand that you're only borrowing one of the fields at a time. This had to\nuse type ascription as well in order to preserve trait object coercions.\n",
