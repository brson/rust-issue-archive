The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Many thanks to the author of this PR, but I am inclined not to accept it. I think instead someone should write-up an RFC describing a coherent policy, which we should then implement and stabilize. Speaking personally, I think that an RFC that can argue from some precedent (C++, Haskell, etc) will be much stronger than what which carves out a new space of identifiers, regardless of how good that space is (I am unclear whether this PR is carving out a new space or not, so I'm not implying anything about this PR per se).\n\nUPDATE: Edited to remove somewhat unfortunate phrasing.\n",
