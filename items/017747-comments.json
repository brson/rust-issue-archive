    "body": "In the error chaining RFC the return type of `Error::detail` is `Option<&str>`, yet in the implementing PR (#17753), the return type is `Option<String>` and remains this way. I think a string slice is better, as it prevents allocations in the common case where you store an `Option<String>`. I don't have very good internet access at the moment, but I could have a PR up in a few days if you think this change is worthwhile.\n",

    "body": "@michaelsproul The reason the API was changed was to support another pattern: that you _lazily_ perform the allocation and creation of the string, based on more meaningful fields that are part of the error type. But that does mean you have to create a fresh copy each time.\n\nIt just occurred to me that the best solution might instead be to use the `fmt` infrastructure; I left [a comment on an open RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/492#issuecomment-68191570) raising this question.\n",
