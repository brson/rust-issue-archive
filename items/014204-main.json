  "body": "The core library in theory has 0 dependencies, but in practice it has some in\norder for it to be efficient. These dependencies are in the form of the basic\nmemory operations provided by libc traditionally, such as memset, memcmp, etc.\nThese functions are trivial to implement and themselves have 0 dependencies.\n\nThis commit adds a new crate, librlibc, which will serve the purpose of\nproviding these dependencies. The crate is never linked to by default, but is\navailable to be linked to by downstream consumers. Normally these functions are\nprovided by the system libc, but in other freestanding contexts a libc may not\nbe available. In these cases, librlibc will suffice for enabling execution with\nlibcore.\n\ncc #10116\n",
