  "body": "The Ziggurat implementation of Exp1 is incorrect: it appears to have an\nexpected value of around 0.994 rather than 1 and the density of a large\nnumber of sample means does not match the normal distribution expected\nby the central limit theorem (specifically, it's a normal distribution\ncentred at 0.994).\n\nThis replaces Ziggurat with a \"plain\" inverse-cdf implementation for\nnow. This implementation has the expected properties, although it is\napproximately 4 times slower (56 seconds rather than 16 to generate\n1 billion samples).\n\ncc #10084 (this does _not_ fix it).\n\nRe-plot of the density estimate of 10000 sample means where each mean is over 100000 samples:\n\n![cdf-exp-density](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1203825/1415307/a39115f4-3ef2-11e3-9fd0-c3b532c3fe1d.png)\n\nClearly it matches far closer than the old implementation (cf. the plot in #10084, the scales are approximately the same).\n\nNote: I'm going to investigate & fix the problem with the Ziggurat implementation, this is just temporary so that the implementation is correct.\n",
