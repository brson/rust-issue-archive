    "body": "I need bulk DNS lookup for a project I'm working on in Rust, and would like to make a more fully featured DNS resolver.  If what I need overlaps with what would be acceptable for use in the standard library, that work could of course be shared.\n\nWhat's the scope of things that could be included in the standard library?  There's a few different things a \"DNS Resolver\" library could encompass:\n- A library for handling the DNS wire format\n- A souped up `getaddrinfo` (ie, blocking function) that can do arbitrary record types\n- A library for the host OS dns configuration: resolvers, hosts, search domains.\n- An asyncronous API for doing multiple simultanous lookups\n- DNSSEC / DNSCurve support\n\nBinding an external library like libunbound is certainly a possibility to get everything but the host OS config, but adds dependencies for Rust.  Any other way probably wouldn't include DNSSEC support.\n\nThe async API is most useful to me, as I'd like to have hundreds of DNS requests in flight at least.  But most existing rust APIs are not async, so I'd like some guidance on what's appropriate for inclusion.\n",
