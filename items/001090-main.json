  "body": "This fixes some important bugs in NaN comparisons (#1083).  However, there are some well-known issues with IEEE 754 semantics that we might not want in Rust, so this might not be exactly what we want to do.  See #1084 for discussion.\n\nThis also uncovered a bug in float::from_str that the tests did not catch before.  I commented out the failing test and filed #1089 to fix it.\n\nThis is my first real patch to the self-hosted compiler, and I'm still figuring out how things work.  Please don't hesitate to tell me if anything could be improved!\n",
