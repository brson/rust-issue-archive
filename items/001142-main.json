  "body": "llvm::mk_object_file should really return an option, since the underlying LLVM function can fail.  Fixes a crash on OS X when rust has bad dylibs within eyeshot.\n\nProbably other functions throughout the llvm bindings should also have option types returned when they could potentially return null from LLVM -- but this is at least enough to fix a crash in which a \"bad\" dylib (i.e., one that LLVM can't parse) causes rustc to crash.\n",
