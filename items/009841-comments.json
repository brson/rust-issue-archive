    "body": "Thanks for taking a look!\n\nImagine a hypothetical future Rust where we could write this function:\n\n```\nfn fromVecBare<'a, T : FromVec<'a>>(v : &'a [u8]) -> T {\n   FromVec::fromVec::<for T>(v)\n}\n```\n\nWould it be correct to make a fresh region variable when we are typechecking the call `FromVec::fromVec::<for T>(v)`?\n\nIt seems to me that the answer is \"no\", because the trait bound `FromVec<'a>` on `T` is explicitly constrained to use the region variable `'a` which is bound at the function definition.\n\nIn today's Rust, the only region variable allowed to be used by the trait bounds of a type variable bound at a function definition, like `T`, is `'self`. So `'self` will always be exactly the region we want.\n\nMore pressingly, with the current way of doing things, the typechecker rejects programs that seem perfectly fine to me, such as the motivating example at the top of this thread. I wrote out the error message here: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-September/005758.html\n",
