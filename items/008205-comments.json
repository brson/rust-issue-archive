    "body": "I/O to stdout is line-buffered by default, allowing writes to be atomic per-line, unless they're quite long. This gets the job done 90% of the time, which is what I would expect out of the default I/O system in a concurrent setting.\n\nMore flavorful guarantees about concurrent writes should be handled manually.\n",
