    "body": "btw, meant to ask this for a while - why doesn't Rust have an official LLVM repo? (and libuv too for that matter)   Having one would remove the need to re-point submodule origin each time someone does LLVM fix, and it would also enable submittal/review of PRs, just like it's done for the main repo.\n",

    "body": "It's pretty much agreed upon that having a rust organization on github (#9343) would be a good idea. That would indeed be the house for all our dependencies like llvm, gyp, libuv, etc. I think the reason it hasn't been done is that it just hasn't been done, there isn't really a particularly fundamental reason it hasn't been done yet.\n",
