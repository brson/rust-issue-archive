    "body": "> Any advice on how to test this fix?\n\nHm I think that compiletest does indeed check that all error messages are accounted for, but it must be using the same pattern to match the error message more than once. Some possibilities for adding a test could be:\n- [Fix `compiletest`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/19a39710c494d9300ffdc4e3f40dfda0ef62f7ba/src/compiletest/runtest.rs#L875-L909) to use a `// ERROR` directive at most once (this is probably the best solution).\n- Add a `run-make` test which uses `grep`, for example. This may be overkill.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Thanks for the suggestion. The problem seems to be that it only ensures that the initial compiler errors match all existing error patterns in the test file. After the error patterns are all matched, any remaining compiler errors get ignored. I believe I have a fix for this bug, but fixing it revealed over 100 broken tests! I am now going through the tests and trying to fix them.\n\nEdit: or rather, not broken, but tests that relied on not having to match every single error\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Many of the test failures were because of missing error messages, but you're right that some of these test failures are unexpected. A common example of such a failure is a test looking like this:\n\n``` rust\n// error-pattern: mismatched types\n\nfn f(x: isize) { }\n\nfn main() { let i: (); i = f(()); }\n```\n\nThis test began failing after the change, but it works if I remove the \"error-pattern\" comment and add a `//~ ERROR mismatched types` comment to the line containing `i = f(());`. It was specifically the \"mismatched types\" error, plus a couple others, where this happened multiple times, and I'm still not sure why.\n",
