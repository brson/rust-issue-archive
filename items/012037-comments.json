Without a catch block, that exception is propagated up the stack.\n\nThe semantics of the proposed `try!` here is \"run this code, and it might return an error result. The error is propagated up the stack via `Result`.\n\nI don't think it's important for the semantics to be identical; new Rust users know that Rust doesn't have exceptions, and the analogy is strong enough to put them on the right path.\n",

    "body": "My biggest complaint with `try!()` is that, when encountering it in code for the first time, it looks like it's going to catch task failure.\n\nOf the 3, I think `ok!()` is the best, but I don't think it's particularly good in the absolute sense. Maybe just `result!()`?\n\n``` rust\nfn foo() -> io::IoResult<()> {\n    result!(some_function());\n\n    let bar = result!(some_function());\n\n    if result!(some_function()) {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    match result!(some_function()) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt's not great either, but it doesn't have any preexisting semantic baggage, and for `let` and `match` statements it reads like \"let bar be the result of `some_function()`\". It also makes it obvious from the name that it has to do with `Result`s.\n",

    "body": "The goals that this macro has are twofold:\n- Indicate that the expression passed to the macro may be an error\n- Provide a hint that the return value is the value of the successful expression (or at least, not hint to the contrary).\n\nThe reason I like try! is that it balances those two needs better than the other options on offer:\n- While `try!` may have an association with a similar feature in other languages, that very association makes it clear that the expression passed to the macro may fail. In Rust, errors are indicated by a `Result` type.\n- `let file = try!(open(filename))` indicates that `file` is the value of the successful `open(filename)` expression as well if not better than the other options presented.\n\nMy concerns with the other options:\n- `ok!(open(filename))` doesn't really read with any obvious semantics. Not only will readers be forced to look up the semantics in a manual, but I believe that it will become hard for Rust users to form an association between `ok!(expr)` and the semantics we have in mind here.\n- `check!(open(filename))` clearly illustrates that the value is checked, but has at least a slight hint against the correct meaning of the value of the `check!` expression. It might easily be misconstrued to mean something similar to `unwrap()` or have a `bool` value.\n- `result!(open(filename))` is somewhat nonsensical because `result` is a noun, not a verb. It doesn't offer any hints about what happens to the expression or what the return value is.\n\nTo me, `try!` is still the best option I've seen, because it's a nice, short, one-word verb that I think users will easily be able to quickly learn and remember the meaning of.\n",
