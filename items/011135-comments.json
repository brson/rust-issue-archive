    "body": "This seems like an interesting lint, but in the FFI case I can imagine that this will warn about completely legitimate casts. The corresponding FFI types for integers in C often coincide with the current architecture's uint or int, but it may not if you cross compile for another architecture. This means in one mode of compilation the cast will be warned about but in the other it isn't.\n\nIn general I feel like lints should be encouraging you to improve your program or catching possible bugs, but this seem like a regular thing in some circumstances that shouldn't be warned about.\n",

    "body": "I think the problem @alexcrichton mentioned is similar to the problem related to macros. I think it would be nice to have an option to ignore typecasts in macros, although I don't have an idea how to do it at the moment. Does the AST, that's used by the linter, contain any information about expanded macros? As far as I understand, the macros are expanded at an earlier stage and the macro nodes are dropped afterwards.\n\nFor the FFI case, maybe an option to ignore typecasts with libc types would be useful?\n\nOr we could simply use `#[allow]`. This would be the easiest solution, although it would only possible to use it at function or a higher compilation unit level, if I'm not mistaken.\n",

    "body": "I've added tests for the three cases mentioned in the discussion above:\n- [cast with ffi type, no warning](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11135/files#diff-5ba8ac75cfe20c4934a0c420d1241503R1)\n- [cast in macro, no warning](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11135/files#diff-ffe3211f4065849e9e9ece847fa0143dR2)\n- [unnecessary cast](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11135/files#diff-1f324e2ca0f586e47c366683a1400926R1)\n\nDuring the last couple of days, I had a look into possible solutions for the problems mentioned above. \nTo avoid cast checks for ffi types (the types from libc), I use the type name used for the cast (https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11135/files#diff-1e2a5771a9e8a30cc0802838a4a9da9dR609). I check if the last part of the type name is one of the libc type names (at the moment I check only, if the type is `size_t`, but all other relevant types could be checked using a hashmap). This isn't the cleanest solution, because it only uses the last part of the type string, but I didn't find another way to check if the type is a ffi type.\n\nTo skip cast checks in expanded macros I added a [boolean flag the `ExprCast`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11135/files#diff-0de6e63ecfba5c83fb06c9e981f292a6R557), which is set to true for `ExprCast` nodes of an expanded macro. This is probably a very big change for a simple thing like a lint, but I found no other way to check, if an AST node is part of an expanded macro. If there is a better way, I would be happy to use it.\n\nBoth fixes probably miss a couple of unnecessay casts, e.g. if someone uses their own type with a name like `size_t` or something like\n\n```\nlet x: u64 = x;\nlet y: u64 = x as u64;\n```\n\nin a macro. This patch will probably require more work, but I would like to get some feedback about the direction of the patch.\n",
