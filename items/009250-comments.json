    "body": "I'm a little uneasy with this change in general. I think that the `deriving(FromPrimitive)` for enums is pretty awesome, but otherwise it doesn't quite sit well with me. It seems like a bit of a regression going from writing `BigInt::new(int_value)` to `FromPrimitive::from_int(int_value)`, and there's a lot of truncation going on in both the from and the to case which isn't well documented.\n\nThat being said, this seems like it might be a brainchild of discussion in #4819, which I haven't been following that closely. Is there an intent on using `{From,To}Primitive` in many use-cases other than the big numbers and in deriving-situations? In general it's a bit of a pain to explicitly call static methods on traits (it's not entirely clear that the trait is implemented for the type), so I thought we were attempting to avoid them in general.\n",
