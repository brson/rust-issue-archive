    "body": "@bill-myers That is a very good collection of points.\n\nI didn't even realize the symloop limit was configurable. Curiously, my manpage for sysconf() does not list _SC_SYMLOOP_MAX (this is OS X), although unistd.h does inded have it.\n\nIf libuv provides realpath functionality, using that seems like a good idea for libgreen. For libnative in POSIX, I agree that realpath() is a good solution. For Windows, I would suggest finding existing code that solves this problem (maybe even see what uv_realpath() does for Windows), because creating a file seems like a bad idea (or even opening one; resolving a path should work even if one does not have permission to read the file at the end of that path, as long as the ancestor directories are all readable).\n",

It's also quite complicated; it does some stuff with mountpoints, and has comments referencing chroot, so there's obviously some subtlety there we haven't even considered.\n\nIt also uses `MAXSYMLINKS` as the number of links it's willing to resolve, and that apparently has the low value of 32.\n\nGiven all this, it seems to me that we should use `realpath()` on POSIX and find some other existing solution for Windows instead of trying to write it ourselves. I'm also not sure what you mean by \"libuv does not provide `uv_fs_readlink`\". It certainly seems to exist in the libuv tree.\n",

    "body": "The manpage also says \"The resolved_path == NULL feature, not standardized in POSIX.1-2001, but standardized in POSIX.1-2008, allows this design problem to be avoided\".\n\nThe function is usable as long as either PATH_MAX is defined, or you specify NULL for `resolved_path`, which results in libc allocating the path with malloc().\n\nNot too sure on Windows, but I'd suggest to try to avoid writing your own at all costs.\n\nWindows has short vs long file names, UNC paths, NT vs Win32 paths, two kinds of symbolic links (junctions and \"symbolic links\") plus pluggable reparse points with arbitrary behavior, and at least one among junctions and symbolic links, when it is on a network path, will refer to the path on the remote machine even if it is absolute.\n",
