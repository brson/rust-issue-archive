Removing `~str` will presumably require rewriting `str::MaybeOwned` to use `StrBuf`, which should perhaps happen as a different commit.\n\nGiven the issues surrounding `MaybeOwned` and `MaybeOwnedVector`, I'm inclined to say that we should solve those first in a different PR, and then rebase on this on top. I'm assuming, of course, that getting graphviz support into the compiler is not critical at the moment.\n",

I can get rid of most of them, but for example, the `StrSlice::escape_default` method returns a `~str`, not a `StrBuf`, and so I might as well have the `LabelText::escape` method likewise return `~str`.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that there is a broader argument about whether to use `~str` or `StrBuf` (and that discussion is taking place on #13717).  Since I suspect that discussion will not be settled until sometime later than the point that I would like to land this, my plan for now is to avoid `~str` where possible, but keep using it where natural (namely in the `LabelText::escape` method).\n",
