  "body": "This method is intended to elegantly subsume two common iteration functions.\nThe first is `iter::repeat`, which is used identically to the method introduced\nin this commit, but currently works only on uints. The second is a common case\nof `{int, i8, uint, etc.}::range`, in the case where the inductive variable is\nignored. Compare the usage of the three:\n\n```\nfor iter::repeat(100u) {\n    // do whatever\n}\n\nfor int::range(0, 100) |_i| {\n    // do whatever\n}\n\nfor 100.times {\n    // do whatever\n}\n```\n\nI feel that the latter reads much more nicely than the first two approaches,\nand unlike the first two the new method allows the user to ignore the specific\ntype of the number (ineed, if we're throwing away the inductive variable, who\ncares what type it is?). A minor benefit is that this new method will be\nsomewhat familiar to users of Ruby, from which we borrow the name \"times\".\n",
