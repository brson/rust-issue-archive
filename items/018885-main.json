  "body": "The trait has an obvious, sensible implementation directly on vectors so\nthe MemWriter wrapper is unnecessary. This will halt the trend towards\nproviding all of the vector methods on MemWriter along with eliminating\nthe noise caused by conversions between the two types. It also provides\nthe useful default Writer methods on Vec<u8>.\n\nAfter the type is removed and code has been migrated, it would make\nsense to add a new implementation of MemWriter with seeking support. The\nsimple use cases can be covered with vectors alone, and ones with the\nneed for seeks can use a new MemWriter implementation.\n",
