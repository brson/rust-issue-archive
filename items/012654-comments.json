The only relevant pointer is the `*mut` one used for the box itself, which is already correct. You can't use it in a threaded context because it won't be `Share` or `Send`.\n\nIf the meaning of `Freeze` is changing, then `Rc`/`Arc` are far from the only types that need to become non-`Freeze`. Performing I/O is technically doing writes to memory... so deep immutability really means that all the methods have to be _pure_.\n",

    "body": "The current plan is to possibly remove the `Freeze` trait entirely (to be superseded by the `Share` trait). The main impetus for this change is that interior mutability is not done through `*mut T`, but rather through `Cell<T>`. For that reason, the counts should use `Cell<uint>` rather than `uint` directly through the `*mut` pointer.\n\nI don't have much of a preference on whether this uses `*mut RcBox<T>` or `*RcBox<T>`, although I would favor `*RcBox<T>` because it more accurately reflects that `Rc<T>` is not deeply mutable. @nikomatsakis may have some clarifications to this reasoning.\n\nImplementation-wise, it seems odd to introduce a one-off trait for these two pointer types. Sure it's not exported, but there's no other clean way to do it? I feel like something returning `&RcBox<T>` is the best way about this.\n",

I do think the distinction is useful, just as `const` is useful in C, because it does catch lots of mistakes.\n\nThe `const`-correctness rules in C++ are that you can coerce a non-`const` pointer/reference to `const`, but you can't go back the other way. In this case, it needs to remain `*mut` after the call to `malloc` because it is going to eventually be passed to `free`. It _can_ be coerced to `*` to pass it to a function that's not going to mutate it.\n",
