    "body": "@pnkfelix  you are right its kind of analogous. The problem with fail is you can't really react to it (like you could in other languages with exceptions) you have to prevent it so you need to put checks in front of every call you do just to let the function itself check it again.\nTo do this correctly you basically need to know what exactly each function is checking and replicate it. This is not even that trivial for simple functions like StrSlice slice which checks its parameters with this function.\n\n```\nfn is_char_boundary(&self, index: uint) -> bool {\n        if index == self.len() { return true; }\n        if index > self.len() { return false; }\n        let b = self.as_bytes()[index];\n        return b < 128u8 || b >= 192u8;\n}\n```\n\nI would not come up with that check and i certainly would not want to write this myself every time i call slice or any other method that calls slice internally (which are a lot). I don't think you should have to think\nabout that at all. The functions themselves know way better what to check than i do so why not let them handle the checking (like they already do) and give the programmer a consistent way of handling \"failure\" by returning Option or Result.\n\nI guess what i'm asking is a consistent way to handle errors through Option/Result instead of the current mix of some functions that return Option/Result and some you have to check the parameters before you do the call.\n\nFor the indexing and the slicing operator failure might be ok because you would expect that coming from other languages and it would be tedious to writing `a[0].unwrap()` but maybe if accessing a\nvalue that might not be there and therefore fail (like unwrap) hat some syntax associated with it it could be made easier to write. The easier option would be to let those operators fail and have some alternative functions like `get` and `slice` that do the same but return Options instead of failing so the programmer can choose.\n",

    "body": "I've been working on a set of guidelines for Rust, which includes [a section](http://aturon.github.io/errors/signaling.html) on signaling errors. It's a quite tricky issue!\n\nA couple of thoughts beyond the guidelines:\n\nFirst, it is possible to recover from `fail!` by using tasks. For example, you can create a child task with a channel connecting it to its parent, and have the parent use `recv_opt` on the channel to detect successful completion or failure.\n\nSecond, cases like incorrect indexing are generally thought to be programming errors. In particular, you avoid them not by adding redundant checks before each operation, but instead by programming in a way that naturally gives you valid inputs. For example, a traditional `for` loop over loop indices naturally builds in the bounds checking; you don't have to check prior to each indexing operation. Similarly for string slices: if you're going to index into utf8-encoded data, your logic should already guarantee that you're indexing at valid character locations.\n\nOne way to look at this is: if you did get an `Err` result back, what would you do with it? Since a bad index nearly always represents a bug, you'd probably either `unwrap` (gaining nothing) or just propagate the error up until a natural \"recovery\" point -- but that's exactly what task failure/recovery is intended to do!\n\nMore generally, it's _not_ a goal for all kinds of errors to be treated in the same way. A file not found error is quite a different beast from out of memory or index out of bounds. The guidelines linked above lay out some general classification of errors, and the appropriate way to signal them.\n",

    "body": "@aturon Thanks for the link. I know that you can catch fail on a tasks but i did not consider using a task just to catch a possible failure on a simple function to be a valid solution. Fail is currently used in a lot of places where other languages would throw exceptions. But fail is by no means an exception replacement if the only way to \"catch\" it is to use a separate task.\n\nHere are a few problems i see in the current description of when to use `fail!`.\n- input validity can be easily checked\n\nThis it true for a lot of functions that already return Option including Vec::pop. I can just use\nis_empty to test if i can pop or not. Checking that is even easier than making 2 bound checks before using slice.\nCalling pop on an empty vector is as much a logic error as trying to slice/index out of bounds.\nThe decision to make one fail and the other return Option is rather arbitrary.\nImmutableVector has a get method that returns an option so why is it ok here to have\nan indexing operation guarded with option?\n- parts of the API naturally produce valid inputs for other parts\n\nThere are of cause ways to get only valid inputs and not have to introduce redundant checks but\nthat's not always the case. For example if i want to parse some binary data and know byte 0 to 20 represent the header i need to do those redundant bounds checks, where if i would get back an Option\ni would profit from the checks the function already does for me and only react to the possibility that there\nmight be no slice from 0 to 20.\n- invalid inputs clearly represent a logic error\n\nlike i said before there are already functions that return None on a clearly logical error like\nImmutableVector::get or Vec::pop. \n\nI feel like the whole `fail!` is acceptable does not go well with the safety goals of rust. Programmers\nhave to read the documentation to see what functions can fail and why instead of being explicitly warned\nby the type system. Option and Result make it clear a function might not return a value or result in an\nError. If we would reduce the use of `fail!` to functions like unwrap where there is really no other way than to fail we would limit the code to audit for failure just like `unsafe` does for unsafe code. \n",

    "body": "@lucidd Regarding your point here:\n\n> For the indexing and the slicing operator failure might be ok because you would expect that coming from other languages and it would be tedious to writing a[0].unwrap() but maybe if accessing a\n> value that might not be there and therefore fail (like unwrap) hat some syntax associated with it it could be made easier to write. The easier option would be to let those operators fail and have some alternative functions like get and slice that do the same but return Options instead of failing so the programmer can choose.\n\nIndeed, both the original `~[T]` and the current `&[T]` (aka slice) offer a [`fn get` method](http://doc.rust-lang.org/0.11.0/std/slice/trait.ImmutableVector.html#tymethod.get) that returns `Option<&'a T>` precisely so that people who want to avoid failure can do so via that method.  The fact that the current `Vec` `fn get` [method](http://doc.rust-lang.org/0.11.0/collections/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.get) can fail is just a _temporary_ wart that will (or at least should) go away when things are working with the user-defined index operators so that we can start using `vec[idx]` again on `Vec` just like we used to with `~[T]`.  (Perhaps this is precisely the point you are trying to make; it is not clear to me from what you have written above.)\n\n---\n\nAs a follow-up to @aturon 's comment [above](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15535#issuecomment-48543643) (that I hope is consistent with the philosophy he is espousing):\n\nIf there exist functions in the stdlib that can `fail!` on some inputs _and_ it is not trivial to check the inputs for validity, then that is a real problem.  For _those_ cases, I think that we should change return type for such functions to return `Option` (or at least add a variant that does).\n\nBut I do not regard the examples in the description as instances of the above, since the `is_char_boundary` method is already provided on `StrSlice`, so you _can_ do this check, you do not need to replicate the logic within its implementation yourself.  (And plus, as @aturon noted, hopefully when you are manipulating a string's contents based on its byte indices, your program logic will make such checks unnecessary anyway.)\n\nIf there exist functions where the check is trivial but the methods for doing such checks are not documented, then we should fix the documentation to say how to do the checks.  `StrSlice` may be an instance of this, since i do not see in its `fn slice` [documentation](http://doc.rust-lang.org/0.11.0/std/str/trait.StrSlice.html#tymethod.slice) any mention of the `fn is_char_boundary` method.\n\n---\n\nAs I said [above](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15535#issuecomment-48431985), if we do add a slice operator syntax, then I would be much more amenable to making the non-operator methods return `Option<T>`.  Indeed, it seems like it could be somewhat reasonable to try to impose a design rule that non-operator methods should try to prefer returning `Option<T>` over failure.  (Although one would need to either allow for exceptions like `unwrap`, or add an operator for `unwrap`, which many have clamored for but we have for the most part resisted adding.)\n",
