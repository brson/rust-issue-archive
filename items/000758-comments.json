    "body": "This is because we don't treat methods like normal functions. Instead of representing them as a fn_pair, we represent them just as the function and track the object through a side channel. The function also takes an object instead of a closure ptr.\n\nI was hoping that I could fix this by changing translation of methods so that foo.bar got translated into the fn_pair (bar, foo). This would simplify translation of method calls, simplify things, and fix #435 for free. Unfortunately it doesn't work. Objects are represented as two words (vtable ptr and body ptr) whereas closure pointers are one word.\nSome modification of this scheme would be the prettiest way to solve this problem, but it might not fly with what we need for the rest of the object system.\n\nThe other approach is fixing #435 so that bind explicitly knows about binding object methods, and then automatically doing binds like we do for functions with type parameters.\n",

    "body": "Hm. Extending an existing object creates a new body that references the old one (and doesn't share the body like I had been thinking it might). That means that the vtbl pointer could just as easily be put in the body, reducing object pointers to a single word, simplifying method call handling, and making this this bug and #435 go away.\n",
