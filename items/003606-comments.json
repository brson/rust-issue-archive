The latter idiom is more familiar to imperative programmers, which I think many Rust programmers are or will be.\n\nStill, using `match` doesn't quite solve the problem, as it's still really easy to add a `None => fail` clause. Error handling and recovery is hard. To me it's a similar issue to how C programmers rarely check the return value of functions that might return an error, and those that do often just terminate the program when an error is detected. I have a feeling all the language features in the world can't make programmers always write robust software.\n",
