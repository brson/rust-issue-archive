Sadly, neither [rust-0.12.0-x86_64-w64-mingw32.tar.gz](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.12.0-x86_64-w64-mingw32.tar.gz) nor [rust-nightly-x86_64-w64-mingw32.tar.gz](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-x86_64-w64-mingw32.tar.gz) exist.\n\nAnd while I found the rustc nightly tarball, `https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rustc-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz`, I couldn't find a cargo one, `https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/cargo-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz`.\n",
