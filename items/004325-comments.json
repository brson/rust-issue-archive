    "body": "I think this never should have worked, since the `Node` struct is declared to contain a managed box. The error message isn't the clearest, but is saying the compiler doesn't know that the lifetime of the contents of a node's `next` field is the same as the lifetime of the contents of the node itself.\n\nI'll check in a modified run-pass test case (where the `next` field contains a pointer with a lifetime annotation).\n",
