The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @steveklabnik (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@Gankro Thanks for the feedback! I myself am learning rust, and your explanation clears up some things for me! It's clear that the line you've commented on is misleading and needs to be rewritten. I should probably add some of that awesome explanation as another commit! :+1: \n\nAlso, while we are at it, @steveklabnik: while I was reading the book for the first time it felt like there were multiple \"kinds\" of slices (string slice `&str`, array slice), but while reading arrays section (thanks to the line that says: A slice is a \"view\" into an array) it was getting clear what a slice really was. \n\nI think the \"slice part\" of the strings doc needs more explanation about how it's backed by arrays (or we should change the order of arrays and strings doc). What do you think?\n",
