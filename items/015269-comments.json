    "body": "> In this, `cx` is a `&mut ExtCtxt`, which @brson said was a linear type. There's something special in how these are handled in function arguments, apparently, which allows cx to be used twice here with `quote_item!` only when the first is inside a function call.  Why?  What is going on?\n\n`&mut T` can be \"re-borrowed\" for function calls.  The `quote_*!` macros used to not do this properly but I fixed that in #16992.\n\nIf there's still an issue here, please open a new ticket with a self-contained example.\n",
