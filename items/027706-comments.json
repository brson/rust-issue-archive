There may be multiple valid paths to get to something, due to symbolic links and such, but there is only one canonical path. Also, returning a verbatim path on Windows is the right thing to do, because the path is a valid NT path, and with the `\\\\?\\` prefix it is also a valid win32 path, but if the `\\\\?\\` prefix is removed, then it might no longer be a valid win32 path due to win32 having a few more restrictions on paths than NT.\n\nHowever I do wish that there was a way to get the canonical path of a file directly from a `File` and not just a `Path`.\n",

    "body": "@retep998 There's no such thing as a canonical path for a `File` in a unix-style filesystem.  Once you're down to a file descriptor, there's no telling what `Path` corresponds without combing through the filesystem for a matching inode number.  Even then, with hard links there may be multiple paths reaching the same underlying file, none more canonical than any other.  Or an open file may have no path at all if it was unlinked.\n\nEDIT: I guess Linux does have the original path symlinks in `/proc/self/fd/`, and BSDs can mount `fdesc` for something similar.  But I doubt Rust should try to expose this.\n",

Thus it's only use for us is to get the current directory for a specific drive letter when we're normalizing drive relative paths, when we eventually one day add a normalization method. Since it is bound by `MAX_PATH` and doesn't hit the filesystem we can implement all the rest of the logic ourselves.\n\n`GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` does handle all manner of reparse points, but it does not handle hard links. Therefore the documentation should clearly state this behavior.\n\nIf you want to know whether two paths point to the same file and account for hard links, you should use `GetFileInformationByHandleEx` with `FileIdInfo`, which provides a unique identifier for each file. Files which are hard links to each other will have the same identifier.\n",
