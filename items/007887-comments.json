    "body": "That (foo and foo_ref) was my original leaning, but then I thought about `.iter()`. The vast majority of the time, (I expect) people will want `ref_iter()` instead of `consume_iter()`. But maybe the syntax sugar will save us in that case?\n\nThe other qualm I had with that idea is that ARC `unwrap` should have a longer, more ominous name than `get`. But maybe we can keep the name `unwrap` for Option and for ARC, as a special case of implicit-consume that additionally means \"might fail, be careful\".\n",

    "body": "The challenge which approach do we pick for the shortest name? I converted `.map()` to consume because I found most use cases could be implemented with `.map_consume()` and I figured I'd change the shorter name to be the more efficient one. But since reference iterators are more general, it makes sense to keep `.iter()` returning references.\n\nWhat if we made the container's `.map()` consume, and use `.iter().map()` if you want the references? With mostly-working default methods, we could lift these implementations into some traits like this:\n\n```\ntrait ConsumableIterator<T> {\n    fn map<U>(&self, f: &fn(T) -> U) -> ConsumableIterator<U>;\n}\n\ntrait FromIterator<T> {\n    static fn from_consume_iter(i: ConsumableIterator<T>) -> Self;\n}\n\ntrait Mappable<T>: ConsumableIterator<T> {\n    fn map<U, Container: FromIterator<U>>(self, f: &fn(T) -> U) -> Container<U> {\n        FromIterator::from_consume_iter(self.consume_iter().map(f))\n}\n\nimpl<T> Mappable<T> for ~[T] {}\n```\n",

    "body": "@thestinger: By `O(nlogn)`, are you counting both the deconstruction and reconstruction of a container? If just deconstruction,  we can implement tree consumers in Rust in `O(n)` if take advantage of unique pointers. It allows us to violate the tree algorithm invariants to unfold the tree structure. Here's a simple `O(2n)` version to consume the tree:\n\n```\nenum Tree<T> {\n    Node(T, ~Tree<T>, ~Tree<T>),\n    Empty\n}\n\nimpl<T> Tree<T> {\n    fn consume_iter(self) -> ConsumeIterator<T> {\n        fn aux(node: Tree<T>, mut values: ~[T]) {\n            match node {\n                Empty => values,\n                Node(value, left, right) => {\n                    values = aux(left);\n                    values.push(value);\n                    values = aux(right);\n                    values\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        aux(self, ~[]).consume_iter()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt wouldn't be that hard to optimize away `values`, but we'd still need a stack to track where we are in the tree.\n\nRegarding persistent containers, I totally agree, and it makes total sense for their `.map()` to return references.\n\nRegarding writing consume for a mutable singly linked list, you would need an intermediate structure that stores the consumed items in reverse order. All you need to do then is unreverse them. It'd also be `O(2n)`. We could use dark magic to reverse the pointer directions to get it down to `O(n)` but I'm not sure if it'd be worth the unsafety.\n",

    "body": "@graydon: So `.map_move()`? I can live with that.\n\nSpeaking towards the bug, do we need partial forms of functions like `.take()`? We're starting to hit a combinatorial explosion of different function variants: by-ref / by-move / mut / default / map / expect. Instead I'd prefer if we just have up to 3 forms when necessary: by-move, by-immutable-ref, and by-mutable-ref. If we want a partial result, we can call `Some(~\"foo\").map(|x| x.to_str()).expect(~\"I expected some foo\")`. It does result in an extra `Option` allocation, but that should be both relatively cheap, and easy to optimize away with enough `#[inline]` attributes.\n",
