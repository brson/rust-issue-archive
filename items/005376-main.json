I haven't made any effort yet to clean that code up, however.\n\nThe second commit introduces `#[deriving(TotalOrd)]`, which creates an implementation based on the successive comparison of all struct/enum fields in their declaration order. A future patch will allow this to be configured in the attribute.\n",
