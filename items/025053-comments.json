    "body": "This libs team discussed this issue a few days ago and we unfortunately didn't reach a firm consensus. The [case I mentioned above](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25053#issuecomment-98447164) means that guaranteeing the safety of an `unsafe` block with an `UnsafeCell` would not also entail auditing all _copies_ in addition to accesses. This does, however, somewhat align with the desire for safe methods like `get_mut` (to get a `&mut T` reference).\n\nOne idea brought up by @sfackler was perhaps something like `unsafe impl Copy for T {}` where the type `T` is then copyable regardless of contents (but is clearly unsafe, hence the requirement of `unsafe`). This idea hasn't been played out too much, though, and would certainly require an RFC.\n\nOne other concern here is that if `UnsafeCell` implements `Copy` that it would also necessitate an implementation of `Clone`, which may be more dubious.\n",

    "body": "Another *possible* use case for `unsafe impl Copy`: https://github.com/bluss/arrayvec/issues/32\r\n\r\nThough it probably wouldn't be the best approach in that case.  In short, `ArrayVec` is a Vec-like type backed by an inline `[NoDrop<T>; N]`.  In general it needs a `Drop` impl to manually drop only elements up to `len()`, but ideally an `ArrayVec` with `Copy` elements would be `Copy`.  One potential way to do that would be a hypothetical `unsafe impl Copy` that worked for types with `Drop`.  Probably a superior approach would involve some way to bound the `Drop` impl on `!Copy`, though.",

    "body": "Discussed this a bit with @aturon -- I agree with the consensus that it would be easy to write broken code if `UnsafeCell: Copy`. Something like `unsafe impl Copy` is also appealing as an alternative. \r\n\r\nThis reminds me of the discussion around a `Pod` trait, which was supposed to be for \"things that could be copy, but where copying is likely a bug\". We would up at that time deciding against it -- having a *trait* made for a lot of sharp edges iirc -- but thinking that bugs might be well served by something analogous to the `#[must_use]` lint, which could warn about implicit copies of things you don't want to copy.\r\n\r\nStill, I feel like while having implicit copies *might* be dangerous from a race condition POV, it's also easy to imagine types that wouldn't have to worry about that. If my type is not `Sync`, for example, then it is fine to copy the data in the `UnsafeCell`. FFI might be another example.",

    "body": "This issue seems to be at a bit of a standstill.\r\n\r\n- On the one hand, there's a legit need for a `Copy` version of `UnsafeCell`, for things like FFI.\r\n- On the other hand, making `UnsafeCell` itself `Copy` is a potential footgun.\r\n\r\nIf we want to deal with both of these perspectives, we can rule out changing `UnsafeCell` itself. That leaves us with at least two options mentioned so far:\r\n\r\n- Providing a separate version of `UnsafeCell` that is copy (perhaps `VeryUnsafeCell` \ud83d\ude09)\r\n- Adding a mechanism like [`unsafe impl Copy`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25053#issuecomment-218610508)\r\n\r\nThe former is clearly the easier approach, and personally I'm hesitant to add special casing to the handling of `Copy` impls just for this particular case.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone strongly object to adding some additional version of `UnsafeCell` that is `Copy`?",

As I see it, the only reason to use `VeryUnsafeCell` would be if you want your type to be `Copy`.\r\n\r\nIn any case, `UnsafeCell` is already `!Sync`; assuming `VeryUnsafeCell` is too, a naive user of UnsafeCell will be blocked from accessing it from multiple threads to start with.  To get a bug, you need to either `unsafe impl Sync` or do something unsafe with FFI, e.g. calling a C function that writes to the pointer from another thread.  The former is asking for trouble, and the latter is not really an `UnsafeCell`-specific problem (there are all sorts of ways to create footguns out of C functions with weird semantics).",

    "body": "IMO, `VeryUnsafeCell` is probably the wrong name.  If there is a separate type, it should be specifically for `Copy` and named as such, e.g. `CopyUnsafeCell`.  It's not just a generic 'more low-level' version.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to motivations, I'm not totally sure it's wrong to just mark both `UnsafeCell` and `Cell` as `Copy`.  If I have `Vec<Cell<u8>>`, it really should be eligible for `copy_from_slice`.  If I have a `Cell` in my struct, it should still be usable in `copy_arena::Arena` and other APIs that require `Copy` for bookkeeping purposes (though arguably a better solution in this case could be to have a \"trivial drop\" auto trait separate from `Copy`).  But... if this is considered inadvisable, the only option is for me to make my own version of `Cell`, for which I cannot avoid `UnsafeCell` for the reasons specified in the original post.\r\n\r\n(sidenote: if `UnsafeCell` because a wrapper, people might be tempted to avoid it to improve the experience in a debugger, where at least IME you often have to manually traverse wrapper structs.  Maybe `#[repr(transparent)]` could help with this?  Or just use two lang items instead of a wrapper.  Ultimately the 'right' solution is to build rustc and Rust syntax into the debugger so you can just use the normal accessor methods, but that's probably a long way off.)",

What I meant to write is not that it shouldn't literally be called `VeryUnsafeCell`, but that that's the wrong *basis* for a name, I.e. the idea of being a generic 'lower-level `UnsafeCell`', as opposed to something with a specific use case in mind.\r\n\r\nRegarding making existing types `Copy`, to elaborate: I understand the worry about data races, but I'm not so sure it's likely to cause errors in practice.  `Cell` Itself is not really intended to be wrapped in `Sync` types at all; `UnsafeCell` is, but most code using `UnsafeCell` is probably generic and thus can't implicitly copy anyway.  And I can't easily imagine what sort of code would accidentally copy the entire cell.",

    "body": "@withoutboats The problem is that the `Copy` bound is special cased for a *lot* of stuff that is not easy to replicate with `clone()`, since it's known not to have a nontrivial destructor (among other things).  The issue isn't performance; there are plenty examples above demonstrating the issue.  Something like `Pod` would be preferable, but I'm not sure it would be easy to add at this point.\r\n\r\nEither way, as long as we're trying to make `UnsafeCell` a requirement for many kinds of unsafe idioms, not allowing it to be `Copy` is pretty silly.  The potential for data races is there, but you would have to write unsafe code to get that behavior (specifically, you'd have to opt into Sync, which already leads to data races both in theory and practice when you're not careful).  Moreover, since `Copy` has to be explicitly derived, there shouldn't be a single example of code that's correct today that would be broken if `UnsafeCell` was `Copy`.  And, frankly: even if an `UnsafeCell` is present in a `Sync` data structure, that still doesn't mean it shouldn't be `Copy`!  The `UnsafeCell` may only be used during initialization, or when the value is not shared with other threads.  I think the footgun potential here is being grossly overstated.",

I'd imagine it's rare for people to directly call the atomic intrinsics (especially on generic data structures, since at least last time I tried it they only sorta work on those), and without them it's kind of hard to come up with scenarios where you would be correct without a `Copy` but incorrect with one.

    "body": "Also!  Being able to byte-copy something when it's not shared really is a different use case from being able to byte-copy something when it's shared, and there should probably be a way to differentiate them.  It is annoying that one can't easily allocate fixed-size arrays of atomics, since (1) that's a very common thing to want to do and (2) the copies are perfectly safe, since there's no sharing until the array initialization is finished.  `Copy` is clearly a subtype of that hypothetical trait, since you can always share something you own.  And I believe assigning *that* trait to `UnsafeCell` (`CopyOwn`) would have no footguns at all, right?  You could also assign `Cell<T> where T : CopyOwn` `CopyOwn`, since copying an unshared `Cell` would be perfectly valid as long as the contents were not shared; this could be seen as a further weakening of the existing `MoveCell` stuff.\r\n\r\n(In general, I guess the analogy here would be `Send`:`Sync` as `CopyOwn`:`Copy`?  This doesn't really work though, since it's not the case that `T : Copy` <-> `&T : CopyOwn`; perhaps instead this is closer to the original idea for `Send` and `Sync`, where `&mut T => T copyable` <-> `T : CopyOwn` and `&T => T copyable <-> T Copy`, since in this case `Copy` would still be a subtype of `CopyOwn` [as you can always get `&T` from `&mut T`]).\r\n\r\nI guess my followup question would be: can anyone think of a reason they'd want to use `UnsafeCell` where `CopyOwn` was *not* sufficient (i.e., where you want full-blown `Copy`)?  I think I still can (the \"`UnsafeCell` is only written to at times when a race is impossible\" case, which in a single-threaded context doesn't necessarily correspond to times that the `UnsafeCell` is uniquely owned) so the need for something like `CopyOwn` is probably a completely distinct issue.",

    "body": "Thanks for the comments @pythonesque! I don't think I quite understand the significance of the section @aturon quoted, but I think it makes sense to look at these concerns in real-world scenarios. For example I've used `UnsafeCell` a lot before in threaded contexts, but there's usually and `AtomicUsize` right next to it to guard access to the `UnsafeCell`. In that sense an outer `#[derive(Copy)]` would already be forbidden because the atomic isn't `Copy`. I think I'd be convinced on \"this footgun exists but in practice rarely comes up\".\r\n\r\nOne point, reading over this thread though, which was [brought up earlier](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25053#issuecomment-218610508) is that an implementation of `Copy` would necessitate an implementation of `Clone`. What would that look like?",

    "body": "@aturon here you go:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, `UnsafeCell` is obviously not a safe abstraction, so it is a little hard to answer this question from a semantic perspective. `Cell` clearly could be copy (that's intuitively rather clear, it is `!Sync`, after all; also, we've proven this to be the case). For `Cell` to be `Copy` one day (if we ever want to do that), `UnsafeCell` needs to be `Copy` or there has to be an `unsafe impl Copy`.\r\n\r\nI like @pythonesque's point about `CopyOwn`. Semantically speaking, `T: Copy` really provides two properties (and indeed, proving a type `Copy` in our formalism requires both of these to be established separately, neither of them sees to imply the other):\r\n1. If you *own* a `T`, you can copy the bytes and then you own two `T`. (Somewhat like @ubsan's `duplicate`, except that it's type is somewhat too weak -- you'd want to say that `self` does not get modified, and really moving your original `T` around is unnecessary operationally speaking.)\r\n2. If you have a *shared* `T`, i.e. if you own `&T`, you can dereference that pointer and make a copy of the bytes and you have a `T`.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, `CopyOwn` is supposed to only provide the first guarantee. That sounds like a very reasonable thing to do for `UnsafeCell`; after all, `UnsafeCell` is only magic when shared, not when owned. `Cell`, `RefCell`, `RwLock` and friends could all be `CopyOwn` (if their inner type is). Maybe this is what the `Pod` trait was supposed to express?\r\n\r\nThe second guarantee, however, is a problem. Clearly many usecases of `UnsafeCell` violate it (`RefCell` and all the concurrency primitives come to my mind). @alexcrichton brought up the fact that `Copy` implies `Clone`, which is related to the second guarantee. `UnsafeCell::clone` sounds just wrong, that's a *safe* function that does unsynchronized reads from a shared `UnsafeCell`.\r\n\r\nI like `unsafe impl Copy` independently of this because really, `Copy` is not all that different from `Send` and `Sync` -- they can all be satisfied for reasons the compiler does not understand. Maybe someone using `Cell` wants their type to be `Copy`; they would need such an `unsafe impl`.\r\n\r\nHowever, `CopyOwn`/`Pod` can go way further than this -- most (all?) interior mutability types could be `CopyOwn`, which from what I understand would make more (like array initialization) compile and could even help performance. It also nicely aligns with our semantic model, so I'm a big fan of this right now. :D",

The reason is that (1) is an *implication*, saying that every possible way to justify the assertion \"we own these bytes at type `T`\" cannot possibly be making any exclusive \"ownership\"-style assumptions beyond owning these bytes. It has to all be duplicable. \"ownership\" here, as is common in correctness proofs of concurrent (and even sequential) programs, includes not only ownership of bytes in memory but also ownership of \"ghost state\", which is additional state that is tracked for the purpose of the proof but not actually present in the machine (e.g., this could be tracking which thread currently has \"acquired\" a `RefCell` even though no such tracking happens in the actual code). Property (2), on the other hand, is not a mere implication; we allow the proof of this to perform *changes* to the ghost state before producing a proof that the copy of the bytes is a new `T`. Since (1) must not make such changes, it cannot use (2).\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, I am not sure if we ever rely on (1) not making such changes. It certainly makes working with this much simpler though...",
