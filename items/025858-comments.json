    "body": "No, that has always worked, I assume because rustc does the linking in that case. The gecko build calls `rustc --create-type staticlib foo.rs` which has also always worked. The error comes when the gecko build later invokes Apple's `ld` with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 set in the environment to link the resulting libfoo.a into the C++ library which calls it. It recongnizes the TLS segments (or whatever it is in mach-o) and balks.\n\nSo:\n- Checked out the current rust-lang/rust master\n- Applied this PR\n- `./configure --prefix=${HOME}/.local/rust-notls --disable-elf-tls`\n- `make -j8 && make install`\n- `export PATH=$PATH:${HOME}/.local/rust-notls/bin`\n- `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/.local/rust-notls`\n- Checkout mozilla/gecko-dev master\n- `echo --enable-rust >> mozconfig`\n- Hack configure do disable the rust+10.6 interlock\n- `./mach build`\n- `./mach gtest rust.*`\n",
