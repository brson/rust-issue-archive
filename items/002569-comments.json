    "body": "Yeah. I've poked at this long enough in my own emacs buffer now to feel positive about the bang-mark. It goes ok in comments too. Though to ensure we don't confuse any shell interpreters trying to run attributes, I think it should differ in first-two chars from shebang itself. I.e. move the bang inside the attribute. So we wind up with:\n\n```\n\n// shebang means 'run through this interpreter', like always\n#!/bin/env rustc --run \n\n// leading sharp-comments in the root source file are scanned for pre-parsing control tags.\n# rust: <compiler-uuid> <low-lang-version> <high-lang-version>\n\n// bang-attrs apply to their containing item.\n// in practice so far these seem to be module-level\n// most of the time, so are \"evocative\" of shebang and\n// pre-parse control tags, without being ambiguous with them\n#[!warn(no_implicit_copies)]\n\n// normal-attrs apply to the following item.\n#[test]\nfn test_patience() { ... }\n\n// bang-comments are docstrings that apply to their enclosing item.\n\n//! this is a one-liner.\n/*! This is a\n *  multi-line one.\n */\n\n// Common triple-slash and double-star doc-comments\n// apply to the next item.\n\n/// Magic number\nconst x = 10;\n\n/** Very enjoyable\n *  function doc\n */\nfn joy() {\n}\n```\n\nIs this too ghastly? It looks ... ok to me. I mean, it's a stretch but we have a bunch of layers of functionality to get to hang together here and it'd be good to have it \"work\" nice.\n\n(In theory we could also wedge-in a pre-parse conditional-compilation mode, via the plain-sharp coments, as an escape hatch for conditionally-compiling things that differ at only a lexeme-by-lexeme level. Sometimes the resolution of the `#[cfg(...)]` attribute is just not fine enough. Might be nice?)\n",

    "body": "The bang does look good. The main reason I didn't want to use it is because in doxygen `/*!` and `/**` mean the same thing, but it is the best looking alternative.\n\nWe should change the attribute grammer to only have one meta item per. This is something I've wanted to do anyway as a  simplification, but I really don't want to be able to write `#[!inner, outer]`. Maybe `#![inner]` is less confusing.\n\nThe bang does strongly suggest logical negation though. What does `#[!cfg(unix)]` mean?\n\nOne thing that might impact attribute syntax is that pcwalton wants to change the extension grammer to be `fmt!` instead of `#fmt`, which I like. This would open more possibilities in the attribute grammer. Specifically, we can get rid of the brackets:\n\n```\n# cfg(unix)\nfn foo() {\n    #! cfg(unix)\n}\n```\n\nOf course then you have to worry about distinguishing between attributes and a shebang.\n",

    "body": "I'm not sure that we need to resort to `#[!`. I'm having a hard time imagining any situation where the token `#![` could begin a legal shebang (so it would always just throw an error), and since the only time this would ever be encountered would be if someone tried to `./their_rust_program`, and since they'd _need_ a valid shebang in that case regardless (and since shebangs can only occur on the first line of a file), I don't know if this could ever be an issue. Worse still, `#[!` would seem to collide with negation within attributes; does `#[!cfg(target_os = \"win32\")]` mean \"don't do this on windows\"?\n\nIff you are swayed by these arguments, I think a clearer rule for the docstrings and attributes would be \"docstrings and attributes apply to the following item, unless their opening token is followed by a `!`\". So you'd have:\n\n```\n#!/bin/env rustc --run\n// for the set of people who like to run their programs directly,\n// and thus will not be at all confused as to what a shebang is\n\n#![module_level_attribute]\n///! module-level one-line doc comment\n/**! module-level\n *   multiline doc comment\n */\n```\n\n(New personal resolution: submit one unrelated-to-syntax patch for every bikeshedding comment I make.)\n",

Once again, I don't think it would be at all hard to disambiguate with shebangs, since people who want to use shebangs will know what a shebang is, and since you can't stick `/` inside a valid rust identifier (and since shebangs must contain absolute rather than relative paths), and since (on bash at least) shebangs can only appear in the very first line of a file, so it's easy to test for.\n\n(patch_debt++)\n",

Having two forms of doc comments has always just seemed silly. :)\n\nInner doc comments can do everything that outer ones can, yeah? At the risk of going out-of-scope, I'd propose getting rid of the bizarre `//!` and `/*!` forms, and converting inner doc comments over to the more-standard `///` and `/**`. Python serves as a precedent here.\n\nMore generally speaking, I feel like having two different syntaxes for doc comments is needlessly decadent. Better to pick just one form and enforce it.\n",

    "body": "I find it interesting that @bstrie suggested using bracket-less versus bracketed as the way to distinguish the two forms.  I want to make a similar suggestion, except that I wanted the bracket-less form with a semi-colon to denote an inner attribute, while a bracketed form without a semi-colon denotes an outer attribute:\n\n`mod m { #inner(attribute); fn foo() { ... } #[outer(attribute)] fn bar() { ... } }`\n\nThis preserves the earlier-mentioned property that the semi-colon indicates that the attribute declaration has meaning all on its own; the human reader need not scan the next entity to understand the intent.  (The backward scanning argument I provided above does not exactly apply here, since the lack of brackets serves to distinguish the two cases for both forward- and backward scanners.  But I still think the semi-colon is a worthwhile terminator to use in this case, in terms of the cognitive hint it supplies.)\n\nI suspect part of the reason that I want to keep the bracketed form for outer-attributes is that it is trivial to compose a series of inner-attributes, since they each independently apply to the enclosing entity.  But for outer-attributes, composition is... well, I suppose it remains pretty trivial, since one can just write them in sequence before the item in question, but I still like the option of putting all the outer-attributes that apply to an entity into one set of `[ ... ]` square brackets.\n",

    "body": "(shrug); I view the two uses of terminating semi-colons have having synergy with each other, not as in conflict.\n- A semicolon-terminated statement: when it finishes running, it really is done, and the only way that it affects the remainder of the program is via whatever side-effects it had.  (This of course has the flip side that those side-effects could actually touch many places.)\n- A semicolon-less final expression: when it finishes running, its value is passed to the caller; one can only understand it via viewing it in tandem with the calling context.\n\nTo me, the situation with semicolon-terminated attributes (semi-global effect) and semicolon-less attributes (local effect on immediately succeeding item) is somewhat analogous.  Arguably it could be a false analogy.\n\nAnyway, I am not going to try very hard to convince you one way or the other, I just wanted to document my viewpoint on the matter.  (Note that I do agree that relying on a semicolon's absence/presence _alone_ as the sole determiner for whether an attribute is inner or outer is too subtle; my point is that I want the semi-colon determiner in addition to whatever other distinguishing syntax we select.)\n",

    "body": "@bstrie I'd presume that any whitespace between the `#` and the identifier would make no difference. The parse just goes \"Found a SHEBANG token; expect an attribute next\".\n\n@pnkfelix I think handling of `;` would make no difference for the Rust side of parsing it. Once it sees a `/` or `\\`, rustc knows it's invalid attribute syntax and can skip it, which would probably catch all valid shebangs. Any problem with `#!` here will stem solely from the fact that the environment might interpret any text file starting with those two bytes specially, irregardless of whether they are followed by a valid file system path or a valid Rust attribute.\n\n---\n\nHowever, if those are reasons enough to not have `#!`, and we pick `#^` as replacement, we could in theory go all the way with it (or at least support the comment form):\n\n```\n//^ parent item\n//> next item\n//< previous item\n/// sugar/exclusive alternative for next item\n\n#^ parent item\n#> next item\n#< previous item\n# sugar/exclusive alternative for next item\n\n/*^ parent item */\n/*> next item */\n/*< previous item */\n/** sugar/exclusive alternative for next item */\n\nmod example {\n    //^ This is an example module \n    //^ Let's see how this looks:\n\n    /// This is a struct\n    struct Bar {\n        field1: uint //< This is the first field\n        field2: uint //< This is the second field\n    }\n\n    mod a; //< stuff\n    mod b; //< more stuff\n    mod c; //< so much more stuff\n}\n\n```\n\n---\n\nTo be clear, this is not a serious proposal, but I think I saw the `//<` doccomment form once or twice in the compiler source. :)\n",

For example:\n# crate: allow(dead_code)\n# crate: type = dylib,rlib\n# doc = \"foo\"\n```\n\n+1! Love it!!
