    "body": "@oblitum With much help from @alexcrichton and a lot of detective work, this is what's going on:\n- Rust currently installs two copies of some of the libraries it uses (\"stage1\" and \"stage2\" artifacts) - they should be identical in any meaningful way (e.g., they export all the same symbols). You can see this as /usr/local/lib/*.dylib (stage1) and /usr/local/lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/*.dylib (stage2).\n- The stage1 libraries are only supposed to be installed because rustc itself depends on them.\n- The stage2 libraries that have dependencies (e.g., librustc, which is used by Racer) are supposed to be linked against other stage2 libraries.\n- When Homebrew does the final installation of rust, it uses install_name_tool to change all the dylib dependencies from relative paths (which make no sense and are just whatever the filesystem happened to look like when rust was built) to absolute paths to /usr/local/Cellar and related locations.\n- Because rust installs two copies of some libraries, homebrew is finding the wrong ones, and making some stage2 libraries dependent on stage1 libraries.\n- When we try to build Racer or other programs that dynamically link against stage2 libraries, the binary is linked against stage2 but the stage2 libs are themselves linking against stage1 due to the Homebrew rewrite thing. This means there are two instances of the rust runtime, resulting in the assertions we're seeing.\n\nThere are three possible fixes:\n- Wait for #14662 to be closed. When the stage1 libs are no longer distributed, Homebrew won't find them and will correctly rewrite the library dependency paths. (This is the real long term fix I think.)\n- Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH like so: `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/lib`.\n- Install Rust using some mechanism other than Homebrew. (This may still require setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, depending on how and where you install it.)\n",
