    "body": "Interesting! This patch itself seems useful in some contexts, but I would want to see it used somewhere in the compiler before committing it. I agree that the failure messages aren't quite up to par with what they should be, and this should likely have the `Session` passed in for usage with the session's `span_fatal` or just `fatal` message (if you don't have a span).\n\nFor now though, the bors queue is quite long, and I want to try to keep it a little smaller than we have been. I would be totally fine accepting this in a the patch which uses this method, but until that time I don't think it's worth it to have a separate pull request for it.\n\nI'm very curious to see how much this helps other portions of the compiler!\n",
