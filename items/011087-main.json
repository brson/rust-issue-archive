  "body": "Before the latest changes at https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10830 I could write `if port.peek() { match port.try_recv() { ...`, now I cannot write equivalent code. One possible solution would be to have a method (let's call it `try_opt`) that returns an enumeration consisting of either a result or an indication of an empty port or a an indication of a closed port. This solution feels kind of ugly to me though so I'd appreciate suggestions on better solutions.\n\ncc: @alexcrichton \n",
