    "body": "Thanks @mund.\n\nThat impl is saying that if a `Box` contains an iterator, then the whole pointer can be treated as an iterator, i.e. just a proxy implementation to allow `Box`s to be thrown around more freely. `Box` already implements `Send` and `Sync` so this case is handled.\n\nThe \"interesting\" ones (for this bug) are when there's a `struct` that's defined purely to be an iterator, e.g. [the `Iter` struct](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcore/slice.rs#L737-L741) in libcore/slice.rs. In particular, that struct contains raw pointers (`*const`'s), and so does not automatically implement `Send` or `Sync`.\n\nHowever, it is threadsafe (with the appropriate bounds on the `T` type) so implementing them manually is correct!\n\nFor that specific type:\n\n``` rust\nunsafe impl<'a, T: Sync> Sync for Iter<'a, T> {}\nunsafe impl<'a, T: Sync> Send for Iter<'a, T> {}\n```\n\nThe appropriate bounds to use depends on the element type that the iterator yields, iterators (for the most part) can be regarded as having the same send/sync-ness as the element type, meaning if the element type of an iterator `Foo<T>` is:\n- `&T`, the appropriate bounds are probably `T: Sync` for both `Sync` and `Send`,\n- `&mut T`, the appropriate bounds are probably `T: Sync` for `Sync` and `T: Send` for `Send`\n- `T`, the appropriate bounds are probably `T: Sync` for `Sync` and `T: Send` for `Send` (same as `&mut T`)\n\nIn summary, it is likely only the iterator structs/enums that contain raw pointers that need to be considered for this bug.\n",

    "body": "Yeah you're correct that the Unix iterators are fine to be Send/Sync, they only currently opt-out because the Windows ones are not Send/Sync (due to their storage of raw pointers). I haven't done the necessary leg work to ensure that the Windows implementations are indeed safe to send across threads, so I figured I'd just make the Unix ones not Send/Sync (e.g. the more conservative choice).\n\nI'd probably avoid adding Send/Sync to those iterators for now as needing an iterator to be Send/Sync is quite rare, and even rarer for the two iterators in question. Plus, it's always possible to make these Send/Sync backwards compatibly!\n",
