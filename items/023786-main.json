  "body": "This commit removes parser support for `extern crate \"foo\" as bar` as the\nrenamed crate is now required to be an identifier. Additionally this commit\nenables hard errors on crate names that contain hyphens in them, they must now\nsolely contain alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n\nIf the crate name is inferred from the file name, however, the file name\n`foo-bar.rs` will have the crate name inferred as `foo_bar`. If a binary is\nbeing emitted it will have the name `foo-bar` and a library will have the name\n`libfoo_bar.rlib`.\n\nThis commit is a breaking change for a number of reasons:\n- Old syntax is being removed. This was previously only issuing warnings.\n- The output for the compiler when input is received on stdin is now `rust_out`\n  instead of `rust-out`.\n- The crate name for a crate in the file `foo-bar.rs` is now `foo_bar` which can\n  affect infrastructure such as logging.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nCloses #23533\n",
