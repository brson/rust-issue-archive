    "body": "This looks like it is still very much a work in progress, the sections start tapering out towards the end and there's a bunch of FIXME links and notes throughout the document. This isn't linked anywhere from the rest of the documentation, but I'm worried about adding a half-finished document which may just fall out of date. \n\nAre we hoping to add this to the repo and continue iterating on it from inside the repo? I'm pretty ok with it because it's not linked from anywhere, I just worry a bit about its future.\n",
