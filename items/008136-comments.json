    "body": "I got halfway through trying to implement this with a simple cons-style list before I realized I was still one requirement short. The requirements are:\n- O(1) append a single tombstone\n- O(1) append a list of many tombstones\n- Neither destruction nor consumption of arbitrarily many should stack overflow\n\nThe current approach, using closures, fails to requirement 3, but a simple cons-cell list fails to requirement 2. The reason for requirements 1 and 2 is that appending new tombstones is done while holding a pthread mutex.\n\nI think `DList` is the only data structure we have that supports this, but it has been moved to libextra.\n",
