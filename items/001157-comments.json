Maybe graydon has an opinion.\n\nAs to the last question, we don't need to verify the hash. This hash is just a hash of the exported metadata (everything in the #[link] attribute), and used to help differentiate the filename from other builds of the same library. I don't think we're using it for any security properties.\n\nI'm a bit worried about how this will impact the build system since we won't be able to know the names of the libraries we're producing.\n",
