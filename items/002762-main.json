  "body": "Work for issue #2498.\n\nNotes:\n1. This did not rebase cleanly against incoming, but I submitted it anyway as requested.\n2. I have changed the test suite to use `//~ ERROR` instead of `//! ERROR` to work around a conflict with the sugared doc syntax.\n3. There is a new script: `etc/sugarise-doc-comments.py` to convert unsugared doc attributes, but I have not actually committed the results of running this script. I did not want the pull request to become too large and prone to merge conflicts (although I had to update the test suite in order to `make check`). It handles 95% of cases but will require some manual editing to deal with (mostly) lines that become too long.\n4. I plan on updating https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-using-rustdoc once this pull request has been accepted.\n",
