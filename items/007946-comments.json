    "body": "The best thing to do here would be to look at what other Unicode-aware languages do, and then do that. This is purely for CYA, because I can contrive security risks regardless of which behavior we pick (thanks to idiosyncracies in editors, which we can never control).\n\n(I'm not using the actual Unicode code points in these code examples, for purposes of visual illustration.)\n\nHere's the risk in our current behavior. Imagine an editor that starts newlines on `\\r`.\n\n``` rust\n// imagine that this comment ends in a \\r\nif user.is_not_the_president { return; }\n// the above line is commented out!\nlaunch_all_nuclear_missiles();\n```\n\nNow imagine that we adopt the plan where line comments end on any Unicode newline-equivalent. Per sp3d's Wikipedia link:\n\n> Recognizing and using the newline codes greater than 0x7F is not often done. They are multiple bytes in UTF-8 and the code for NEL has been used as the ellipsis ('\u2026') character in Windows-1252.\n\nSo we merely need to imagine an editor on Windows that doesn't recognize one of the less common newline characters, which to a user might look something like:\n\n``` rust\n// whatever you do, DO NOT do anything like\u2026 send_user_data_to_hackers();\n// the \u2026 in the above line ends the comment, leaving working code!\n```\n\nThough realistically the \"\u2026\" would probably be rendered as a \"\u25af\" (or other \"unknown character\" symbol), but that doesn't much change the risk here, which is caused by potential disregard for Unicode and incorrect syntax highlighting.\n",

However, GHC 7.6.3 on Linux does not appear to consider \"vertab\" (0x0b), \"formfeed\" (0x0c), nor \"return\" (0x0d) to constitute a newline, but merely whitespace; it considers \"return formfeed\" (0x0d 0x0a) to be whitespace followed by a newline.\n\nJava:\n\"Except for comments (\u00a73.7), identifiers, and the contents of character and string literals (\u00a73.10.4, \u00a73.10.5), all input elements (\u00a73.5) in a program are formed only from ASCII characters (or Unicode escapes (\u00a73.3) which result in ASCII characters).\"\n...\n\"Lines are terminated by the ASCII characters CR, or LF, or CR LF.

Other new line or line breaking characters are treated as white space but not as line terminators. The character sequence <CR><LF> is commonly used as a line terminator. It should be considered a single character for the purpose of reporting line numbers.\" - http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-7.3\n\nPython 3:\n\"A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line sequence. In source files, any of the standard platform line termination sequences can be used - the Unix form using ASCII LF (linefeed), the Windows form using the ASCII sequence CR LF (return followed by linefeed), or the old Macintosh form using the ASCII CR (return) character. All of these forms can be used equally, regardless of platform.\" - http://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#physical-lines\n\nAll these languages (excluding the ghc implementation of Haskell) accept at least \\r, \\n, and \\r\\n. \nSome additionally choose to support LS (U+2028) and PS (U+2029), the former two and NL (U+2085), or VT (0x0b) and FF (0x0c).\n\nAre there other languages worth looking at?\n",

The set of physical source file characters accepted is implementation-defined.\" - http://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3690.pdf (\u00a7 2.2, page 31)\nThis, to me, seems to indicate that C++ implementations can do whatever they consider sane for processing newline sequences.\n\nGo:\n\"newline        = /\\* the Unicode code point U+000A */ .\"\n...\n\"White space, formed from spaces (U+0020), horizontal tabs (U+0009), carriage returns (U+000D), and newlines (U+000A), is ignored except as it separates tokens that would otherwise combine into a single token.\" - http://golang.org/ref/spec#Lexical_elements\nIt looks like Go doesn't consider any high-unicode characters, vertical tabs, form-feeds, etc. to be whitespace or newlines--only 0x0a counts as a newline.\n\nRuby:\n\"line-terminator ::\n    0x0d? 0x0a\" - http://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000011432.pdf (\u00a7 8.3, page 40)\n\"whitespace ::\n    0x09 | 0x0b | 0x0c | 0x0d | 0x20 | line-terminator-escape-sequence\" - http://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000011432.pdf (\u00a7 8.3, page 41)\n\"source-character ::\n    [ any character in ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV ]\" (\u00a7 8.2, page 39)\nSo Ruby is specified to be a 7-bit encoding (essentially ASCII), but states that \"The support for any other character sets and encodings is unspecified.\". As far as I could tell the standard implementation does nothing beyond the spec w/r/t newline handling, but the code was fairly hard to read.\n\nBetween the latter two, the convention seems to be to consider 0x0d characters as whitespace and 0x0a newlines, such that \\n and \\r\\n newlines work, somewhat similarly to the current Rust behavior--Ruby will consider \"0x0d 0x0a\" a single token without external whitespace while Go will not, as I understand it.\n",

    "body": "We came across this issue recently and were planning on reporting it when we found that you have been long aware. \r\n\r\nWe originally uncovered a similar problem in the Solidity language during our [Solidity compiler audit](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/solidity-compiler-audit-8cfc0316a420/). While this is arguably more severe in a blockchain setting where auditability substitutes trust, we believe that improper handling of `\\r` characters is a very dangerous trait of any language. In the case of Rust, the fact that `\\r` is [outright banned](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/760226733e940cb375f791e894fbb554555eeb01/src/libsyntax/parse/lexer/mod.rs#L182) in doc comments but [silently ignored](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/760226733e940cb375f791e894fbb554555eeb01/src/libsyntax/parse/lexer/mod.rs#L184) in line comments, makes matters even more confusing. \r\n\r\nWe'd love it if you would consider reopening this issue for further discussion :) ",
