    "body": "This has been discussed numerous times across various RFCs and internals threads over the last ~7 years (and probably before then, too), and the latest 'next step' towards stabilization here seems to be the custom test frameworks RFC (tracked in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50297). That RFC and implementation seem unlikely to be pushed over the finish line -- even for a working, usable nightly implementation -- on any relatively short timescale, so I would like to suggest that we discuss whether the existing bench API could be minimally stabilized essentially as-is (listed in the issue description).\r\n\r\nIt has a number of extensions that users have asked for historically, some already implemented:\r\n\r\n* Non-time data collection (e.g., memory, throughput -- in bytes/time instead of time/op)\r\n* Customizable data reporting, aggregation, etc.\r\n* Customizable number of iterations\r\n* Customizable \"parameter\" to vary (e.g., to evaluate scalability of some algorithm)\r\n\r\nThe majority of these seem relatively feasible to either add to libtest or develop out of tree (e.g., in crates like [criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html)), but also look to me like extensible design atop the very simple interface we have today which has -- largely -- worked fine for the majority of basic use cases. A relatively fast skim through of the various RFCs to me suggest that the *main* objection to just stabilizing in place has always been more general designs or concerns about a forever stable piece of the language. Ultimately, it seems to me that a few functions and an attribute (which could have a different meaning or multiple meanings in the future) are not *that* painful to commit to.\r\n\r\nFor example, we could, I think, easily imagine that `#[bench]` here is basically the equivalent of `#[ignore]`. The main difference is the argument passed to the function, but it seems like the minimal API being stabilized here could be provided by other frameworks, or at least doesn't really hurt them. The surface area is pretty minimal, after all.\r\n\r\nThe stabilization would mean stable access to the test crate, which I believe today is entirely unstable, so one alternative would be to move Bencher to std::test, re-exporting it in test.",

    "body": "black_box is separately tracked by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64102 these days and is not necessary for a baseline stabilization (the closure return value is already passed through a black box, IIRC).\r\n\r\nFWIW, I don't personally see bench as *distinct* from test there -- they both share nearly all of the same infrastructure in the compiler and libtest. If we wanted to make test the only special attribute and require `#[test] #[bench]` or `#[test(bench)]` or something on all benchmarks in the stable variant, that would probably be fine (just seems like needless churn to me).",

    "body": "Given that [the custom test frameworks experiment has been closed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50297#issuecomment-1111298994), how does @rust-lang/lang and @rust-lang/libs-api feel about either:\r\n\r\n* Stabilize the `#[bench]` attribute and a minimal `Bencher` API as-is (perhaps in a different module than `test::bench`?)\r\n* Or deprecate built-in benchmarking entirely.\r\n  * `cargo bench` would continue to run `benches/*.rs` to support external tools like [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs).\r\n  * Possible `Cargo.toml` changes for a future edition: make `harness = false` the default in `[[benches]]` sections, make `bench = false` the default in other \"target\" sections (`[lib]`, `[[bin]]`, `[[example]]`, and `[[test]]`).",
