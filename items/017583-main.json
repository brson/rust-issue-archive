  "body": "This begins the work towards a new TLS implementation. It will be useful\nto have the initial work in-tree for test coverage across various\nplatforms and to allow for collaborative work on the API. The current\nfast implementation using `#[thread_local]` is expected to work on\nLinux, Windows (with #17563), OS X, FreeBSD and the current Android\nversion (but not the bot).\n\nComing up with a good API will need to wait until there's a full\nimplementation with destructor support (#17572) and a fallback path\n(#17579) for platforms like iOS and old versions of Android. A set of 6\nmacros is probably not the ideal API... but it's an obvious way of\ncovering all of the use cases with minimal overhead.\n\nCloses #17569\n",
