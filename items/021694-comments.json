    "body": "I did a bunch more profiling. First off, normalisation and projection barely showed up in the profile, so I think #20304 is a red herring.\n\nSubsts interning did, but because it was called a _huge_ number of times, it's not that expensive for each call. I tried disabling interning, for rustdoc this led to OOMs. For libcore which also has a very high type checking time (relative to other phases) this only reduced type checking time by 6%, so I predict it won't be helpful in the rustdoc case.\n\nThe majority of the time is coming from trait selection - `SelectionContext::evalute_predicate_recursively` is the overarching method in the profile. Winnowing in particular is taking ~75% of the time.\n\nSo, I don't think caching normalisation and projection is worthwhile, at least here, it might be for other reasons. I need to look a bit closer at the code around selections. AIUI, only first phase is cached and I don't think winnowing is. I wonder if we could cache that too? I also want to check that caching is working as expected and we're not missing where we should hit.\n",
