    "body": "Should `Path(\"/\")` be considered empty, on unix? How about `Path(\"C:\\\\\")` on windows? I'm asking because, to some extent, \"empty\" is a concept that doesn't really apply to paths-as-a-whole. Paths have components (which there might be zero of) plus possibly a root, of various forms.\n\nThe structure holding Path is meant to be inspected directly if you like, so `p.components.len() == 0` might tell you what you're interested in. Is that what you want to test though? Or only if it would literally evaluate to the empty string?\n",

    "body": "I'd say the use case is the conversion of a string to a Path where the path is supposed to point to something that may or may not exist. These will often come from a config file or command line so there is a desire to do some preflighting or asserts to make sure that the path is sane. Perhaps the thing to do is provide some sort if is_well_formed method that checks for one or more components plus no bad characters for the current file system (WIndows, at least, has a lot of these).\n\nRegardless I would like a more visible abstraction than checking that components is non-empty. Or alternatively just fail if from_str is called with something not well formed.\n",
