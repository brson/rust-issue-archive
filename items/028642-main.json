  "body": "This PR removes random remaining `Ident`s outside of libsyntax and performs general cleanup\nIn particular, interfaces of `Name` and `Ident` are tidied up, `Name`s and `Ident`s being small `Copy` aggregates are always passed to functions by value, and `Ident`s are never used as keys in maps, because `Ident` comparisons are tricky.\n\nAlthough this PR closes https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/6993 there's still work related to it:\n- `Name` can be made `NonZero` to compress numerous `Option<Name>`s and `Option<Ident>`s but it requires const unsafe functions.\n- Implementation of `PartialEq` on `Ident` should be eliminated and replaced with explicit hygienic, non-hygienic or member-wise comparisons.\n- Finally, large parts of AST can potentially be converted to `Name`s in the same way as HIR to clearly separate identifiers used in hygienic and non-hygienic contexts.\n\nr? @nrc \n",
