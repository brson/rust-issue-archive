    "body": "I am sympathetic to the idea that struct fields should drop in reverse order, but it's harder to justify dropping tuples in reverse order, and I cannot justify dropping fixed-length array elements in reverse order. Given that structs, tuples, and (assuming all fields are the same type) fixed-length arrays are basically isomorphic to each other, they should all drop values in the same order, and since I can't justify reversing the order for arrays, that indicates that structs should drop in declaration order.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to say that variable bindings vs value fields are different things. Value fields are just components of a value, and values always drop components in declaration order. On the other hand, variables are independent declarations with independent lifetimes, and the nesting of these lifetimes requires LIFO drop order. To put it another way, a scope is a stack of values, so the stack drops in reverse order as it pops, but each independent value is not a stack, and so there is no reverse ordering.\n",
