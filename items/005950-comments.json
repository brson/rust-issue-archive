I think this is actually working as intended: the 'pub' on the item being re-exported is itself the indication of whether it can be seen from outside.\n\nCuriously, you can't use it locally (with no `pub` anywhere in the file) either. This feels not entirely well defined? Or else I'm not well informed enough to address it. Leaving open until we have Patrick around for subsequent triage.\n",
