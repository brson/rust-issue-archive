Convert\n\n```\nenum Foo { A(..), B(.., Noncopyable) }\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nstruct Foo { v: Foo1, _nc: Noncopyable }\nenum Foo1 { A(..), B(..) }\n``\n\nand then match on `x.v` instead of `x`.\n\nI think it's not so common though to use enums as the \"top-level\" type\nfor unsafe things like `Rc` etc.\n```\n",
