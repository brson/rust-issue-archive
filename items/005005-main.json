  "body": "These commits take the old bitv implementation and modernize it with an explicit self, some minor touchups, and using what I think is some more recent patterns (like `::new` instead of `Type()`).\n\nAdditionally, this adds an implementation of `container::Set` on top of a bit vector to have as a set of `uint`s. I initially tried to parameterize the type for the set to be `T: NumCast` but I was hitting build problems in stage0 which I think means that it's not in a snapshot yet, so it's just hardcoded as a set of `uint`s now. In the future perhaps it could be parameterized. I'm not sure if it would really add anything, though, so maybe it's nicer to be hardcoded anyway.\n\nI also added some extra methods to do normal bit vector operations on the set in-place, but these aren't a part of the `Set` trait right now. I haven't benchmarked any of these operations just yet, but I imagine that there's quite a lot of room for optimization here and there.\n",
