    "body": "But RangeTo doesn't represent a range that starts from zero, it's a range that has no lower bound, and therefore cannot be iterated in a forward direction.\n\nOne possibility is to extract the method \"next_back\" from \"DoubleEndedIterator\" into a separate trait: \"ReverseIterator\" or \"BackIterator\", and \"DoubleEndedIterator\" is then equivalent to \"Iterator + BackIterator\".\n\nNow, \"Range\" can implement \"DoubleEndedIterator\", \"RangeFrom\" can implement \"Iterator\", and \"RangeTo\" can implement \"BackIterator\". Finally, the \"Rev\" function is extended to work on all iterators, such that Rev(Iterator) => BackIterator, Rev(BackIterator) => Iterator, and Rev(DoubleEndedIterator) => DoubleEndedIterator.\n\nThis would allow iteration of RangeTo but only in the reverse direction.\n",

    "body": "I would like to re-open the discussion on splitting the current `DoubleEndedIterator` trait into two separate traits: one for forward iteration (`Iterator`) and one for reverse iteration (`ReverseIterator`).\n\nThe discussion above aimed to allow types like `RangeTo` and `RangeToInclusive` to implement reverse iteration. This change would enable us to write expressions like:\n\n```rust\n(..=n).rev()\n```\n\nand it intuitively represents an *infinite descending iterator* starting from `n`, rather than the finite one.\n\nCurrently, to achieve an infinite reverse iterator (i.e., a descending sequence starting from `n`), we have to resort to workarounds such as:\n\nhttps://users.rust-lang.org/t/rev-method-on-rangeto/74101/2 (by Frank Steffahn)\n```rust\nstd::iter::repeat_with({\n    let mut i = n;\n    move || (i, i -= 1).0\n})\n```\n\nAlternative approaches like:\n\n- `(0..).map(|i| n - i)`  \n  *\u2013 may suffer from overflow issues.*\n\n- `std::iter::successors(Some(n), |&n| Some(n - 1))`  \n  *\u2013 does not properly advertise its infinite nature through its `size_hint` and `TrustedLen` implementation.*\n\nFor context, consider the implementation of `RangeFrom`:\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ce36a966c79e109dabeef7a47fe68e5294c6d71e/library/core/src/iter/range.rs#L1010-L1035\n\nThis implementation correctly signals the iterator's infinite nature.",
