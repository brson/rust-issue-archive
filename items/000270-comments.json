    "body": "Here's a code example that reproduces it:\n\n```\nuse std;\nimport std::uint;\n\nfn foo() {\n  for each (uint i in uint::range(0u, 10u)) { \n    if (i > 5u) {\n      ret;\n    }\n  }\n  fail \"Shouldn't have reached this point\";\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  foo();\n  log_err \"Okay!\";\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is that the ret inside the for-each loop is returning from the closure that trans generates automatically for the loop body, not from foo. That's why it acts like a continue.\n\nI was going to try fixing this, but it's not obvious to me how to (there's no other case when you're returning from more than one nested scope at once), so I'm changing it back to unassigned.\n",
