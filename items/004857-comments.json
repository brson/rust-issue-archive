    "body": "OK, if that's the offending commit, I feel pretty comfortable with letting #4848 fix it.  I wrote 0682ad0 assuming that the analysis of what types should be moved by default was correct, but there turned out be a big bug in that code which #4848 fixes,so I'm not surprised that 0682ad0 would introduce a lot of copies as a result.  I'm not sure why the old code didn't, but it was broken in various ways (not that the new code isn't...just hopefully fewer), some of which may have caused it to actually do the right thing by accident. :)\n",
