  "body": "This PR begins the process of [runtime removal](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230) by dismantling the `librustuv` crate and associated event loop.\n\nThe result is that, while `libgreen` can still be used for task scheduling purposes, it will no longer be feasible to use green-threaded I/O.\n\nRemoving the libuv-based event loop eases the transition away from the runtime system, which will be done incrementally.\n\nIn terms of visible API changes, this PR:\n- Removes `std::io::signal`, which was never implemented on the native threading model.\n- Removes the `iotest!` macro, which was previously used to run I/O tests on both green and native threading models.\n- Removes the `green_start!` macro for starting an application with a `librustuv` event loop.\n- Removes the `librustuv` crate itself.\n\nIt also removes the `libuv` and `gyp` submodules and adjusts the build system and copyright notices accordingly.\n\nIf you wish to continue using `librustuv` and green-threaded I/O, consider using [green-rs](https://github.com/alexcrichton/green-rs/), which provides its own I/O stack.\n",
