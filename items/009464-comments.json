    "body": "Thanks for the fix! If you wouldn't mind, it'd be nice to have these things done as well:\n- This should have a test in the `src/test/run-pass` test suite to ensure that this never breaks again\n- Could you rebase all your commits into just one?\n- Could you expand the message in the commit itself? Github recognizes the magical string `Closes #XXXX`, I'm not sure if it will recognize the URL. A short description of what you fixed and how you fixed it in the commit message would also be nice.\n\nThanks again for fixing this!\n",
