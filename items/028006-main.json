  "body": "This imports the [aster](https://github.com/serde-rs/aster) library into the Rust repository as an unstable library. Aster is a `syntax::ast` builder, that simplifies the generation of rust AST.  It abstracts away many of the default options, and shields the user from fields being added, removed, or restructured in many circumstances. This allows a library like [Serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) to be much more reliably compiled on nightly, which has not been broken by aster in the past couple months.\n\nThis is specifically being done for the Servo project, which has started to use Serde and has gotten broken a few times because of the lag between libsyntax changes and the requisite changes needed to be made in Aster.\n\nI realize that while this is an unstable library this still might need to go through the RFC process, so please let me know and I'll write one up.\n\ncc @nrc, @pcwalton, @SimonSapin, @Manishearth \n",
