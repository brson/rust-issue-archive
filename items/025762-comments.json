    "body": "Amazing! I'm really looking forward to turning back on these kinds of tests. A few questions:\n- I forget if we're actually running these by default, but these look like they'll be solid enough to enable by default, so just to confirm, these are run on `make check`, right?\n- What's up with the `-C no-prepopulate-passes` argument to each test? Should that be an argument specified by compiletest or are there tests that may not wish to pass that?\n- Do you know how brittle these tests would be across LLVM versions? In theory we have support for a number of LLVM version ranges, but we may want to disable the tests entirely on earlier LLVM versions if it causes problems. Also, do you know if it'd be difficult to update these tests with an LLVM upgrade?\n",

    "body": "It would probably be a good idea to let different tests decide whether or not they want to pass `-C no-prepopulate-passes`. I can see a test that wants to make sure something about an `always_inline` function and thus doesn't want it to disappear from the IR. On the other side, we might want to test that always inline is indeed always inline.\n\nAs for brittleness, that really depends on how specific the tests get. For the initial couple in this pull we're only checking things like argument attributes (`noalias`, `nocapture` etc) and I don't expect those to change all that much. In any case, in the event they did change, we'd have to upgrade `librustc` anyways to emit the right flags, changing some tests wouldn't be all that bad. \n",
