    "body": "More thinking-aloud: since the problem is in FastISel, which can be turned off, the problem can be worked around at rust side with no need to touch the LLVM currently in use.\n\nBy passing some extra options (`rustc -C llvm-args=-fast-isel=0`), the generated code looks much better and the output becomes `OK :)` as expected. (At the cost of somewhat slower compilation, but I think that's a price worth to pay for correctness.)\n\n```\n00000000000071ec <_ZN4main20h74a595d6a5b2fbb6faaE>:\n    71ec:       a9be6ffc        stp     x28, x27, [sp,#-32]!\n    71f0:       a9017bfd        stp     x29, x30, [sp,#16]\n    71f4:       910043fd        add     x29, sp, #0x10\n    71f8:       d104c3ff        sub     sp, sp, #0x130\n    71fc:       321a0fe8        orr     w8, wzr, #0x3c0\n    7200:       2a0803e9        mov     w9, w8\n    7204:       f81e83a9        str     x9, [x29,#-24]\n    7208:       94000047        bl      7324 <_ZN3num7i32.Int9min_value20hb9150aaae7f1b75agpbE>\n    720c:       b81e43a0        str     w0, [x29,#-28]\n    7210:       b89e43a9        ldrsw   x9, [x29,#-28]\n    7214:       f85e83aa        ldr     x10, [x29,#-24]\n    7218:       eb0a0129        subs    x9, x9, x10\n```\n",
