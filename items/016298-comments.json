    "body": "@mneumann sure!\n\nFrom a high level, compilation of these platforms works not through bootstrapping but rather cross-compiling. The [linux-cross container](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-buildbot/tree/master/slaves/linux-cross) contains all the bits and pieces for this, and we use the new rustbuild build system to cross-compile via `./configure --host=new-platform`. Those then make their ways to nightlies which enable Cargo builds and rustup builds (also using the same linux-cross container). Eventually we've got a full rust compiler package, and that can itself then later be used for a native bootstrap!\n\nThe [linux-cross Dockerfile](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-buildbot/blob/master/slaves/linux-cross/Dockerfile) is a little sprawling, but it's basically just got a section for each platform it can cross-compile to. For example FreeBSD/NetBSD [happen here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-buildbot/blob/c9de974b41d4af6cf845f01b1887d20e0eba43eb/slaves/linux-cross/Dockerfile#L119-L123), with the real meat being their [corresponding scripts](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-buildbot/blob/master/slaves/linux-cross/build_freebsd_toolchain.sh). I suspect that a DragonFly script would look pretty similar, right?\n\nTo get it work, the steps would look like:\n1. Configure the linux-cross container for cross-compilation to DragonFly, checking in scripts and such.\n2. Boot up the container and configure it to build a cross-compiler. You can copy a ./configure line similar to the other cross compiled hosts we have:\n   \n   ```\n   ../configure --disable-valgrind --enable-optimize --enable-optimize-tests --disable-debug --enable-debug-assertions --enable-rustbuild --musl-root=/musl-i686 --build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --host=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu,arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf\n   ```\n3. Run `make` and fix bugs until cross-compilation works and `make dist` produces a bunch of tarballs.\n4. Send a PR to rust-lang/rust with any bug fixes\n5. Send a PR to rust-lang/rust-buildbot with updates\n\nFrom there I can take over deployment and adding an auto builder, should be pretty straightforward! Once that's all up an running it's a pretty similar set of steps to get Cargo/rustup building as well. The tricky part with these two is OpenSSL, but it may not be that hard in the long run. We can cross that bridge when we get there :)\n",
