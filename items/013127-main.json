  "body": "Reader.read_at_least() ensures that at least a given number of bytes\nhave been read. The most common use-case for this is ensuring at least 1\nbyte has been read. If the reader returns 0 enough times in a row, a new\nerror kind NoProgress will be returned instead of looping infinitely.\n\nThis change is necessary in order to properly support Readers that\nrepeatedly return 0, either because they're broken, or because they're\nattempting to do a non-blocking read on some resource that never becomes\navailable.\n\nAlso add .push() and .push_at_least() methods. push() is like read() but\nthe results are appended to the passed Vec.\n\nRemove Reader.fill() and Reader.push_exact() as they end up being thin\nwrappers around read_at_least() and push_at_least().\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
