I suppose we could make the code simpler by always buffering one element, but that\u2019s consuming the underlying iterator more than we have to. I don\u2019t know which is better.\n\nAs to `peek(n)`, yes that could be useful as well but as you say not as obvious to implement. (I also personally don\u2019t need it yet.)\n",
