For slices, we also omit a second write call, but this time it's 8 extra bytes we're not hashing.\n",

Here's `Hash128to64`, paraphrased:\n\n``` c\n  uint64_t a = (hash_result ^ seed) * kMul;\n  a ^= (a >> 47);\n  uint64_t b = (seed ^ a) * kMul;\n  b ^= (b >> 47);\n  b *= kMul;\n  return b;\n```\n\nSource: https://github.com/google/farmhash/blob/master/src/farmhash.h#L129-L138\n\nThe hasher can hold a buffer of hash results. FarmHash could be used to hash this buffer's contents once buffer is full, and in `fn finish`.\n",

As you can see, without the elision of delimiters, the slice hashing is just the same as before. We could even choose to not elide any delimiters for Siphash at all.\n\nThis PR is just experimental, I'd want to do something like gankro's hash_one_shot idea, but I can't find a way to do it that doesn't also change Hash / Hasher backwards incompatibly.\n\nThe main thing I'm worried is that someone will point out how chunking-dependent hashing might totally break hashing of some types (I can imagine a rope behaving that way). Should that stop this proposal, even if this proposal doesn't introduces that, it only _caters_ to a farmhash impl that could do so?\n",

    "body": "I was mostly worried about a custom hash implementation of of something like `struct Foo(usize)` where the hash algorithm was `hasher.delimit(self.0)`, in that case all instances would hash to the same thing, right? (at least with siphash).\n\nSome opinions I have in this area are:\n- I'm not sure it's necessarily very desirable to have `[u8]` and `str` hash the same way, it's easy to accidentally rely on this sometimes perhaps.\n- Hashing in one shot is possible today with a custom hasher, it's just not generally applicable to all types and cases (even using the same API we have right now).\n- The `Hasher` trait doesn't currently have many strong guarantees about it, for example if you have a block of data and feed it via two writes, there's no documented guarantee that no matter where you split the block you'll get the same hash result. This may be a nice guarantee to have, however.\n\nI personally prefer to do design like this either externally or on issues, but I know others feel differently :)\n",
