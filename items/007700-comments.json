On the other hand, it was unclear whether `*const` could or should be removed just yet.\n\n`&const` is coercible from `&mut` and `&` so I think that the purpose was to define a method on `&const` and you get an implementation regardless of whether you have a `&` or `&mut` pointer. Nowadays, `&mut` is coercible to `&` so this is no longer an issue.\n\nAs far as I know, `*mut` is not coercible to `*` and I'm not sure that it's being planned to be or whether it should be.\n",

    "body": "I found one situation where it was nice to have `&const`. I had some code that used to use:\n\n```\nvec::bytes::copy_memory(dst: &mut [u8], src: &const [u8], count: uint)\n```\n\nto blit bytes inside the same vector. This was safe because `copy_memory` uses `memmove`, which guarantees it works on overlapping arrays. After b29c36867418ea551b23c767f45454eea4623d79, the `src` was changed to be `&[u8]`. This made me change from this code snippet:\n\n```\nlet mut data = vec::from_elem(1024, 0u8);\n...\nvec::bytes::copy_memory(data, data.const_slice(512, 1024), 512);\n```\n\nTo\n\n```\nlet mut data = vec::from_elem(1024, 0u8);\n...\nlet mut i = 0;\nwhile i < 512 {\n    data[i] = data[512 + i];\n    i += 1;\n}\n```\n\nBecause passing an immutable reference and a mutable reference to the same data to a function is rightly an error.\n",
