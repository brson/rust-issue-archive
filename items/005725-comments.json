    "body": "Yes, sorry! That was brief. Let me expand. First off, I apologize, when I first read your patch I was somewhat mislead because you used the letters `mt` to refer to the mutability, but `mt` is usually the pair of a mutability and a type.  Including an `mt` in `ty_trait` wouldn't make much sense. It would probably be better to just use `m` or `mutbl` if the value is just a mutability.\n\nAnyhow, adding a mutability to ty_trait doesn't strike me as ideal, since it doesn't apply e.g. to `~Trait`, but it's also not a bad thing.  We have other cases in our type representation that are \"more general\" than they need to be.  I tend to think we should refactor those, and perhaps we can eventually update this along the lines of #5762, but in the meantime its ok.  \n\nI haven't had time to read over the patch in great detail to tell if you're covering all the necessary checks yet though, but it's a good idea to get the basic syntax etc in place.\n",
