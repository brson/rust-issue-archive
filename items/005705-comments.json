Check the --local-rust and --local-rust-root parameters for ./configure.\nAlso, I'm against bundling binaries in source tarballs. They are target-dependent and bundling all of them will make the released archive quite large.\n\nDownloading an external bootstrapper is a minor issue for downstream packagers too, though.
