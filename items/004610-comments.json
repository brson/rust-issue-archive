    "body": "First thoughts: \\o/ \\o/ I totally want this to land.\n\nSubsequent thoughts focus on the remainder of the conversation we were having over in the gist, when tav was asking for ever-fewer moving parts (from the user's side), and I sympathize with that. I like where you've gone with this but I think there might still be a few opportunities to file down extra stuff users _have_ to do in the default case, without sacrificing the things you, me, pcwalton and others (rightly) want to keep possible in more-special cases.\n\nIn particular, the two remaining \"extra bits\" I think we can remove by default are the `id` name being different from a URL name, and `package.rs` separate from a crate-root source file (by default). I'm sorry to be a broken record about it but hear me out a moment; these are subtle but the payoff for \"letting the user do the least work\" is I think quite important:\n- Concerning URLs: It's the case now and I think for the foreseeable future that a DNS-associated name-prefix controlled by a user is a feature of the development landscape. Every user is likely to have a `host.com/user` prefix, and given this it seems fine to make `host.com/user/pkg` the naming scheme for packages as in Go. I particularly like that -- without a protocol -- it maps equally well to a filesystem path and a public URL. As tav pointed out, this means you can develop your packages locally in directories called `github.com/z0w0/foo` so long as that's put in your rustpkg path, then write `extern mod foo = \"github.com/z0w0/foo\";` in neighbouring packages that use it and have them work both locally and against the internet when other people download them. It requires the tool to have a map of URL prefixes and inferred protocol access methods, but I think that is likely to work well in reality. It seems to for Go and on this count I think they really did the right thing (it was what I wanted to do at first too, I just hadn't worked out as many details as they did)\n- Concerning `package.rs`: it's definitely the case that if you have _custom_ build logic you're going to want that to be in a different file than the entire crate, since you want to build it and run it to perform the build tasks (very slick idea with `rustpkg do <cmd>` btw. I wouldn't have thought of that). But when you _don't_ have custom build logic, the only reasons for requiring an additional `package.rs` separate from the crate root that I can see are:\n  - To make it easier to find; for this I think the convention that \"the shallowest `*.rs` file in the repo is the crate root\" is likely to work fine, or maybe \"the shallowest `mod.rs` file\". We already have the problem of having to name the source file associated with a directory module.\n  - To handle multiple crates in the same package. A valid concern! But also one I think that can be handled declaratively if we make one minor assumption: that a package provides _one or more_ crates and that the root crate is the one you \"get\" if you try to link-against the crate by its URL-name. Other crates may come along for the ride as extra installs (either local versioned-together dependencies, build-dependencies, binaries or the like) but they aren't `extern mod`-able by URL-name. The extras could be indicated declaratively still by either scanning the crate for direct dependencies (`extern mod other = \"other/mod.rs\";`) or by looking for attributes in the crate root indicating auxiliary installation artifacts: `#[pkg_aux(\"other_cmd/mod.rs\")]`\n- One final caveat concerning `package.rs` as a filename is that given the `pkg` abbreviation on attributes and on the tool name, possibly `pkg.rs` is a more symmetric name.\n\nAll these are, as I say, just minor concerns. I only raise them at this point in order to try to nudge things that may be harder to nudge the further down the road we get. This is definitely the road I want to be going down though, in general. It's great code and I'm glad to see it; did a quick read through all the files and would be happy to see this landing.\n",

    "body": "@graydon your points are really good, but I haven't done it exactly the way you suggest for a few reasons. I'm completely open to having the URL be the unique ID. But I am really not happy at all with having it find crates to be used/installed just by walking down the directory. That really doesn't sound right to me. I like a central metadata format, because it allows us to have a central place to store data that might be needed in the future. I also think the central metadata declaring where the files is a better way to do it because there's no ambiguity to the logic of finding the files - whereas walking the directory is weak to things like localized filesystem sorting methods, if I'm not mistaken. Plus, if there's any external things that need to detect a package - for example, Travis CI - it is much easier for them to be _sure_ that there will always be a `pkg.rs` file.\n\nI'm 100% dedicated to this, so if there's a solid concept to tweak towards, then I'm commited to changing it :). But I think this system also works really well. I guess what is really important right now is not to worry about the concept of it as much but rather let the users of the language itself try it out and see what they think could be better.\n\nAlso good point about `pkg.rs`! Changed it.\n",

    "body": "The scenario I'm hoping to streamline is the \"throw a library on github that consists of a handful of source files and nothing terribly special about building them\". So if you imagine creating a library `github.com/user/foo` with files `src/foo.rs`, `src/util.rs` and `src/tests.rs`, then you could picture the thing being buildable with a search rule like:\n- If a file `pkg.rs` exists in the root, use it\n- if not, take the URL stem `foo` and look for a file called `foo.rs` in the repo. If there's exactly one, use it.\n- Otherwise error\n\nWould that be stable / deterministic enough?\n\nThe main thing is to derive as much as possible through convention or information implied in the existing structure of a pile of source files. Including the inter-package dependency: an `extern mod foo = \"github.com/user/foo\";` directive in someone else's code should be enough for rustpkg to find and build the external library.\n\nAnyway, as you say this is _somewhat_ academic. I'm fine with the rest of the code. It's moving in the right direction, r+\n\n(Also @Kimundi, keep in mind, `.rc` files are going away; we only maintain support for that file stem right now out of sloth / compatibility with existing stuff we haven't renamed / reorganized yet.)\n",

Using the local directory by default is something I like about cargo. I don't want my four Rust workspaces all competing over resources under `~/.rustpkg`, and I don't want to wipe out all my builds globally when something goes wrong in one project\n\nTrying to run `hunter`:\n- When I `rustpkg build` inside the `rustpkg-test2` directory I don't know what happened to the binary.\n- I tried to `rustpkg prefer hunter` but 'package not found'\n- Then I `rustpkg install` and that did something different\n- Then `rustpkg prefer hunter` and finally my binary moves to `~/.rustpkg/bin`\n\nThere are three commands involved here and the relationship isn't clear to me. `build` and `install` both went and did some work behind the scenes, but neither gave me a binary to run. What is 'build' for? Can 'install' give me the binary by default?\n\n`rustpkg install` will 'install from the cwd' but `rustpkg uninstall` won't 'uninstall from the cwd'.\n\n`rustpkg uninstall rabbit` caused a segfault. Now my database is locked. After removing the lock the database doesn't parse (db.json is 0KB).\n",

    "body": "This design is committed to the approach of compiling a program `package.rs` to compile your program, but it also augments that program with some syntax [extensions](https://github.com/z0w0/rust/blob/2d58417fd811b523a6a5dabb7bc57f1e6f0d0f4d/src/librustpkg/util.rs), apparently injecting some implicit declarations and calls into the source code.\n\nHow much does the design depend on this approach and will adding further features to the compiler require adding more syntax transformations? This sort of code can be frustrating to maintain and I don't want it getting out of control. At the least please make sure that all functions and type referenced by your generated code all live in the same module - dedicate `rustpkg::rt` (or similar) to 'things that rustpkg-generated code might call' (it can start as just a bunch of `pub use`). Don't generate calls into random library code because the breakage when that code changes is hard to track down.\n\nAlso please design these syntax transformations with the intent that they all fit into a syntax extension or compiler pass. `package.rs` should not be 'a rustpkg file'; it is just a Rust source file.\n",

    "body": "Semver is a standard for versions, used by Node.js http://semver.org/. @erickt made it and I just added it in because some sort of version standard is needed and semver is very popular.\n\nI based the AST generation off of the test bootstrap, because it was very close to what I needed and I couldn't find any other examples to use, so all of the issues you mention are inherited from the test bootstrap. I don't understand why rustpkg wouldn't be linked in by default, the whole point is to make it work out of the box.\n\nInstalling/building everything into `~/.rustpkg` was kind of the point. When you're working with a purely functional package manager there's generally no conflicts to worry about. What if it were to build into `./.rustpkg/bin` with `rustpkg build` and then when you `rustpkg install` it into `~/.rustpkg/bin`, would that be better?\n",

Then the user can set `PATH=./.rustpkg/bin:~/.rustpkg/bin:$PATH` and similar for `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and off they go.\n\nThe key is for builds to be \"purely functional\" in the sense of capturing _all_ dependencies, which means the semvers fed in from local workspaces with their own diffs from a release tag should include a \"patch level\" encoding the git rev of the local workspace, because they're different sources: they produce a different artifact that the user might want to switch to using. Might also need to consider the toolchain used to build as a dependency. And probably a few other things too. Pure functional package management needs to be quite careful.\n",

Nobody wants to do anything that results in absurdity or breakage.\n\nLet's not block this pull (which includes such pedestrian matters as \"renaming cargo to rustpkg and starting a new code lineage\") on the issue of version collision, considering almost nothing else in the remaining infrastructure (from library naming to build caching) exists or works properly yet.\n\nMy feeling is this is good enough to land (cargo didn't solve versions either) and we can continue to discuss. r+ from me, is anyone else too worried to let it proceed? \n",
