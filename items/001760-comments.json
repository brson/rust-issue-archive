    "body": "Hi tychosci. This is looking great, but I have one quibble about how the system cargo files are installed. This appears to put them under `$sysroot/.cargo/...` which in practice is `/usr/local/.cargo`. This is a strange place for us to be dropping a custom folder. I would expect the system install to not use the `.cargo` folder and just put libs under `/usr/local/lib`, bins under `/usr/local/bin` so that they are on all the normal search paths (rustc already looks here). I can make this change myself, but I'd like to hear your and @graydon's opinion.\n",
