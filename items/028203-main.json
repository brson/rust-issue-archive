  "body": "I have two issues with the section \"Deref and method calls\" of the book's chapter \"Deref coercions\".\n- (Minor) It says \"In other words, these are the same two things in Rust:\", followed by a code block in which no two things seem similar, much less the same. Presumably this sentence made more sense in a previous revision.\n- The next paragraph conflates two concepts which, imho, should kept separate. They are\n  - deref coercion, i.e. inserting as many `*` as necessary and\n  - implicitly referencing the receiver, i.e. inserting a single `&` to satisfy the method's `self` parameter type.\n\nI appreciate that with the proposed changes the example becomes very contrived, even for a foo-bar-baz one. However, the current exmplanation is just wrong.\n",
