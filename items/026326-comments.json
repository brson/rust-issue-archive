It is indeed mostly a trans improvement (improves translation from 89.6s to 79.3s, but type-checking from 62.6s to 59s) - probably because of workload differences between rustc and trans. Still nice.\n\nI guess the mostly-uniformity of profiling info across rustc isn't worth much - I _really_ need to profile other crates too.\n",
