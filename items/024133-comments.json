    "body": "Ok I chatted with @aturon today about this, and our feeling is that this probably wants to go through an RFC. We couldn't really reach consensus among ourselves and would like to garner some broader opinions. Some specific points we had in mind were:\n- This is a breaking change happening in the beta period, and we currently have not made any breaking changes. There's a lot of discussion on this right now though!\n- It's hard to justify the `Sync` bound for something other than \"so this can be in an `Arc`\"\n- It's unclear how important a `Clone` implementation is for `IoError` as there aren't too many use cases for it today. Besides what you're describing, I don't think this has been encountered much elsewhere. Plus you can make an `IoError` cloneable today by using `Rc` if really necessary.\n\nSo to move forward here I'm going to close this for now. Could you open either an RFC or discuss post on this topic to see how others feel about it as well? Thanks!\n",
