    "body": "I've already registered my arguments against this in the comments on #8326. To reiterate the most important points:\n1. It's a method defined specifically for dead-simple repetition. If you're doing anything more clever than that, such as `break`ing, you're doing it wrong.\n2. As a simple method, it's designed to be an approachable example of `do` notation, higher-order functions, and defining methods on builtin types. It's tailor-made for tutorials and tiny code examples, which are Important For Marketing.\n3. It's more clear in its intent than `for _ in range(0, x)`, especially if the anticipated ability to omit `_ in` is intractable. I still get friction every time that I do this in Python, out of fear of forgetting whether the upper bound is inclusive or exclusive.\n4. It's just damn useful!\n\n```\n$ git grep \"do.*times\" | wc -l\n127\n$ git grep \"for.*range\" | wc -l\n256\n```\n\nEven before external iterators we'd had the ability to do `for range(0, x) |_|`, and people still preferred `times`.\n1. In total it's 12 lines of dead-simple code. No maintenance cost.\n\nTo repeat, I'm fine with removing all uses of `times` from the compiler if you think it will speed up build times by half a second. But removing the interface entirely is unwarranted.\n",

I don't think `Times` comes close to being worth a module, an implementation for every unsigned integer type and different a looping idiom. If a user does use `Times` and hits a closure capture error, it's not obvious that they can just switch to the _regular_ looping mechanism since this isn't explained anywhere.\n",
