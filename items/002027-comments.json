    "body": "I'm not sure it's feasible to get rid of this given the new linked failure mechanism. Even with a message-based tree, spawn_unlinked gives us the possibility of \"losing track\" of tasks, if we hope to get all of them inductively through failure propagation.\n\nI'd suggest relying on pipes' behaviour of closing-in-destructors, so when failure propagates tasks wouldn't need to get explicitly punted awake, but as long as there's the possibility of deadlocking pipe reads, that can't work either.\n\nIn short, not sure it makes sense to do this.\n",
