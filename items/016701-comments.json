    "body": "It's impossible because `uint::MAX` is defined to be the maximum possible number of addressable bytes and there are various reasons why 20 bytes will certainly be used. One reason is that the main stack size must be at least 4k. I think we should clearly define some assumptions about `int` and `uint`, such as whether `int` can address the whole address space with the positive range. I don't have an opinion on the best choices right now.\n\nOn modern operating systems, the kernel gets half of the address space and userspace gets the other half, so saying `int` can address the whole range won't lose anything. On bare hardware without that distinction, the guarantee would make 1 bit of the address space unusable. It could just be considered a portability issue as long as there's documentation to that effect somewhere - new ports may need to add a check, but no existing one needs it.\n",
