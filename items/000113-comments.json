    "body": "Bug in the new typechecker, it should catch that. Trans trapping late like that is no fun.\n\nThe residual behavior is what I'd expect though: changing int to uint makes it complain at the initialization point, yes? Because 3 is an int, not a uint. And changing uint to int makes it compile, because then everyone's dealing with ints everywhere and there's no error.\n\nWhat did you mean by interface conversion?\n",

    "body": "I agree the residual behavior is right. I though it would \"expect\" uint (the function's return type) and find int, but instead it's the other way around. That's just a UI issue, though, nothing to do with correctness.\n\nBy interface conversion, I meant something like\n    type intfc = obj { fn foo(); };\n    obj impl() { fn foo() {} }\n    fn bar() -> intfc { ret impl(); }\nwhere it needs to convert a concrete type to an interface type.\n",
