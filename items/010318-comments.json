    "body": "I agree that this needs a library interface to be more useful. The original intent with the new format strings was to allow extensions for things like i18n and such, and even programs such as this could in theory be possible.\n\nI don't think that there's any feasible usage outside of a macro due to the way it's structured. You're right in that this would likely require that all the arguments implement the same trait instead of having a mixture of possible traits. I would recommend taking a look at the expansion of the `format!` macro to see how it works, because this would likely employ something similar.\n\nSadly I'm not sure that this would be entirely useful until we get syntax extension import/export working because I do really think that this belongs in a library as opposed to the compiler (which I would love to move fmt::{print,format,println} to the prelude).\n",
