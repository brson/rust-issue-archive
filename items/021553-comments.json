    "body": "Looked into this and saw a few things incase anyone else is looking into it.\n1. `\"--markdown-playground-url=http://play.rust-lang.org\".to_string(),` is missing from the `rustdoc_args` in `src/rustbook/build.rs`. Adding this however does not get it to work because of the next items.\n2. The template used to render the rustbook is from `src/librustdoc/markdown.rs` where as for the documentation it is in `src/librustdoc/html/layout.rs`. This is important as the template in `layout.rs` includes the `playpen.js`.\n3. I tried to include `playpen.js` into the output but this still did not work, it is missing the tag from which it gets the code. This seems to be because `s.push_str(&format!(\"<span class='rusttest'>{}</span>\", Escape(&test)));` line does not get executed in `src/librustdoc/html/markdown.rs`\n\nHope this helps.\n",
