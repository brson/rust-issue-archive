    "body": "I've fixed all of the bugs I thought were blocking this, and have been left with more fundamental issues.\n\nI was trying to solve this by making an impl of `ExtendedIter` for all instances of `BaseIter`:\n\n```\nimpl<A, I: BaseIter<A>> I: iter::ExtendedIter<A> {\n...\n}\n```\n\nThis now sort of works. There are some big downsides, though, that all stem from the fact that _all_ calls of methods in ExtendedIter will immediately resolve to this impl. This means that autoderef and implicit borrows won't work when calling these methods, since the original type will match, and it also means that no other trait or impl can use method names that are also used by `ExtendedIter`, since there will be multiple matching methods.\n\nSo I'm not going to finish fixing the things it breaks. I'm going to unassign myself.\n\nThe right way to get rid of this is going to be using default implementations as tracked in #2794.\n",
