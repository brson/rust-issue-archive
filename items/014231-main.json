  "body": "The current suite of benchmarks for the standard distribution take a significant\namount of time to run, but it's unclear whether we're gaining any benefit from\nrunning them. Some specific pain points:\n- No one is looking at the data generated by the benchmarks. We have no graphs\n  or analysis of what's happening, so all the data is largely being cast into\n  the void.\n- No benchmark has ever uncovered a bug, they have always run successfully.\n- Benchmarks not only take a significant amount of time to run, but also take a\n  significant amount of time to compile. I don't think we should mitigate this\n  for now because it's useful to ensure that they do indeed still compile.\n\nThis commit disables --bench test runs by default as part of `make check`,\nflipping the NO_BENCH environment variable to a PLEASE_BENCH variable which will\nmanually enable benchmarking. If and when a dedicated bot is set up for\nbenchmarking, this flag can be enabled on that bot.\n",
