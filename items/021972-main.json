  "body": "This is a resurrection and heavy revision/expansion of a PR that pcwalton did to resolve #8861.\n\nThe most relevant, user-visible semantic change is this:  if a type expression for some value has a destructor, then any lifetimes referenced within that type expression must _strictly outlive_ the scope of the value.\n\nSee discussion on https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/769, especially for the discussion of the meaning of \"strictly outlive.\"\n\n---\n\nA previous version of this pull request also removed the `#[unsafe_destructor]` attribute, as well as the analysis that would reject generic `Drop` impls that were not annotated with that attribute.  For the short term, however, we are landing _just_ the new, stricter, believed-to-be sound analysis; there is still work remaining on #8861 before we could be comfortable removing the `#[unsafe_destructor]` attribute.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
