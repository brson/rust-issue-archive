    "body": "Didn't realize that we link with the old lseek implementations on 32-bit (without support for >4GB files), should I fix that in libc.rs or just leave it?\n\nThat would change off_t to 64-bits on non-Windows / non-Android platforms, and would make us compatible with C.\n1. OS X only has 64-bit off_t, so 32-bit builds there are currently wrong. (https://github.com/anatol/xnu/blob/master/bsd/sys/_types.h)\n2. On Windows, seek takes a i32/i64 apparently, and off_t is apparently 32-bit even on 64-bit processors (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/323b6b3k.aspx) so there we are also currently wrong.\n3. On Linux / FreeBSD off_t is either 32-bit or 64-bit long, and a compile-time switch in C changes it (on the kernel-side it is always 64-bit long) so making it 64-bit would probably make us more compatible with C.\n4. Android only has 32-bit off_t, so it should also be left 32-bit.\n",
