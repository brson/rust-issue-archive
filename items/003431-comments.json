Perhaps they need a protocol to talk about which files aren't ready yet, and to notify when they become ready.  Cargo would act as a router for this protocol.  Alternately it could pass a list of not-ready files and each `rustc` process would watch them with `inotify` or similar (avoiding races will be tricky).\n\nThe hardest part of this may be the dynamic job management to balance CPU utilization and peak RAM use when many `rustc` processes are blocking on file updates.\n",
