    "body": "It was an [explicit decision in the RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0369-num-reform.md) rather than an unintended consequence. These traits are not well all suited to generic code because they disregard the good practice of using `&T` in generics / traits when ownership is not required. Arbitrary precision floating point types would not fit into the current trait definitions at all. You would need to file an RFC if you wanted to propose a design change, as it's not a bug or missing feature.\n",
