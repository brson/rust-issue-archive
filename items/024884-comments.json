    "body": "Looks good, and I'm excited to have proper checking of error diagnostics across crates. One problem I see here is that we might compare metadata from an old build of a crate with a new build of the current crate. I think to avoid some false positives, that when a crate is built, we should delete its file and the files of any dependencies. Unfortunately, I don't know how to do that because rustc doesn't have access to the deps. I guess this could be built in to our build system, but that sounds kinda tough.\n\nAnyway, if you've got any ideas for how to do this, it would be great, otherwise, I think this can land as is (well, with the other comments addressed).\n\nAlso, I think, if possible, it would be good to pull out all the diagnostics stuff into its own crate, rather than have it in libsyntax (obvs, doesn't need to be done to land this, but if you'd like to do it in the future it would be appreciated).\n",

    "body": "@nrc: I've addressed your comments as best I could. In light of lints possibly getting error codes (#24900) I completed removed all mentions of crates from the metadata module. I also made the metadata dir adjustable via the `ERROR_METADATA_DIR` environment variable.\n\nAs far as stale errors go, I think we're unlikely to run into issues unless a crate is renamed or an error is moved from one crate to another. In either case the error message about where the duplicate was found should allow the problem to be resolved quickly. The current code deals with old metadata for the same crate by ignoring any metadata with a matching name.\n\nI'm also happy to pull the diagnostics stuff into its own crate at some point :smile:\n",
