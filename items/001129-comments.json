    "body": "So this looks really great! Thank you. I made a number of comments, but mostly on style. One thing to note is that functions without naturaldocs comments (starting with \"Function:\") will not show up in the library documentation at all, so every public function needs documentation.\n\nThis patch does establish a naming convention 'loop' and a protocol (return bool) for iterators that can break early, which I guess is as good as any.\n\nI would very much like it if you provided tests for std::rope. They would live in src/test/stdtest/rope.rs\n",
