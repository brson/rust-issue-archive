    "body": "So @pnkfelix raised this question of the fact that `Copy: Sized`. Here are some (somewhat scattered) thoughts on this topic. TL;DR is that I think the current design is ok and there are lots of ways forward but I'm not sure on the best one.\n\nFirst, Copy today combines two things: \"affine\" and \"can be memcpy\". We've thought about separating this in the past (`Pod`), but decided against it because it didn't seem worthwhile if the reason was simply to act as a lint. Unsized values present a more interesting case though.\n\nI personally expect unsized values to be affine. Currently, they can never be moved by the compiler, but the only way that they could that I can see is we passed a pointer into the current location (since the size is not known to the compiler at compilation time). I've described this before as permitting unsized values to be passed as parameters. This only makes sense if all unsized things are affine, because otherwise when the callee mutates the value, it will mutate a copy that the caller can see, which violates the mental model.\n\nIf we did support moves, then you could _move_ a `[T]` (or `Trait`) into an `Rc` -- for any `T`. I think this is probably what you really wanted to do, not to copy or clone. And if it was copy or clone that you wanted, you could achieve that for slices at least by calling `to_vec` first and then moving out of the vec.\n\nIt seems like wanting to copy/clone a `[T]` into an `Rc` will be relatively uncommon (versus move), and traits even more so. The former could also be achieved with a special case method that takes a `&[T]` for `T: Clone` and clones it into an `Rc` (which seems more general than the copy case). The trait case could be covered via a `CloneInto` trait, as has been tossed around from time to time.\n\nFinally, we _could_ add a `Pod` trait as has been discussed, with a blanket impl that says `T: Copy => T: Pod`. This would probably interact poorly with coherence in the absence of specialization, though. This would be similar to the prior proposal but with different aims, since here one would want to avoid linearity not because of a \"lint-like\" use but because of unsized values. Still, of all the ways forward, it's the least appealing to me.\n",
