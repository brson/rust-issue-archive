    "body": "This would be a bit tricky because currently every program links to the `rustuv` crate, and I don't think that any of the ever explicitly use it at all. It registers something to be put in the crate map, which is considered as \"using' the `rustuv` crate, but this doesn't happen until translation time.\n\nThat being said, we have lots of lints for other unused things, so why not `extern mod` as well!\n",

    "body": "Hello,\nSeeing the tag `E-easy`, I gave a try to this. While creating the lint itself was indeed pretty easy, there is currently no tracking of whether an `extern crate` as been used or not in `librustc/middle/resolve.rs` (where the tacking of used imports is done). So at my point, every `extern crate` is marked as unused by the lint checker.\nBut the tracking code of imports itself seems to be a side effect of the whole resolve code, and thus it is quite difficult to understand the whole thing enough to add tracking of extern crates as well. I'm not sure whether I'll manage to figure it out or not.\n",
