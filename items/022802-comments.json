    "body": "So how would you expect `take_while` to know when to stop unless it _also_ evaluates the first element that does not fulfill the condition? I suppose it could demand an iterator that is `std::iter::Peekable`, but even that would not be sufficient, because the iterator trait says:\n\n>  The Iterator protocol does not define behavior after None is returned. A concrete Iterator implementation may choose to behave however it wishes, either by returning None infinitely, or by doing something else.\n\nSo when _all_ items match the `take_while` condition (e.g. by changing the condition to `|a| **a < 100`) the `it` in your example does not guarantee _any_ behavior.\n\nI suppose `take_while` could mention its behavior in the documentation, but apart from that I don't think there's anything that can be done here.\n",
