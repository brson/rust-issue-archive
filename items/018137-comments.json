This week @aturon and I have taken a close look at `std::io` and all known outstanding issues with the module, and we'll be writing up an RFC for the module quite soon. For now I'm going to close this PR as we're going to discuss the `skip` issue in the RFC, which should help the outcome of this PR maintain consistency with the rest of the module.\n\nThanks for being patient, and I'll try to be sure to keep you updated on the status of the RFC (coming soon!).\n",
