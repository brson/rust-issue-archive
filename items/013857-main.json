  "body": "When a syntax extension is loaded by the compiler, the dylib that is opened may\nhave other dylibs that it depends on. The dynamic linker must be able to find\nthese libraries on the system or else the library will fail to load.\n\nCurrently, unix gets by with the use of rpaths. This relies on the dylib not\nmoving around too drastically relative to its dependencies. For windows,\nhowever, this is no rpath available, and in theory unix should work without\nrpaths as well.\n\nThis modifies the compiler to add all -L search directories to the dynamic\nlinker's set of load paths. This is currently managed through environment\nvariables for each platform.\n\nCloses #13848\n",
