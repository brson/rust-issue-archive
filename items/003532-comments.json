    "body": "I would not be wholly opposed to permitting references to items inside functions this way. It's not like they do dynamic environment capture. But I suspect there's a namespace-theoretic reason why we can't (i.e. the reason for the type/module and value namespaces to be separate still exists?)\n\nAlternatives to _that_ seem to me like they'd be difficult to express in AST code without some even-more-odious magic (naming by defid?) and in any case, obvious workarounds exist and this bug is entirely backwards compatible if we ever make it work. I think this is probably far-future if anything.\n\nI'm curious what you mean by reflection-based runners. Did you want to switch the test-running strategy to do that at some point? We don't really have a bug open for crate-structure reflection. Maybe we should!\n",
