    "body": "So far we have `append()` and `append_one()` that behave in this same way. I think that's sufficient precedent for an `append_all_move()`, although since `append()` is the equivalent of `push_all()` then it should probably be named `append_move()`.\n\nThat said, I'm a bit leery about adding more stuff to Vec that's literally the existing stuff done in a functional style. What's next, a function version of `reverse()`? How about `sort_by()`?\n\nPerhaps it's better to investigate an alternative approach. Once we have by-value closures, I would suggest something like\n\n``` rust\npub fn with(mut self, f: |&mut Vec<T>|) -> Vec<T> {\n    f(&mut self);\n    self\n}\n```\n\nThis will abstract away all the mutating methods so they can work in a functional style. So instead of `return_a_vec().append(slice)` you'd say `return_a_vec().with(|v| v.push_all(slice))`.\n\nWithout by-value closures, this would work for things like that `push_all()` above, but it won't work for e.g. your `append_all_move()`. But by-value closures are coming soon.\n",

    "body": "Hm, a few random thoughts:\n- I'd very much like to see any `append`/`push` method that clones from a slice be removed and replaced with something that just takes a iterator. More composable, and less API duplication. But it might need something like a iterable trait to be ergonomical.\n- In the same way, I'd very much like to see all the `append` methods go away and be expressed through some composable way with `push()` (or with the iterator `extend()`). Again, the current way duplicates API for a different use case that exists for _all_ types in Rust.\n- `with` might solve that and could be a generic trait impl for all types, but that might be overkill.\n",
