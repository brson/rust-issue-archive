    "body": "@cmr Here are some quick results from googling:\n- Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28computer_science%29#Dynamic_scoping this link points out that while some single-threaded runtime systems use global variables to implement dynamic scope (and you just save/restore the old value on the stack), such an implementation strategy is a bad idea in the presence of multiple threads.\n- SRFI 39: http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html  The Scheme community has largely settled on the term \"parameter (object)\" for the concept of a variable whose state is computed from the (thread-local) stack, so that you can override e.g. the current output port (or exception-handler, or other state you do not want to thread through your procedure arguments) on one thread without disrupting others.\n- Racket's parameterize documentation: http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/parameterize.html  This is perhaps a bit more readable than SRFI 39.  It gives some small examples, and again points out that `parameterize` is a better solution than global variables (a la `set!`).\n",

Or maybe we're better off just starting fresh with a new ticket and/or RFC.\n",
