    "body": "This is because attributes only work on items, and objects and methods are not items. Probably the best you can do in this situation is define a function inside the fsync method and conditionalize that. I believe that will work.\n\n```\nobj FILE_writer(f: os::libc::FILE, res: option::t<@FILE_res>) {\n  fn fsync() {\n    fsync_()\n\n    #[cfg(target_os = \"macos\")]\n    fn fsync_() {  macos_os::fsync(f) }\n\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt probably would not be difficult to allow attributes and conditional compilation on methods as well. Attributes on general expressions is harder.\n",
