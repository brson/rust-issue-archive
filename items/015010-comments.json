I agree with @kballard that adding an `autofocus` is not the best solution, now that I know about `s`, but `s` and other options should be more noticeable. I'll do this in another pull request right now, as it's a separate change, and we can move discussion there.\n\nUPDATE: #15012 changes the placeholder text.\n",
