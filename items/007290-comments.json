    "body": "I believe this is the numerous workspaces warming up, building initial llvms. Six new slaves are online, each with about six builder workspaces to populate. Once all these fill in I believe things will improve.\n\nOne way to make things better would be to improve support in the build system for reusing the llvm bits in the snapshot.\n\nI'll continue to monitor differences in slave performance in the meantime, for further opportunities to improve cycle time.\n",

    "body": "@graydon Also, master-linux often fails as a timeout during testing, meaning an hour without output. I'm not sure if that's from an error in the tests or from it taking so long to build the test crate. I'm inclined towards the latter, when it does pass it seems to take around 4-5 hours.\n",
