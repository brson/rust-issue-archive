    "body": "I think that the consensus was that \n- bare functions are now written `native fn`;\n- native functions, for now, will also be typed as `native fn`, but eventually they will be `native \"abi\" fn`;\n- the `native * fn` types will be a single function pointer.\n\nThe wrapper functions we generate today will be removed but I expect the shim functions will stay, as they are still needed to handle the various backends in a relatively simple way.  For invoking `native \"abi\" fn(T) -> U` types where the link name is not known (i.e., by ptr), we'll need a \"by ptr\" shim (there would be one \"by ptr\" shim for every unique native type that is invoked in the crate).  We could only have a \"by ptr\" shim and use it for all native function invocations with that type at the cost of an extra call by ptr (but it would reduce generated code size).  Maybe we should start that way until the performance costs of native calls make us switch.\n\nAnd of course there is always #1402 to contend with.  But that's an internal change to the shim functions, basically.\n",
