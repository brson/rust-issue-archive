    "body": "The guide is inconsistent with its use of certain conventions. These don't really have a correct form, but a single style should be enforced.\n- Single-quotes (`'`) versus double-quotes (`\"`) in prose. Example:\n  \n  ``` md\n  The first thing we'll learn about are 'variable bindings.'\n  ```\n  \n  ``` md\n  Well, Rust has this thing called \"type inference.\"\n  ```\n- Periods and commas within quotes versus without. Example:\n  \n  ``` md\n  A struct is another form of a 'record type,'\n  ```\n  \n  ``` md\n  This operator is called 'modulo',\n  ```\n- \"different from\" versus \"different than\". Example:\n  \n  ``` md\n  This is different from named functions\n  ```\n  \n  ``` md\n  Rust's macros are significantly different than C macros\n  ```\n- \"filename\" versus \"file name\"\n",

    "body": "@apasel422 thanks for being specific. And for your earlier pull request. As for these...\n- They should be double quotes. Ideally, they'd even be actual curlies rather than `\"`.\n- Periods and commas go within in almost all cases. In both of the cases you show, they should go inside.\n- \"Different from\" vs. \"Different than\" isn't something that's generally settled. Some styles choose it in different situations, others say \"from\" is the only correct way to say this.\n- \"file name\" is my preferred way, though there's no specific actual guidance.\n",
