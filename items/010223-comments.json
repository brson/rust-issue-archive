    "body": "The Gamma distribution is pretty fundamental, and it actually opens the way for extremely short implementations of a variety of other reasonably common distributions (for most, the actual sampling implementation is a line or two of arithmetic, so the largest part of the code will be the documentation & tests). Such distributions include:\n- Chi-squared\n- F\n- Beta\n- Student's t\n\nI'm not sure how many of these are desired to be in libstd, but as some points of reference: C++11 (and Boost) has all of the above but Beta, and Python's stdlib has _only_ Beta. (Personally, I'd say all, since they are literally some simple arithmetic done to one or two of the other distributions (once this lands) in `std::rand::distributions`.)\n",
