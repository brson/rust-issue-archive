Regardless, at bare minimum, creating a staticlib with the name `foo` and then running `gcc` with `-lfoo` should continue to work in MinGW. If it works with either `libfoo.a` or `foo.lib` then it probably doesn't matter too much if we special-case MinGW.\n",

    "body": "With -msvc, when creating a dylib it'll produce a `foo.lib` import library. Since `.a` is wrong for -msvc this means that when creating a staticlib the only choice is `libfoo.lib`, otherwise it would conflict with the dylib's import library. Do note that this means users would have to pass `libfoo` to the linker, they wouldn't be able to just pass `foo`, but they already can't do that with the existing wrong choice of `libfoo.a` so there's no worries about breaking that here.\n\nFor -gnu, when creating dylibs, no import library is produced. This means that we have several choices, `libfoo.a` which is what we currently use, `foo.lib` which would work with `-lfoo` but would be oddly inconsistent from the -msvc version which has the extra lib prefix, and `libfoo.lib` which would match -msvc but break `-lfoo`. So for -gnu I'm leaning towards sticking with `libfoo.a` since it doesn't cause inconsistencies and wouldn't break anything.\n",
