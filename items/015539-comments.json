    "body": "I think that the new Guide is way better than the old Tutorial was. \nSee, it's a guide, not a reference, (we have the Manual for that). \nThe Guide is meant to teach the reader about Rust and systems programming in an engaging manner, like a good book would. There's certainly a place for a more formal format as well, but that is what the manual is for. \n\nMaybe it is because I haven't had much previous experience with systems programming, however the Guide is very accessible and this makes it easier for people like me to jump on the Rust train.  I have some limited C++ experience, which is certainly helping, but the attitude that one has to know the old in order to learn the new is I think preventing many new programmers from trying some of these newer languages. \n\nFor a lot of people, it comes down to cost/benefit analysis: If I have to know C++ well in order to get into Rust, I'm just not going to invest the time into Rust but instead into C++, because of the much more established ecosystem. If instead I can jump onto Rust from e.g. Ruby/Python/JavaScript background as well, can learn at my own pace and don't have to first invest into C++ then I'm sold. \n\nA lot of people adopted the dynamic languages precisely because they could be picked up from scratch and to be honest the dynamic people are one of the most active open-source communities here on GitHub, (Just check the amount of JavaScript pouting in every day) and if we manage to capture their interest the Rust ecosystem will greatly benefit. \n\nJust look at Go, released less than 5 years ago and where it is today, thanks to the people coming over from Python/Ruby. I am not saying the Guide should be accessible to everybody, however it should be accessible to people without previous C++ experience and I think @steveklabnik  does a great job at achieving this goal.\n\nAs far as the car analogy, well sure - not every analogy's so great, but that goes for a lot of books, TV shows etc. as well and I think as long as a point is made clearly, the particular analogy doesn't really matter that much. \n",

    "body": "> Cargo is a tool that Rustaceans use to help manage their Rust projects. Cargo is currently in an alpha state, just like Rust, and so it is still a work in progress. However, it is already good enough to use for many Rust projects, and so it is assumed that Rust projects will use Cargo from the beginning.\n> \n> Programmers love car analogies, so I've got a good one for you to think about the relationship between cargo and rustc: rustc is like a car, and cargo is like a robotic driver. You can drive your car yourself, of course, but isn't it just easier to let a computer drive it for you?\n\nI find analogies are ultimately distracting and unhelpful. Rather than saying what cargo is like, it's better to say what it actually is. It's probably better to first explain what cargo is, before explaining that it's in alpha state.\n",

I wonder what our Documentation Master @steveklabnik thinks...\n\nIt is a tricky thing, though: beginners need to be taught with an understanding that these concepts are complicated, take time to learn, and are not simple; I think the current tutorial does that very well. More experienced people see things like type systems and pointers as obvious and simple and feel talked-down-to when those concepts are given too much time and treated too simply for their tastes.\n\nPerhaps its more like a 2-part tutorial, where the \"beginner\" section leads into the \"experienced\" section, and at the beginning, there is a suggestion that those with more experience may want to jump to Part 2? That still has its drawbacks, as you have to balance between covering everything in the right place for each group and trying not to repeat yourself, but maybe...\n",
