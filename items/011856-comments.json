    "body": "I want to bump this a bit because I think this is security related.\n\nCurrently the `WindowsPath::is_absolute()` behavior is downright dangerous.  The generic path behavior for `is_absolute()` defines this as such:\n\n> Returns whether self represents an absolute path. An absolute path is defined as one that, when joined to another path, will yield back the same absolute path.\n\nDifferent working directories on different drives is a concept long gone.  The only software that still has this is `cmd.exe` and it emulates it.  (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/10/11/10073890.aspx)\n\nThe reason the current behavior is dangerous because you can end up trusting `is_absolute()` to the current behavior to implement path manipulation algorithms where you expect the end result to not escape a certain folder when used in a certain context.  (Obviously that by itself does not help you but you might make wrong conclusions from it).\n",

    "body": "This issue isn't done yet, because we still need to implement a way to turn volume relative paths into true absolute paths. This means getting the current working directory for that drive and joining the paths.\n\nWhile `cmd.exe` has a variable current directory for each drive, Win32 has only a single variable current directory. Unfortunately Win32 still has immutable current directories set at process startup for each drive which it respects when interpreting volume relative paths.\n\nAt first I thought we were doomed because `GetCurrentDirectory` only returns that single current directory and not the drive specific current directories. Furthermore if we don't want to be limited by `MAX_PATH` we can't call `GetFullPathName` with the full path. As it turns out, however, we can simply call `GetFullPathName` with just the prefix like `C:` and it'll give us the correct current directory on which to join the rest of the path.\n",
