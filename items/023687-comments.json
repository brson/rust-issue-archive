    "body": "Additionally, there is inconsistency between cmp::min/max and foo.iter().min/max as can be seen here: http://is.gd/aSAlz0\n\nIt should be mentioned that the author of [`max`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/max/) in STL considers their implementation to be wrong, as it returns `a` when `a == b` which loses the stability property. Which, when used for sorting can lead to unnecessary swaps.\n\nIt would be nice to get this consistent across the board.\n\ncc @aturon \n",
