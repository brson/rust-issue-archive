  "body": "This is a behavioral difference in libuv between different platforms in\ndifferent situations. It turns out that libuv on windows will immediately\nallocate a buffer instead of waiting for data to be ready. What this implies is\nthat we must have our custom data set on the handle before we call\nuv_read_start.\n\nI wish I knew of a way to test this, but this relies to being on the windows\nplatform _and_ reading from a true TTY handle which only happens when this is\nactually attached to a terminal. I have manually verified this works.\n\nCloses #10645\n",
