The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @brson (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@bluss: i think in this situation it's actually the less error-prone way. So I don't think there's a clear way forward.\n\nOptions:\n1. always consume entire Iterator, error if the Iterator is too long\n2. consume exactly the number of elements needed for the array\n3. implement `FromIterator` for `Result<[T, N], ArrayFillError>` and return an `Err(TooFew)` or an `Err(TooMany(array, last_elem))` so you never loose anything. Not sure how well `.collect().unwrap()` works with inference\n",

    "body": "Panic is appropriate for [_contract violation_](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0236-error-conventions.md), and we use it for indexing errors for example.\n\nUsing it for not having enough elements, which could be a dynamic situation (you could filter more or less elements in an iterator chain for example) is not a good idea. I don't think it's a good fit for a contract violation. We say that \u201clibraries shouldn't panic\u201d, so libstd should live up to this as well.\n\nAn example of a better use is if an iterator promises to return `n` elements (with `size_hint` or `ExactSizeIterator`), and then it doesn't. Panic is appropriate, it's a contract violation.\n\nSince the FromIterator trait cannot handle errors, I don't think it's a good idea for arrays.\n\nThis is derived from my reasoning around ArrayVec and FromIterator, which has the opposite conclusion due to different circumstances: The ArrayVec can fit 0 to N elements fine; since the trait does not have a way to handle errors; superfluous elements are skipped silently; this way the function is total without any panic cases. This is ok since they can still be reachable from the iterator.\n",

    "body": "@Gankro I'd actually think that there's a more fundamental problem here, as pointed out by @bluss there's a question of what if the iterator is too short or too long. All other implementors of `FromIterator` are dynamically sized and can hence work with an iterator of any size, but this would be the first instance which panics unless the iterator is of an exact length.\n\nTagging with T-libs to discuss during triage, but I agree with @bluss that this may not be appropriate for the standard library right now.\n",
