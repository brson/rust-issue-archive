    "body": "I have implemented a fix for this locally, which makes `rustc` emit debuginfo for all calls and invokes, especially those to drop-glue. The reason why the assertion occurred relatively rarely was that sometimes a drop-glue function was generated by the compiler _between_ setting the debug location state intended for the call instruction and actually emitting the call instruction. Generating the drop-glue would then reset the debug location state, resulting in a call instruction without any debuginfo.\n\nThis side-effect based API for debuginfo source location is really rather nasty. We essentially read and write a global variable all the time and hope that nothing bad happens `:)` I'll have to think about how this situation can be improved.\n\nThe implemented fix needs some cleanup and more testing, so it will still take some time until I have pull request ready.\n",
