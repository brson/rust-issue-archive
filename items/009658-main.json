  "body": "This should fix some outstanding namespace issues. It also fixes an issue with LLVM metadata uniquing that caused an LLVM assertion when compiling libstd.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the `-O` flag and the debug info flags are essentially incompatible. It may work but I would not consider this in any way supported at the moment. On the other hand, there is also good news: With the changes in this PR I am able to compile all of rust with extra-debug-info:\n\n```\nmake RUSTFLAGS_STAGE2='-Zextra-debug-info' check\n```\n\ncompiles the whole thing without warning and passes the whole test suite (given that `configure` is run with `--disable-optimize`). That's kind of nice `:)` Still, I'm reluctant to automatically close the related issues (#9167, #9190, #9268) without confirmation from the openers. I'll post to the individual threads once this gets merged.\n",
