    "body": "I've been thinking about this for a while, actually.  The reason is clear: it's nice to make impls over types like `@T`, and if we always auto-deref'd prior to scanning for impl matches, that wouldn't work.  I don't know if the right behavior is to scan for matches with the original type, then auto-deref, then scan again, or what.  It's an annoying problem.\n",
