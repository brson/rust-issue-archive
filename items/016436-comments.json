Also of note, #9784 never even mentions the name `assert` anywhere. IIRC the only discussion that mentioned it was on discuss.rust-lang.org, but that's apparently dead right now so I can't find it.\n",

    "body": "Minutes PR is here: https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/pull/2\n\n\"Minutes\" is a bit of an overstatement, though -- at API review we generally log the decisions but not the conversation, which would be a significant effort to transcribe. I can look into the possibility of transcriptions for Guidelines discussions in the future, although the idea is that we only have such discussions when there's already a pretty clear consensus on the team.\n\nIn the meeting, I made sure that the main arguments against `assert` were well understood by everyone. But there wasn't much further discussion, because the team already understood those downsides but was still unanimously in favor of `assert`.\n\nI strongly disagree that this is an opaque process. We had substantial discussion on Discourse -- which was announced as the official venue of Guidelines discussion. Several perspectives were given and points rebutted. Every decision involves tradeoffs, and hence every decision has downsides. The downsides you pointed out about `assert` are valid, as are those that Niko initially pointed out. Nevertheless, on the whole we felt that the upsides outweighed them, and we made a decision.\n",

    "body": "When writing C++ the standard practice, for some years now, has been to assume that anything might throw an exception, unless when explicitly stated otherwise -- i.e. when the function has been explicitly declared exception safe (`noexcept`).\n\nThe community has reversed its previous position on exception specification. In fact, it was deprecated in C++11.\n\nI think we should learn from this and realise that the same circumstances apply to Rust. Any function might fail for any reason (due to its implementation/environment/etc) unless explicitly marked as safe. IMO Rust lacks in this regard.\n\n_The safe position is to assume that `unwrap` can fail, just like any ordinary function_.\n\nWhat is needed above and beyond this is means to guarantee _no fail_, as well as _transaction safety_, analogous to the strong execption safety guarantee in C++.\n",

    "body": "Discussion about the merits of using a method vs a `match` statement is a bit off topic. The bottom line is that we have been holding API review meetings (attended by Rust core team members along with some members of the community) and using those to harmonize and coordinate APIs, as well as to declare APIs as stable. This change is pursuant to the naming guidelines that have been developed and which were aired publicly to little controversy. This is the current procedure and I think it is a good one, though I agree we could do a better job of taking minutes.\n\nRegarding this change itself, the goal of the name `assert` is not to punish its users, but to clearly _and concisely_ express the intention (\"I assert that this `Option` is not `None`\") and to ensure that calls to `assert` are easily identified by code reviewers and so forth (which `unwrap` cannot do, as many types offer a safe variation on `unwrap`).\n",

There is little difference between (C code):\n\n``` c\nint foo(char *format )\n{\n    assert( format != NULL );\n    // other stuff\n```\n\nand\n\n``` rust\nfn foo(format: Option<String>) -> int {\n    let format = format.unwrap();\n```\n\nWith the name changed, this becomes\n\n``` rust\nfn foo(format: Option<String>) -> int {\n    let format = format.assert();\n```\n\nComparing:\n\n```\n    assert( format != NULL );\n    let format = format.assert();\n```\n\nOther than that one is a function and one is the method, feels very, very close to me.\n\nNote that also, the reason that `assert` doesn't need to return a value in C is because there's no concept of `Option` to begin with.

Yes `unwrap()` includes an assertion. It also returns a value though.\nIf I read `let x = y.assert()` my thoughts would be along the line of \"Why does an assertion return a value? What would that value be? Maybe whether the assertion was successful, so a bool? Probably won't fail then.\"\n\nThat said it seems to me most people agree that `unwrap()` is a terrible name. Hardly anybody is arguing for not renaming the function.\nIt seems to me that proposing to rename it to e.g.`unwrap_or_fail()` would be quite uncontroversial. It fulfils all the criteria mentioned. It documents the intention (which `assert()` doesn't IMHO), and it is easily grepable by reviewers.\n\nThe only real argument I have heard against reconsidering the name is \"But we decided this at a meeting\", which honestly seems a bit childish. I get that this can lead to bikeshedding, and that it needs a dictated decision, but I feel that choosing the one name that has lots of valid arguments against it, instead of any of the others, is misguided.\n",

    "body": "I am also very negative on `assert()`. I believe it is a fundamental mistake to assume that `Some 2` somehow implies success and `None` failure. As a matter of fact, it could be the opposite where `None` is the expected case and the `Some` is the failure case. 'assert()' would completely miss the meaning in this case. E.g.\n\n```\nif (x.is_some()) { println!(\"Something bad happened: {}\", x.assert()); return; }\n```\n\nI think that `unwrap_or_fail()` is a far better choice, but I would also consider `from_some()`.\n",

    "body": "As far as I'm aware, the primary motivator for changing `unwrap()` is the fact that we have other APIs that have an `unwrap()` method that cannot fail, and the idea was to make `unwrap()` be generically understood as a not-failing method.\n\nMy counter is that `Option::unwrap()` is almost certainly the most common usage by far of the method, and that if you want to have consistent failure semantics, the other APIs that have `unwrap()` should have their method renamed to something new. That said, I think the name `unwrap()` is short enough and evocative enough that I'm not sold on the failure semantics thing. The rule can be as simple as \"if called on a single-valued type, it can't fail. If called on a multi-value type (like `Option` or `Result`), it fails if it doesn't contain the correct value\".\n",

You're depending on that value being available, and you don't want to continue if it's not.\n\nI agree with the reasons above for not using `.assert()`, mainly because it doesn't suggest returning a value to me.\n",

    "body": "Clearly, this is a controversial topic. Our [original plan](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-July/010735.html) (see \"Consensus and Decisions\") was to use Discuss as the forum for discussing guidelines. We thought that the relative consensus on the Discuss thread reflected general agreement. Instead, it seems that a lot of people were just unaware of the proposal.\n\nSo we're going to amend our plan for developing guidelines. We can still have discussions on Discuss but afterwards we'll prepare an RFC summarizing the results. Of course it's often not possible to reach complete consensus, and in those cases it's ultimately the responsibility of the core team to finalize decisions and ensure they fit the overall design.\n\nIn this case, that means we can close this PR and @aturon will prepare a formal RFC describing the proposed changes and also putting them in a larger context. We will decide on this RFC in the weekly meetings as normal.\n\nI want to emphasize an important distinction between _guidelines_ and _library stabilization_. As I said, we'll use the RFC process for general guidelines that affect multiple libraries. But we will continue to use the stabilization meetings to make small-bore decisions about individual libraries, such as renaming methods for consistency or removing methods that receive little use. For those sorts of cases, a full RFC is overkill.\n",

Which there was in this case, in particular this response from @nikomatsakis : https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/16436#issuecomment-51970654.  (Better still, read over the entire comment thread, if that is feasible.)\n\nThis is not the first time your comments have reflected a lack of effort on your part to read over the general context before adding your two cents.  I can understand not reading every comment in a long thread, but in this case and others, you have been particularly rude.\n",

    "body": "@pnkfelix I apologize for my last comment (and maybe old ones), if you think it's \"particularly rude\". I'll make sure never leave rude comments, I promise. So don't ban me or put me into the blacklist or something else, please! I still want to be active in the Rust community. As a note, I did contribute to Rust source, docs and issues in the past, e.g. the latest #16448 / #16928.\n\nThe following is some explain for my last comment (both -1 has its reason in original comment already):\n\nThe core team posted on [discuss](http://discuss.rust-lang.org/t/settling-some-key-naming-conventions/269) first and quickly made decision only two days later without public [meeting report](https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/pull/2) (which was delayed merging for about two weeks). Both the post and the api meeting did not explicitly claim renaming `.unwrap()` to `.assert()`. They didn't post on reddit, which is definitely much more popular than discuss.rust-lang.org. As you have seen, many many people were [surprised](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2dbg3j/hm_unwrap_is_being_renamed_to_assert/) by renaming `unwrap` to `assert`. This was the reason why I said \"(make this decision and discuss it) in the corner\" and \"opaque process\" in my last comment. I did seen some core members explain \"why this is not opaque process\" before, but that's not convincing IMO.\n",

As long as you're a helpful member of the community, people will be happy to have you around. In particular, I don't think you need to justify yourself based on your contributions - those actions speak for themselves.\n\nHowever, everyone participating in this thread is well-aware of all of the points you brought up: they're the core issue at hand, and the reason for nikomatsakis' resolution above. So you're not adding anything to the discussion by simply restating/summarizing the core controversy. Especially in this case - where the issue has been acknowledged, and a long-term solution agreed upon by the core team.\n\nSo pnkfenix has a point here: developers dedicate time and energy to reading your posts and placing them in the context of an entire issue. The bare minimum respect you can have for others' time is to read the threads carefully before commenting. This makes the best possible use of everyone's time, including your own, since you won't have to deal with people complaining when you want to get your opinion heard.\n",
