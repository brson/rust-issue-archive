  "body": "Right now if you have concurrent builds of two libraries in the same directory\n(such as rustc's bootstrapping process), it's possible that two libraries will\nstomp over each others' metadata, producing corrupt rlibs.\n\nBy placing the metadata file in a tempdir we're guranteed to not conflict with\nay other builds happening concurrently. Normally this isn't a problem because\noutput filenames are scoped to the name of the crate, but metadata is special in\nthat it has the same name across all crates.\n",
