  "body": "While working on #11363 I stumbled over a couple of ignored tests, that seem to be fixed or invalid.\n- src/test/run-pass/issue-3559.rs was fixed in #4726\n- src/test/compile-fail/borrowck-call-sendfn.rs was fixed in #2978\n- update src/test/compile-fail/issue-5500-1.rs to work with current Rust (I'm not 100% sure if the original condition is tested as mentioned in #5500, but I think so)\n- removed src/test/compile-fail/issue-5500.rs because it is tested in\n  src/test/run-fail/issue-5500.rs (they are the same test cases, I just renamed src/test/run-fail/addr-of-bot.rs to be consistent with the other issue name\n",
