  "body": "See #21507\n\nBecause we only get an ID once the thread has been spawned, and at that point the Inner struct is referenced from both the thread (which is gonna store it in the threadlocal thread_info) and the parent (which returns it), it was much easier to add it to Thread than to Inner. It is a single u32 so I'm not sure the memory usage is an issue, but it is a little awkward to have id in Thread and name in Inner?\n\nLet me know.\n",
