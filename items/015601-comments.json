    "body": "@sfackler Personally I would love to see the `--pretty expanded` source work for as many programs as possible (ideally 100%). Any change that explicitly prevents that from being possible makes me sad.\n\nFWIW, the only feature I know of offhand that should be impossible to implement in `--pretty expanded` is the `#![!resolve_unexported]` attribute that the auto-generated test module uses, and that's because that attribute very intentionally is invalid to parse. That bugs me, but at least there I can delete the test module and pass the `--test` flag again and it should work. Aside from that one intentional breakage, everything else theoretically should work. On the matter of hygiene, that could perhaps be solved with a hygiene-preserving pass done to the expanded source that renames any identifiers that would be unhygienic if left alone (since they're always created by macros it's not a big deal if their names are mangled anyway).\n",
