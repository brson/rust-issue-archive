    "body": "I don't want to discourage benchmarking, but I don't think this captures the whole picture.  It is true that despite generating amazingly inefficient code for many generic functions we probably don't suffer that much because they mostly serve to glue other pieces together.  However, first, performance is not the only concern: correctness is another.  The current code for walking data structures dynamically is quite fragile and gets a number of cases wrong (alignment of enums being a prominent example).   This stuff can be fixed, but it's going to require a lot of effort.  \n\nSecond, I think monomorphizing is an enabler for a lot of other things, some of which will also improve performance:\n- specializing to a particular impl, which would allow inlining of method calls on interface-bounded generics;\n- stack maps for cycle collection, garbage collection, deferred reference counting, whatever become much more straightforward;\n- eliminate the indirection for all return values (which may in turn aid LLVM optimizations);\n- optimizing the representation of enums in particular cases (for example, to use a nullable ptr for option@T);\n- etc.\n",

More experimental data:\n- I set up librustc to include the vec module from core, and use its own version, so that we had more in-crate generic calls.\n- I compiled the result once without monomorphization and once with.\n- The monomorphized version works!\n- The binary is **10% bigger**.\n- It compiles things about **1% faster**.\n\nThis suggests that code blowup is not prohibitive, but definitely significant. There are still some tricks that can be used to reduce this.\n\nThe speedup is somewhat disappointing.
