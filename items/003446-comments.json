    "body": "I was going to ask, wouldn't that make it impossible to call one-shot functions inside of structs? But that wouldn't make any sense anyway - if you don't have some way to move the oneshot out of the struct (such as would be needed to call it under this agreement), then you have no way to consume the oneshot to begin with.\n\nI forget, did we decide that noncopyable closures were the same as oneshot closures, or not? If not, there might be that issue here.\n",
