    "body": "@aturon As a test I created the `Str([u8])` type [out of tree](https://github.com/japaric/dstr.rs) (see the [docs](http://japaric.github.io/dstr.rs/dstr/struct.Str.html)). I removed `StrPrelude` and replaced it with inherent methods on the `Str` type, moved the `from_utf8` free function into `Str`, and also checked that the doctests pass. The only issue that I found in the process was #19037 which already got fixed.\n\nAbout the implementation process, I guess these are the steps to take?\n- Add a `str` lang item for the string literals (`\"foo\"`)\n- Add the `str([u8])` struct, mark it with the `str` lang item, remove `StrPrelude`, add inherent methods\n- Remove the compiler support that glues the built-in `str` to string literals.\n- Remove the rest of the compiler support for the built-in `str` (like being specially treated as a DST?)\n\nI really hope that we would be able to split the work like that (although probably parts 2 and 3 will have to get done at the same time), otherwise it's going to be a big patch. Also, depending if we want to rename `str` to `Str` (since it would no longer be a built-in/primitive type), we may end up with a massive code churn and downstream breakage (probably not worth it).\n",
