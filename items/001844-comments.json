    "body": "This RFC stems from this StackOverflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9282805/rust-pattern-matching-over-a-vector\n\nPersonally, I think it would be really useful if `alt`s were able to reason about vectors in the manner shown in the first example here. Testing for an empty list using `[] { ... }` seems much more intuitive and concise than `x if x == [] { ... }`, and the `tail...` syntax (which feels familiar to [rest parameters](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:rest_parameters) in Harmony) seems to be somewhat analogous to the `...` in the macro-by-example syntax.\n",

    "body": "I kinda made up the syntax I was using, so feel free to change/modify/critique it as much as you guys want. I simply wrote it that way to express the idea.\n\nHaskell has a nice way of doing it by expressing the inverse of what you want, eg. a list is constructed from a number of cons (represented as an infix `:`) with a `[]` at the end. So: `[1, 2, 3] == 1:2:3:[]` and in the pattern matching syntax you can express the inverse operations you want applied to the structure. So, saying `x:xs` really means just undo that first cons. Which is ultimately nice because the syntax you use in the pattern matching is the same syntax you use in other places, just reversed.\n\nUltimately, these are all operations that could easily be defined with a few ifs and maybe a call to find the length of the vector, but using a pattern to express the concept feels more concise. \n",

As the thread's been inactive for a while, I'd like to make sure that the current consensus is still that it would be good to have this.\n\nBased on the original two examples, the above branch compiles the following:\n\n``` rust\nfn foldl<T, U: Copy>(\n    values: &[T],\n    initial: U,\n    function: &fn(partial: U, element: &T) -> U\n) -> U {\n    match values {\n        [head, tail...] => foldl(tail, function(initial, &head), function),\n        _ => copy initial\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    let y = foldl(x, 1, |a, b| a * *b);\n    io::println(fmt!(\"%d\", y));\n}\n```\n\nAnd the following:\n\n``` rust\nfn every_other_element<T: Copy>(\n    values: &[T]\n) -> ~[T] {\n    match values {\n        [head, _, tail...] => ~[head] + every_other_element(tail),\n        [head] => ~[head],\n        _ => ~[]\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\", \"abc\", \"def\"];\n    let y = every_other_element(x);\n    for y.each |s| {\n        io::println(fmt!(\"%s\", *s));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOne missing bit I'm still looking at is proper detection of exhaustiveness. As it is now, the following wouldn't compile:\n\n``` rust\nfn every_other_element<T: Copy>(\n    values: &[T]\n) -> ~[T] {\n    match values {\n        [head, _, tail...] => ~[head] + every_other_element(tail),\n        [head] => ~[head],\n        [] => ~[]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhich might lead to confusion.\n\nI'll submit a proper PR with tests if the community still agrees on the syntax.\n",
