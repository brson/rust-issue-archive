    "body": "#2800 was about changing `\\xXX` to mean utf8 code unit instead of unicode codepoint. I agree with the conclusion in that issue that that change is not a good idea since it isn't useful.\n\nBut this issue is separate; it's about removing `\\xXX` from the language entirely. `\\uXXXX` has to exist because it covers a larger range of values and means \"unicode codepoint\" in every language. `\\xXX` in Rust has no use because it's equivalent to `\\u00XX` _but_ causes confusion because `\\xXX` in C and C++ means raw byte hex.\n\nSo in aggregate it's _worse_ than useless, it's a net negative. _It addresses no use case_ and _provides no benefit_ but _comes with a cost_; the only thing it does successfully is confuse users coming from Rust's primary market, C & C++ developers.\n\nI honestly can't see why it's being kept.\n",

    "body": "I'm strongly in favor of a modified form of this, where we allow `\\xXX` for ASCII characters but disallow it for non-ASCII. This was [suggested](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/69#issuecomment-43002505) recently in rust-lang/rfcs#69, and apparently was also suggested back in #2800.\n\nKeeping `\\xXX` for codepoints U+0000 through U+007F seems like a good idea, because it means the same thing regardless of whether `\\xXX` is interpreted as a codepoint or a code unit, and it's a convenient syntax for referring to ASCII characters. But interpreting `\\x80-\\xFF` as unicode only serves to be confusing. And not just to C/C++ programmers; even though I've been using Rust for quite a while, the other day I caught myself using `\\x80` in a string and expecting to get the byte `0x80`.\n\nIf we restrict it to ASCII characters now, that also makes the behavior of the proposed byte string literals (rust-lang/rfcs#69) make more sense, where `\\x80` will definitely want to refer to the byte `0x80`.\n",
