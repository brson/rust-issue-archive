Because my umask was nonpermissive when I sudoed into root to install Rust my umask was orred with roots, and so Rust was installed with nonpermissive permissions (meaning I couldn't read from them as a normal user.) The problem was on my side, and I fixed it by changeing the sudo configuration to be more permissive by default.\n",
