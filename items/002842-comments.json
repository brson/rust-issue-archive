    "body": "It's true that it would be pretty simple to infer the bindings for type parameters in this case. But if you wrote a function with bounded type parameters (that is, \"T must have trait foo\"), it wouldn't be as straightforward (the typechecker would need to look at the whole function body, not just the signature). To keep type inference simple, we don't want to have to scrutinize the entire body to know the bounds for the type parameters. That is, if your function was:\n\n`fn bimap<K: Ord, V> (map: hashmap<K, V>) -> bimap<K, V>`\n\nthen the type signature by itself doesn't give you enough information to infer that `K` must have trait `Ord`.\n\nFor consistency, we require type parameter bindings for all type parameters, not just bounded ones.\n",

    "body": "In Rust, the rule is that \u2200 is always explicit. In type-theoretic notation, the type of `bimap` is\n\n```\n\u2200K,V.hashmap<K,V> \u2192 bimap<K,V>\n```\n\nConsider that if the \u2200 were in a different location, it wouldn't typecheck. The type above is distinct from this type:\n\n```\n(\u2200K,V.hashmap<K,V>) \u2192 (\u2200K,V.bimap<K,V>)\n```\n\nSo I think Rust's rules help clarity. And, as Tim mentioned, we need a place to put trait bounds.\n",
