    "body": "Its pretty hard to trace back from the ICE's that one gets to this cause.  E.g. messages like this (see #8286):\n\n``` rust\ntask 'rustc' failed at 'vtables missing where they are needed', \n   /Users/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/snap3-mac/build/src/libstd/option.rs:111\n```\n\ndo not tell the user that they should revise the code of their destructor.  (Admittedly, generic destructors are already unsafe ... but to me, `unsafe` does not imply \"may cause the compiler to ICE\" -- just the generated code!)\n\nWe should either figure out a way to allow generic destructors to invoke methods on `self`, or we should emit an error or warning earlier on in the compilation so that someone has a prayer of dissecting this problem without hunting through our issue database.\n\nNominating for 1.0, P-backcompat-lang.\n",
