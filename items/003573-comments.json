    "body": "They are intended to be lightweight enough to not require much thought about how lightweight they are, but currently there is a fair bit of overhead.\n\nMost of the overhead is in allocation and scheduler interaction. Rust tasks (in C++) are heap allocated and contain quite a few and I believe the total size of a task structure is in the high hundreds of bytes, then there are also Rust-side task state stored in task-local storage.\n\nThe biggest allocation cost for a task is the stack, and regardless of the crazy optimizations we do we will always have to allocate a new stack segment for each new task. Right now stack segments have a large, wasteful 'red zone' where Rust code does not run but various bits of other code do. The size of the initial stack segment on Linux is 2KB and on other platforms is a wasteful 20KB. There is a lot of opportunity for optimization here and I believe we should be able to get into the 1KB range (on Linux at least).\n\nThere are plans to lazily initialize tasks in the hopes that short-lived tasks can basically execute using their parents' resources, which, at the limit, will mean new tasks just need to allocate a stack segment to run on.\n\nI think we will get there eventually.\n\nAlso during the 0.4 development cycle there was a huge task spawning perf regression for as yet unknown reasons, but presumably that can be recovered.\n",

    "body": "@donbrowne Hi! I'm glad you are interested in working on this.\n\nYou should be aware that we are in the early stages of completely rewriting the Rust scheduler (#4419) so there is going to be a great deal of churn in this area this year. I'm also pretty intent on rewriting how linked task failure in Rust works to make it simpler. I want the built-in failure propagation to be more like Akka's task tree and less like Erlang's task groups (though I'm not intimately familiar with either). In generally I want the Rust core library to have the minimal capabilities necessary for external libraries to build on and experiment with different policies.\n\nIf you decide to go down this route it's going to be an adventure and it there could be a fair amount of yak shaving as Rust evolves.\n\nAs to actor libraries, I'm not well acquainted with existing ones, so it's going to be important to have experience with existing systems and to have an opinion about what they do right and wrong. From my perspective this project is about identifying traditional actor use cases and ensuring that Rust can support them. I would start with a survey of existing systems, identifying what the requirements are, and figuring out how Rust's features can be adapted and augmented to fulfill them. One major concern I have is that Rust is statically typed and the actor system's I'm aware of (Erlang, Scala, Akka) have dynamically typed messages. How can the actor model be adapted to static typing (fwiw Rust originally intended to have limited [dynamic typing](61) but so far there hasn't been a pressing need)?\n\nI'd also strongly recommend that as you solidify your plans that you share them on the mailing list. You may find people there who have better ideas on this topic than I. In the end this is a very open-ended project, particularly since it is an external library, so it will largely be up to you to set the goals and direction.\n",

    "body": "One other persistent concern I've had about Rust actors is that, in all actor systems I'm aware of, one can select from just a subset of all possible messages in the mailbox. If, in your current state, you aren't interested in receiving the `Quit` message, you can make the receive function ignore it and drop it back into the mail queue until you do want it. In Scala's library this is implemented with their first-class partial functions - which Rust doesn't have. I think this behavior is more or less what the original actor papers described as the `become` operation, where an actor takes on a different persona temporarily, but it's been a while since I read it.\n",
