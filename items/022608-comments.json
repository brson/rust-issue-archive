    "body": "So, it turns out that the default behavior of `getnameinfo` is to return the given IP address as a string when it can't resolve to a hostname. This seems undesirable to me. There's a flag `NI_NAMEREQD` that will cause it to return an error instead, but the value of this flag differs by platform.\n\nSo, I'm wondering whether I should accept the default behavior and document it or collect values of `NI_NAMEREQD` on all supported platforms. I have these so far:\n\n| Platform | Value | Source |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Linux | `8` | `/usr/include/netdb.h` on my system |\n| Windows | `4` | header provided by wine-dev |\n| Mac OS X | `4` | [here](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libinfo/Libinfo-406.17/lookup.subproj/netdb.h) |\n",
