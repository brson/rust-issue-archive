It can be used to further distinguish\nthe standard libraries if they must be installed next to each\nother.\n\nCloses #29559\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure if this solves a real problem. It's meant to help with side-by-side and overlapping installations where there are two sets of libs in /usr, but there are other potential issues there as well, including that some of our artifacts don't use this extra-filename munging, and it's not something our installers can support at all.\n\ncc @jauhien Do you still think this helps the Gentoo case? \n",
