  "body": "A bit-manipulation PR, however I still have some doubts:\n- Library. I believe this is a pretty core operation for several algorithms (eg. many checksums), is the \"battery-included\" philosophy ok for libstd?\n- Naming. Is `reflect()` too generic? That's how the operation is usually called, but may be too broad as API and conflict with reflection/introspection.\n- Lot's of redundancy here: 8, 16, 32 and 64 variants. I tried implementing it more generically, however:\n  - The `Bitwise` trait lacks `One`, `Zero` and `NumCast` for this implementation to work. Maybe they should be added anyway?\n  - Is it possible to split `impl Bitwise for i8..i64` in multiple files? Most of it is through instrinsics in each module, but ideally `reflect()` could be directly implemented in uint/int_macros abusing `$T`.\n\n---\n\nLet Bitwise provide a reflect() method for reversed binary\nrepresentation. This is a binary primitive used in several algorithms,\neg. CRC checksums.\n",
