    "body": "Doing it with a macro would require that the macro also define the enum, so that it knows the names and values, which I think would make for an ugly enum declaration. I would maybe prefer to use an attribute.\n\nThis could also be done with reflection and I think it should: `enum::from_int<T: CLikeEnum>(int) -> T`. Could be implemented in a number of ways. You would have to introduce a new compiler generated trait for c-like enums, or have dynamic failures if `T` isn't one.\n",
