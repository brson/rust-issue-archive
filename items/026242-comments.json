It is the case with the current algorithm (provided `use foo::Foo;` is made _before_ `use Foo as FooBar;`), but is no longer true with my change.\n\nTo make all tihs work, we'll need to make rustc declare imports as \"unresolved\" less quickly. I think I have an idea about that.\n",

    "body": "Okay, this is very troubling. I made this example, which has the same structure as the failing import of Hyper:\n\n``` rust\nmod bar {\n    pub use self::middle::*;\n\n    mod middle {\n        pub use self::baz::Baz;\n\n        mod baz {\n            pub enum Baz {\n                Baz1,\n                Baz2\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nmod foo {\n    use bar::Baz::{Baz1, Baz2};\n}\n```\n\nBut it fails on current nightly, while Hyper compiles...\n\nAnyway, overall the resolve algorithm seems to depend on the linear order of resolve (at several points, it decides that if the resolution is indeterminate, then the import _must_ be failed. My above example is an example of one of these cases.\n\nIf we want to change this, I'll certainly need more thought. Still, I don't give up yet.\n",

    "body": "The problem was that some other parts of the algorithm were doing some kind of a \"early return\", by marking a import as unresolved when it is in fact undeterminate. With the previous ordered approach it was completely valid, as these imports would never have been resolved anyway. It is no longer the case with my change, so I updated them to return `Undeterminate` instead, and rely on the main loop of `resolve_imports()` to stop us (which it does pretty well).\n\nThis patch successfully passes `make check-stage2-rpass`, and compiles successfully rand and hyper, which where the two root breakages crater found previously.\n",

    "body": "Okay, most of the breakage in the tests is due to several error message changing slightly, for example, both `Unresolved import `...`. There is no `..` in `..`.` and `Unresolved import `...`. Could not find `..` in `..`.` are merged into `Unresolved import `...`.`, which I don't think is a big problem.\n\nI'm a little more perplex about the `Maybe you meant foo::*` that appears regularly. Because if `use foo;` failed, there is no reason `use foo::*;` will not. So I'm slightly tempted to simply merge it into `Unresolved import`.\n\nOn the other hand, other error messages got merged into it, and we probably don't want to lose them: `Maybe a missing extern crate` and `Did you mean ... ?`. They can provide useful indications.\n\nAnd, last but not least, it appears my assumption about the invariant of the refcell `module.imports` was wrong : the test `use self::*;` causes an ICE because of a double borrow of a refcell. I'm not sure it's exactly this, but I'm looking into it.\n\nNow, I definitely see what you meant about resolve changes being subtle @alexcrichton :astonished:\n",
