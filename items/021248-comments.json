    "body": "> All unstable and deprecated features are named 'unnamed_feature', which i picked just because it is uniquely greppable. This is the 'catch-all' feature. What should it be?\n\nI think in general we want some categories of features:\n- All crates should have their own feature name. For example libcore should probably have a global feature called `core` or something like that (same for alloc, collections, ...). Everything related to the compiler can probably just be called `rustc` perhaps?\n- Within the standard library, huge modules (those you listed below like path, io, os, ...) should just have their module name as the feature (or some derivative).\n- Within the remaining unstable APIs, there are some that are still \"clearly separable\" from a catch-all such as `std::time`, `std::thread_local::scoped`, etc. These can probably use the same naming rules as io/os/path.\n- With everything else, _these_ should probably be in a catch-all for now.\n\nI'm not sure how aggressive we want to be right this red-hot-second about categorizing features into these buckets, but it does seem prudent to start earlier rather than later!\n\nFor a catch-all name though we may want to strive for something that conveys \"this is unstable, but we probably do not want this to be unstable, please tell us if you're using this\". I'm not sure if a name can actually convey that though... All I can really think of is `std_unstable` :(\n\n> All stable features are named 'grandfathered'. What should this be?\n\nSome other possibilities:\n- `1.0.0`\n- `rust-1.0.0`\n- `initial`\n- `stable`\n- `rust1`\n\nI suppose with the version in `since` we don't need to put the version in the feature name, but it also probably doesn't matter too much.\n",

    "body": "Does the comment about updating the RFC mean we will be reserving the \"nice\" names for this? I think that would be a mistake, since this system is unlikely to be useful outside of the standard distribution (or at least it hasn't been designed and considered for outside use).\n\nI also think that warning on unstable today is basically noise, since way too much is still unstable for most code to be reliably written with no use of unstable items. As a result, people have just been sticking `#![allow(unstable)]` at the top of all their crates, which vastly diminishes the use of the lint as we get closer to 1.0 beta and critical things are no longer unstable. We should leave the lint off for now, then turn it on when it is actually feasible to write most code with no use of unstable APIs.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I continue to be concerned about the disconnect between the behavior of deprecated and unstable/stable. I've identified one problem that i think is particularly ugly: as written anything that is marked deprecated can be used on the stable channel (and the RFC explicitly says that anything deprecated is also tagged stable), but i think there is a strong use case for deprecating unstable things as well. I'd like to suggest the following changes:\n- Every deprecated attribute must be paired with _either_ an unstable or stable tag. In effect every feature is either stable or unstable, but specific APIs may be deprecated. This I think is more inline with the continued use of `allow(deprecated)` for deprecated APIs.\n- The deprecated tag does not require a 'feature' label - I can't think of any purpose it serves and istr coming up with some strange scenarios involving labels changing that i can't remember off hand.\n",

I am still working on a test that it shuts off the stability warnings, and will hopefully have it tonight or tomorrow.\n- Rustdoc improvements. This can be done separately.\n",
