  "body": "This time we're not promoting anything directly to 'stable', but instead promoting functions we're happy with to 'unstable'. They'll become stable in another pass later.\n- null and mut_null are unstable. Their names may change if the unsafe\n  pointer types change.\n- copy_memory and copy_overlapping_memory are unstable. We think they\n  aren't going to change.\n- set_memory and zero_memory are experimental. Both the names and\n  the semantics are under question.\n- swap and replace are unstable and probably won't change.\n- read is unstable, probably won't change\n- read_and_zero is experimental. It's necessity is in doubt.\n- mem::overwrite is now called ptr::write to match read and is\n  unstable. mem::overwrite is now deprecated\n- array_each, array_each_with_len, buf_len, and position are\n  all deprecated because they use old style iteration and their\n  utility is generally under question.\n\nNote that `mem::overwrite`, which was just declared stable last week, is deprecated now in favor of `ptr::write`. Woo!\n",
