For example, you'd use this to create a place to work on some collection of rust packages like Servo. `rustpkg init` and then `rustpkg install github.com/mozilla/servo`\n2. A better name for something that created a package scaffolding is `rustpkg new PKGID` which would create just the package dir and not a workspace.\n3. Many other similar tools add a test as well, but this test is bad because it will start failing as soon as you make any change to the package. Whatever test is added to the scaffolding should always pass (or always fail I suppose depending on your point of view).\n",

    "body": "@huonw Thank you for the clarification. I tried it and it really didn't work.\n@metajack if this PR reverts to only creating a package directory, to the user, the amount of typing wouldn't be justified by the handicapped capability (`rustpkg new PKGID` versus `mkdir PKGID`). `test.rs` is added in order to encourage writing tests by means of examples. When the test fails because of modifications or by default, the user can always delete the file or comment out the test. Thus, by adding `test.rs`, we risk confusing the new user at first in exchange for better engineering practices in the community. This, I think, is worthwhile.\n",
