In this case, it is pretty difficult to tell what is being proposed because the module mixes stable and unstable features.\n\nI noticed that a large part of this module could work in `#![no_std]` mode. I suggest moving the `#![no_std]`-compatible parts to `core::net`, or at least consider how making it work with `#![no_std]` would affect the API.\n\nIt also seems odd that `Ipv4Addr` and `Ipv6Addr` have things like `is_multicast` and `is_global` but there's no trait that allows code to make these queries generically over those types of addresses. If such a trait were to bad added later, would the existence of these non-trait methods cause problems? If so, it might be worth considering building the trait first.\n",

I believe they fit this requirement already but would like to double-check.\n\n---\n\n@briansmith \n\n> I suggest moving the #![no_std]-compatible parts to core::net\n\nYeah these things can certainly move around over time (it's backwards compatible to move them at a later date). I'd be a little wary of putting things in core \"just because\" without a concrete purpose, and these kinda fall into the category I'd be wary of. For example the internal representation of each of these primitives is the `libc` equivalent (e.g. `libc::sockaddr_in6` or `libc::in_addr`) which unfortunately isn't available in libcore, so if we move it to core we'd have to invent our own storage format.\n\n> It also seems odd that Ipv4Addr and Ipv6Addr have things like is_multicast and is_global but there's no trait that allows code to make these queries generically over those types of addresses. If such a trait were to bad added later, would the existence of these non-trait methods cause problems?\n\nMethod resolution favors inherent methods (methods defined on the type itself) over trait methods (e.g. impl'd traits plus the trait being in scope), so in that sense we're covered to add a trait at a future date. That being said the standard library doesn't have too many traits like this for abstracting between one or two types, so I would personally want to hold off on this extension for now.\n\nA possible alternative, however, could be adding the common set of methods to `IpAddr` if we end up stabilizing that as well.\n",

[RFC 7371](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7371) also takes the opportunity to mention that the link-local /10 exists and then appears to discuss multicast without regard to whether or not it's a new chunk of the /10 or not.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is, although I agreed with your suggestion so much that I initially thought *I* had written it, I'm no longer so sure how to stand on this.",

    "body": "Regarding the `is_global` function applied to `ipv4` and `ipv6` addresses here, when looking at the IANA standard, I realized that there are several addresses considered as `Special-Purpose Address` which are not listed in the `std` `is_global` condition. Is this normal?\r\n\r\n- `ipv4` IANA list: https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml#note2\r\n- `ipv6` IANA list: https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that some of the addresses in the IANA table are considered `globally reachable`, it is notified at the beginning of the document:\r\n\r\n_Address prefixes listed in the Special-Purpose Address Registry are not guaranteed routability in any particular local or global context._\r\n\r\nSo in my view all addresses in the IANA table should be considered in the condition as not being `is_global`, is there something I've misunderstood here?\r\n\r\n",

table 1 you'll see some Rust/Python disagreement in the following ranges: `192.0.0.0/24`, `64:ff9b:1::/48`, `2001::/23`.\r\n\r\nYou'll also notice that starting with version 3.10 Python started to interpret IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses as their IPv4 counterparts for the purposes of evaluating `is_global` \u2013 it's not important to my message but I thought I'd mention it. I'm not particularly fond of that.\r\n\r\nI consider both Rust and Python implementations somewhat buggy, sometimes buggy in the same way (for example when it comes to the `2002::/16` range).\r\n\r\nIn table 2 we have Rust/Python/Go comparison where\r\n\r\n* Rust is patched with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/119006\r\n* Python is patched with https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113179\r\n\r\nWith the patches in place Rust and Python are in almost perfect agreement on the `is_global` front \u2013 the only exception is handling of the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. I believe it's a direction worth pursuing.\r\n\r\nWith the Rust patch the number of Rust/Go disagreements decreases by 1 (I think) but the nature of the disagreements changes (in both ways, it's roughly equalized).\r\n\r\nThe implementation I propose is consistent with what's proposed by @tcoratger above (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27709#issuecomment-1526091769).\r\n\r\nThe tables don't capture the difference in `is_unicast_global` behavior as `ipcheck` doesn't test that.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/tree/main/tools/ipcheck\r\n[2] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76098#issuecomment-760651861\r\n[3] https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/pull/317\r\n[4] https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/pull/318",
