    "body": "There are a few really important differences:\n- `Borrow` is used by data structures like `HashMap` and `BTreeMap` which assume that the result of hashing or ordering based on owned and borrowed values is the same. But there are many `AsRef` conversions for which this isn't true. So in general, `Borrow` should be implemented for fewer types than `AsRef`, because it makes stronger guarantees.\n- `Borrow` provides a blanket implementation `T: Borrow<T>`, which is _essential_ for making the above collections work well. `AsRef` provides a different blanket implementation, basically `&T: AsRef<U>` whenever `T: AsRef<U>`, which is important for APIs like `fs::open` that can use a simpler and more flexible signature as a result. You can't have both blanket implementations due to coherence, so each trait is making the choice that's appropriate for its use case.\n\nThis should be better documented, but there's definitely a reason that things are set up this way.\n\nAs to `AsRef` on `Box` and friends, the initial implementations were somewhat minimal, and we've been adding more over time.\n\nI'm going to close this issue for now, since the traits are not in fact redundant. But it may be worth opening a separate issue for improved documentation and missing `impl`s on `AsRef`.\n",

So would it not make sense to have the trait be `AsHashableRef` (or something similar) and method be `as_hashable_ref` or something similar? Hopefully some one else can come up with a shorter name that makes sense.~~ \r\n\r\n~~It is rather verbose - but it's intentions are much more clear. `Borrow` is just confusing in the context.~~\r\n\r\nPS: I could be wrong, but my brain is likely misleading me into thinking I have good understanding after reading the above statement, but I'm not entirely sure if I'm clear on the kind of consequences on implementing one over the other would cause.

    "body": "I'm a bit troubled by @aturon's comment about `Borrow` and `Hash` and `Ord`:\r\n\r\n>Borrow is used by data structures like HashMap and BTreeMap which assume that the result of hashing or ordering based on owned and borrowed values is the same.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to hear that types implementing `Borrow<T>` have to hash and be ordered the same way as `T`. I see now that it _is_ mentioned in the [documentation for `Borrow`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/borrow/trait.Borrow.html), but it seems like a restriction that is unrelated to the concept of borrowing data, and if `HashMap` and `BTreeMap` require those invariants, they should use separate marker traits for them.\r\n\r\nI realize it's not possible to add another trait bound to `HashMap` and `BTreeMap` at this point, and even if it was, it might not be desirable. It's just that this hurts the `Borrow` trait by making it less general, and seems prone to error by people like me who implement `Borrow` for their type without noticing that restriction in the documentation. The latter problem could be addressed by making the following sentence stand out more in the docs:\r\n\r\n>If you are implementing Borrow and both Self and Borrowed implement Hash, Eq, and/or Ord, they must produce the same result.\r\n\r\n",
