In the ten days since then, I believe I have in IRC\n> heard one positive opinion and on quite a few occasions (at least half a\n> dozen, which I would consider quite a large number) distinctly negative\n> opinions, some of things that at the time we thought that we could live\n> with but are discovering that, having given it time to sink in, it really\n> _is_ worse. At first glance, the changes may _look_ nicer (I don\u2019t know\u2014I\n> didn\u2019t find it so, overall), but we have lost a _lot_ of utility and\n> character in it.\n> \n> I want us to change our direction and mostly go back to the old styles.\n> \n> Here are my three main reasons for saying, \u201cThe old is good\u201d:\n> \n>    -\n> \n>    Things were separated into blocks that could be perceived\n>    individually, much more effectively. In some places this went a little too\n>    far, and I would be in favour of changing the main content\u2019s background\n>    from grey to a very light grey, but taking out _all_ blocks is\n>    significant hindrance to usability. The structure of all the content is\n>    very significantly important; being able to quickly navigate around.\n>    -\n> \n>    The old design had character. The bottom borders on things, the\n>    distinct colour scheme, the fonts\u2014they all _felt like Rust_. I draw\n>    particular attention to the blocky font used in the headings; that font was\n>    a very good font choice and fits in with the Rust name, logo (\n>    _especially_ the logo), &c. More changes to the new styles are being\n>    proposed, but the changes are still just feeling tacky and generic\u2014they\n>    don\u2019t feel like _Rust_.\n> \n>    Character is a surprisingly important thing, and at present we\u2019ve lost\n>    it. I think we should be looking rather at changing the styles of the\n>    non-rustdoc docs to make them _feel like Rust_. I hope you understand\n>    the abstract concept that I am getting at.\n>     -\n> \n>    Not only did the font choices have character, they were also easier to\n>    read the structure of the page from. This has also contributed to it being\n>    more difficult to read things.\n> \n> This is mostly separate from issues like the reduction of information\n> density (#13591 https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/13591)\u2014that can\n> be improved upon without going back to the old layout, though I rather\n> suspect that with the everywhere\u2010is\u2010white approach, usability will be\n> hindered further by more dense information. But I cannot reasonably hold\n> that as a point against the new design until it has been tried.\n> \n> I propose, then, that we revert almost all of the style changes. I would\n> still keep the lightening of the grey background in the main body area (\n> _not_ in the sidebar by any means), though I would prefer it not to be\n> taken quite to white\u2014rather, swap its background colour with that of the\n> code blocks, as they were back then. Not lessening anyone\u2019s contributions\n> to either design in any way, I believe that the earlier design was largely\n> more appropriate for Rust.\n> \n> No decision should be reached terribly rapidly on this matter; it would be\n> well to try to gauge what people _actually_ feel about the matter; it may\n> be that, given the threat to the new design, people will flock to support\n> it and it be revealed that I am actually incorrect. It is always hard to\n> judge such things.

    "body": "Disclaimer: I am obviously biased having done the initial version of the old design, and I haven't followed the discussion at all on the new one since I have been a bit out of touch with rust lately.\n\nBut yes, while I would say the new design is shinier, I don't think technical documentation has to be shiny, it has to be usable/readable, and I do feel the flattish design all white approach loses on that aspect. I think the old one was already kinda fancy when it comes to a documentation layout. \n\nIMO design time would be better spent on the http://www.rust-lang.org page which could use a more appealing first impression. As long as the critical links remain easy to find that is :)\n",

    "body": "I think the new style of docs is an immense improvement over the old style. The larger and more spacious font makes reading the docs much easier, and more pleasing. I disliked the previous blocky and tight header font, and the general text itself I found to be smaller than I would like. The new style is also more smart-phone friendly. The small lettering of the previous style required more futzing around with to be readable on a phone.\n\n(For reference, I generally use two 24in 1920 x 1200 monitors.)\n\nI found the gray and white backgrounds of the old scheme was slightly distracting compared to the new all white scheme. Colored words stand out much better now against the pure white background, than they did on the gray background. There was a tightness, a confined feeling, with the gray background that encapsulated the content and navigation pane, then being further encapsulated by the remainder of the page being white. \n\nAs for character, my personal image of Rust is primarily \"modern\" and \"practical\". I feel that the new doc style accomplishes that far better than the old style.\n",

    "body": "What @vky said ties into my personal feelings.\n\n> When the changes landed, feedback was definitely mixed.\n\nThe post got 81% upvotes (as of now), it's a pretty good score for a design change imo &ndash; design is _always_ controversial.\n\n> The old design had character.\n\nCan't say otherwise, but webfonts here (once they work properly... see issues referenced by @huonw) are giving uniqueness to it, minimalist and readable design too. Just look at the majority of today's websites, they have small point sizes for the body, they have colors and ads all over the place that [distract the user](http://pjrvs.com/a/reader/) from the actual content. Is you were writing a paper specification, would you put colors and fanciness all over the place? The web is no different to me. Designing a website focused on content is what makes it truly unique, and readable at the same time.  \nNow sure, I am not personally opposed to making some style tweaks. Fonts, code color scheme... this is what makes it truly unique imo, the rest is bloating.\n\nLike @huonw said, there are some issues with the fonts right now so most of you may not be able to see them. I am working on the fallout of the new design and on fixing this (through I don't exactly know how to make the server pickup and upload the fonts &ndash; my attempt in # seems like it wasn't successful &ndash; cc @brson).\n\nLastly, I will quote some of the principles I stand against behind the current design &ndash; even though the original work is @TheHydroImpulse's &ndash; from reddit:\n\n> The new design is content-centric, using the typical typography guidelines &ndash; a process similar to the one fleshed out by [the 1910 studio](http://blog.weare1910.com/post/75576312730/a-readable-wikipedia). This ties into the guidelines shown by [Matthew Butterick](http://practicaltypography.com/websites.html): a content-centric internet and it has nothing to do with Bootstrap specifically, it's just about doing away with default browser-styles and raising the font-size to have a proper view and better readability of content. Scrolling a bit more often is not an issue when you have a significantly more comfortable readability and less bloat.  \n> It is a minimalist and content-centric design, not a Bootstrap design. What's like Bootstrap: underline under the headings, the search bar highlights in blue when you click it.\n> \n> Having a higher point-size is crucial now that we the minimum common denominator in terms of screen is \"decent\". Please read [this article by SmashingMagazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/07/16-pixels-body-copy-anything-less-costly-mistake/) that goes more into technical details with this matter, also most importantly [this article about responsive typography](http://ia.net/blog/responsive-typography-the-basics/) which is very comprehensive about point size, margins and how it should be set.  \n> No typographer, no designer will tell you otherwise and you'll see yourself having less trouble to concentrate and less squint when reading a text that has appropriate point size (16px and higher) and proper, aerated but not exaggerated line-height (120-145% &ndash; of prime importance for readibility and when jumping to the next line of text).\n\nThat's the gist of it&mdash;now of course I am committed to making the \u201cbest and most-efficient\u201d content for everyone and not just me so I will let @brson voice out what he thinks is wise.\n",

    "body": "I'm currently using a retina macbook pro, and quite enjoy having bigger fonts. I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to typography and the old design didn't have a good focus on typography. Though I still think the typography needs some work; however, I'm worried that it will become a design by committee, which doesn't end well &mdash; at all. In the end, design is somewhat subjective. However, I think there's a good standard that many people have agreed is good design (web design specifically).\n\nHere are some links I've collected that demonstrate some strong typography:\n- http://kvz.io/blog/2009/05/25/install-the-best-coding-font/\n- http://blog.sourcing.io/structuring-sinatra\n- http://wouterdebr.es/ (This one is especially good looking)\n- https://zapier.com/learn/apis/chapter-2-protocols/\n- https://bugsnag.com/blog/responsive-typography-with-modular-scale\n- http://agis.io/2014/03/25/contiguous-stacks-in-go.html\n- https://www.routific.com/developers# (This isn't so much typography, but a clean documentation example)\n- http://michaelrbernste.in/2014/04/16/lisp-is-abstract-syntax.html (Not sure about the highlighting for the links though)\n- https://blog.rainforestqa.com/2014-04-23-why-unit-integration-and-qa-testing/\n\nI think there needs to be some changes to the current font size. The space isn't used effectively IMO.\n\n---\n\nThe biggest thing right now is \"what's the goal/vision?\" I find the best designs have a singular goal/vision from the get go. The issue with providing tweaks here and there is that the vision gets lost and nothing becomes clear on what the _goal_ truly is.\n\nFor example, if we set out with the goal of being extremely comfortable to read and look at (i.e., you _want_ and _love_ to look at it. It _clear_, it makes _sense_), then we might get to an entirely different design.\n\nHopefully we won't get lost along the way and it doesn't become a mess of inconsistencies and \"tweaks\" everywhere. \n",

    "body": "I'm using a 1280x800 px laptop screen right now. I also believe the fonts are way too big.\nThe current theme looks nice, but I honestly think the bulk of text looks better (and is easier to read) in Helvetica Neue than in Heuristica. After all, Helvetica and its derivatives are well tested and familiar fonts. Also, Heuristica is a serif font. Although great for printing, serif fonts are (arguably) harder and less pleasing to read on computer screens, compared to sans-serif.\n\nObviously opinions will differ on what to \"tweak\" or not. I agree with @TheHydroImpulse. We need to know where we are going. And we need a lot of opinions.\n\nI'm personally going to play with the css on a copy of the docs that ship with Rust for the next hour or so, and compare it to other documentation styles I like.\n",

    "body": "> Although great for printing, serif fonts are (arguably) harder and less pleasing to read on computer screens, compared to sans-serif.\n\nNo, as long as you have 12pt or higher point size. The serifs' horizontal geometry help guiding lecture.\n\nThey have been historically left out because early computer screens had really bad resolutions so it was easier to use no-frills, sans-serif fonts. Common domestic printer resolution today is 600dpi, as long as you approach 100 dpi the serifs have their turn.\n\nSee [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/body-text.html), [Responsive Typography](http://ia.net/blog/responsive-typography-the-basics/) and [A Reader-first Internet](http://pjrvs.com/a/reader/).  \n[The Shape of Design](http://shapeofdesignbook.com/) is another web book example. For a more relevant example to our matter, [Racket docs](http://doc.racket-lang.org/) use a serif typeface.\n\nThough I have to agree that `rustdoc` is different since it's _code documentation_, not raw documentation itself. It's often shorter and meant for a quick glance (?) so I introduced some changes as part of #13776:\n- Changed font-size from 18px to 15px\n- Reintroduced gray background for code samples\n- Tightened up the margins\n\nI updated my cached copy with these changes, e.g. here is [struct.CChars](http://adrientetar.legtux.org/cached/rust-docs/struct.CChars.htm).\n",

    "body": "> The old design had character. The bottom borders on things, the distinct colour scheme, the fonts\u2014they all felt like Rust. I draw particular attention to the blocky font used in the headings; that font was a very good font choice and fits in with the Rust name, logo (especially the logo), &c. More changes to the new styles are being proposed, but the changes are still just feeling tacky and generic\u2014they don\u2019t feel like Rust.\n\nThere's a fine balance between striking a rust look and an appropriate design for 2014. The thing is is that the old design certainly didn't feel like 2014.\n\nI also disagree with the previous massively bold fonts. It wasn't a page where I wanted to look at. I believe that's what documentation should be. You want to use it because it makes sense, the old design certainly didn't have that feel.\n\nTake a look at the Julia docs (although not an API documentation) http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.2/manual/introduction/.\n\nYou can easily identify their goals:\n- Content is the #1 goal. You should be able to see the content extremely easily.\n- The breadcrumbs are out of the way. They are up top so that people can see and use them, but they're not in the content.\n- The sidebar is super light. No need for cluttering your vision because content is the focus. They don't make an emphasis on search, but search is still there and is useful.\n- The overall page is easy to take in. It's nice and white, standard page that doesn't need to be unique. That's not the goal of their doc site.\n\nI don't think there's any vision for the current Rust docs. And I think that'll hurt.\n\nI don't think the current design is done, because it still needs a lot of work. But I do think it's better than before (especially once the bugs are fixed &mdash; which I haven't experienced.)\n",

    "body": "I don't have a lot to say here.\n\nFirstly, @adrientetar and @TheHydroImpulse are doing a fantastic job making progress while balancing all the different opinions. It looks like this thread is progressing well, with feedback about what's not working with the current design informing future work. Thank you for keeping it civil.\n\nSecond, the biggest win in the recent redesigns is that it makes the styles of our different HTML assets similar, so now when you navigate between rust-lang.org, the standalone docs, and rustdocs, they don't all look completely different. It's not perfect yet, but it's better.\n\nKeep moving forward.\n",
