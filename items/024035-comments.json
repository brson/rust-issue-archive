    "body": "Oh wow, thanks for taking the initiative here! Also thanks for the quite comprehensive tests!\n\nI think that the Windows implementation here may need some more work, however. We're trying to move away from the use of file descriptors as much as possible and currently `Stdio::piped` is the last holdout before we're able to remove them entirely. The current representation of a `File` on Windows as simple a `libc::HANDLE` is actually quite intentional, and it's fairly crucial that we keep it that way.\n\nWould you be interested in investigating removing the usage of file descriptors on Windows here? I'd be willing to help out of course!\n",
