    "body": "Looks like the problem is `reset()` calls `unwrap()` directly on the results of looking up `op`, which dumb doesn't support. This used to work because it used to only do this if `color_supported`, but with the removal of that boolean, it always tries to emit the `op` code.\n\nThis was a problem before, if you could find a terminfo that defined `setaf`, `setab`, and had `colors` >= 16, but did not define `op`.\n",
