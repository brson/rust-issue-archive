    "body": "I agree that we shouldn't really be diverging from what standard tools like gcc are doing, but I'd like to at least see a test or two when dealing with this. I would also like to try to fix this at the source because anyone inspecting a `Span` would have to remember that the line numbers start from 1, but the column numbers start from 0. It'd be much nicer if everything either started from 0 or started from 1, and for ease of display it sounds like everything should start from 1.\n",
