    "body": "Hmm, I think this PR deserves a bit of thought. First, I've never been happy with the `wf` code, and this PR makes me less happy. It seems like we should be adding the knowledge that (e.g.) `(A,B)` requires that `A:Sized` and `B:Sized` into `implicator.rs`, not `wf.rs`, but honestly I have to re-read the code to remember how they interact (and I suspect there is overlap and they should be simplified).\n\nSecond, I do think we should consider just when/where to enforce WF and trait requirements (and where to infer region relationships). The current policy is that we enforce all WF/trait requirements \"everywhere\" except that it is haphazardly enforced; but it's not totally clear to me that this is the best policy. Certainly the changes here seem ergonomically costly. I have to mull this a bit to form my opinion. (Note that enforcing WF in struct definitions, for example, was done deliberately in order to allow us to obviate things like `T:'a` from appearing on lots of fns.) \n\nIn any case, certainly this change is breaking enough that we would want to start considering the steps and mitigation measures from (pending) RFC rust-lang/rfcs#1122.\n\ncc @rust-lang/lang\n",
