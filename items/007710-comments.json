    "body": "> ...and I think names like block_metadata and file_metadata would be descriptive of their purpose.\n\nYeah, I definitely went for verbosity in the naming style. This was certainly influenced by my recent experiences of having to try to understand this code without much prior knowledge or documentation. My thinking behind this was that one should be able to get some insight into what's going on by just reading part of the code, because often a newcomer (or someone doing a quick fix in some code otherwise not known to them) will not be aware of the internal workings of these functions (such as that LLVM will merge duplicate metadata anyway and it is thus no semantic difference whether caching happens or not). \n\nIf you find this exceedingly ugly, we can change it of course. But otherwise I would still vote for some redundancy in the naming if it improves readability (even if it impedes writeability a bit).\n\nThat being said, I'm not completely satisfied with the naming in the module either. Maybe your approach with just `file_metadata` (with neither `create_` nor `get_or_create_` prefix) _plus_ some good documentation in the form of comments would be the best solution.\n",

    "body": "Wow. This is a _fantastic_ pull request, and I love how thorough your tests are. I stand by my earlier request with regards to the naming; I believe that whether a metadata function caches or not is of no interest to a user of the method, and documenting its behaviour via comments will be enough. With regard to my request to move unsafe blocks to their own lines, your snippet illustrates my desire correctly.\n",
