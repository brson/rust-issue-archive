    "body": "Why eschew Cargo? It's **the** tool for compiling crates. CMake doesn't have Rust support so far AFAIK, and if it ever gets Rust support it can't possible get _better_ at it than Cargo. Besides, it's not exactly an extra dependency, since Cargo is part of any Rust installation that is worth being called such.\n\nNow, there are parts to the build system that are outside the domain of Cargo (for example, the entire configure script, and the whole bootstrapping orchestration). Currently those are written in shell scripts and makefiles, and they could conceivably be written in CMake. On the other hand, those operations aren't directly supported by CMake either, i.e., would need lots of custom actions in yet another weird domain-specific language that would perhaps still require external tools (e.g. for downloading stuff). Therefore I am doubtful whether this is the nicest route and whether it will completely eliminate the mingw dependency.\n",

It won't do literally everything that's supported right now, but it should be a big step forward! As part of this transition I'll be moving our LLVM build to cmake (as well as compiler-rt on all platforms), and otherwise I agree with others that are pretty unlikely to rewrite our _entire_ build system in cmake.\n\nAs a result, I'm gonna close this for now as there's not a whole lot actionable. Changing our LLVM build to use cmake will happen naturally as we update it and otherwise we're going to rewrite things in Rust/Cargo rather than CMake instead of makefiles. \n\nThanks for the report though!\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton: Has the use of a custom package manager been publicly justified, and where might I find that justification?\r\n\r\nI am reluctant to use crates because in my experience all new languages have had poor track records with customized package managers. They are not as secure or as feature-rich as existing solutions, though they immediately achieve better language integration.\r\n\r\nIn some cases there are glaring security issues. In the case of Haskell's Cabal, code was downloaded insecurely (over HTTP) and run as root, and packages were not checked for authenticity. Can a case be made for the security of Cargo? How does Cargo's security compare to e.g. Gentoo's Portage?",
