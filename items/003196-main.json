  "body": "follow-up from #3187\n\nIt is now tested with Marmalade and I will also submit the recipes to melpa once its pushed here since I need to reference a repo/path from it.\n\nI also took the liberty to update the readme with some instructions since the cm-mode dependency requires some trickery with `advices` so that rust-mode.el knows where to find cm-mode when compiling.\n\nI pushed both packages on Marmalade, you can see them here http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/rust-mode http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/cm-mode, I will need to transfer ownership or at least add another more official owner at some point I guess.\n\nI also added Mozilla in the Authors meta data, let me know if that needs to be changed.\n\nNote: This push request includes the commits you rebased already.\n",
