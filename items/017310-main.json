  "body": "Generalize lifetime bounds on type parameters to support multiple lifetime bounds.\nThis doesn't really cause any difficulties, because\nwe already had to accommodate the fact that multiple implicit bounds\ncould accumulate. Object types still require precisely one lifetime\nbound. This is a pre-step towards generalized where clauses (once you\nhave lifetime bounds in where clauses, it is harder to restrict them\nto exactly one).\n\nStrictly speaking, this modifies RFC 49, hence: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/242\n\nr? @pcwalton \n",
