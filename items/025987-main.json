  "body": "Fix the dropck doc formatting to avoid hitting four-space indent.\n\nThis was causing `rustdoc` to interpret the part starting with `(A.) ...` as a code block based on its four-space indentation, which then was treated by `rustdoc` as a _Rust_ code snippet, and thus was attempting (and failing) to parse my english as Rust code. Thus causing the compiler-docs build to fail.\n\nIndependently, we should probably change `rustdoc` to not interpret four-space indents as code that needs to be tested; it seems too perilous to me at least.\n\n(But the formatting here needed to be changed either way.)\n\ncc Issue #25699.\n",
