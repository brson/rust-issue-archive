  "body": "This commit removes the in-tree copies of lib{term,rustc_serialize,getopts} in favor of the upstream versions in the rust-lang github organization. The purpose of this is to both reduce duplication of code as well as enabling easier addition of external dependencies into the build of the compiler itself. There are a few points of note here:\n- All external crates have been moved into a new `src/external` folder. This folder has a README explaining the git subtree setup as well as how to add new crates and update existing ones.\n- External crates are still compiled as unstable (e.g. not accessible from stable code) via the `#![staged_api]` attribute guarded by the `rust_build` cfg.\n- The API of getopts changed quite radically from the in-tree version, and all consumers were updated accordingly\n- The name `serialize` has been purged as all crates now just explicitly link to `rustc_serialize`.\n\ncc [the initial discussion thread](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/submodules-in-rust-lang-rust-for-external-repositories/2200) about this topic.\n",
