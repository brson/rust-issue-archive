In the current git version, a `~` is needed (if you read further on in the tutorial, it discusses the distinction between `~` values---which cannot be aliased and can be sent between tasks---and `@` values, which are local to a specific task but can be aliased freely).\n",

Right now it seems to indicate that version 0.3.x should be used, since the [Installation Section](http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#installation) uses `wget` to retrieve the 0.3 tarball and the \"badge\" at the bottom-right of the documentation window mentions Rust 0.3.1. Should I file a separate issue for that?\n",
