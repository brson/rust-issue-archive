    "body": "This was part of the shadowing RFC. The benefits are that order of imports are irrelevant, and you don't get weird at-a-distance effects of removing names from a module where that name is hidden. The current policy is for there to be no shadowing at all of any imports, and I think any change to that would need an RFC.\n\nTo answer the original question, globs are useful more than just in isolation, but only if there are no duplicate names. If there are duplicate names, then the importer should probably be forced to think about that.\n\nI have a half-finished tool to help with this kind of thing, but progress is slow because of 1.0 priorities.\n\nClosing this issue for now. If anyone thinks this could be improved somehow, you should open an issue on the RFCs repo. (I'm assuming any change would admit more code and therefore would be backwards compatible)\n",
