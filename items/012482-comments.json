    "body": "...and I just realized that `takes_ref_vec( [1, 2, 3].iter().map( |&x| x ).collect() )` can be rewritten as `takes_ref_vec( [1, 2, 3].iter().map( |&x| x ).to_owned_vec() )` and that works. Similar for the first example.\n\nOk, so my examples are crap, but (I think) my point still stands.\n",
