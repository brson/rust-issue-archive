Unlike internally-hosted bug trackers, Github accounts are ubiquitous.\n\nIts pretty subjective of course, but I think Github's issue tracker is more pleasant to use (for my purposes as very occasional contributor, so YMMV) than bugzilla. The only other system I have used much is Jira, which I would rate higher than bugzilla but lower than github.\n",
