I think the ultimate goal of qquote is to directly create the AST node rather than doing any sort of runtime substitution.\n\nNevertheless, I took a brief look at what it would take to support antiquotes in the identifier position, and yes, I'm afraid it would be very invasive as it will likely require changing the `str` type to an `enum`.  So, maybe arbitrary string substitutions is the best way to go, at least for now.\n\n@graydon, your thoughts?\n",

This would require also \nthreading this type parameter through the parser as well, which would \nthen be configured with a helper function that can produce Ids of the \nappropriate type.  It'd be something of a pain.  But the end result \nwould be that we can have AST nodes where identifiers are strings, which \nthe existing code wants, and AST nodes where identifiers have different \ntypes.  I love this kind of type-level hackery, but I fear to make it \neasy to do would require some language-level features we don't have.\n",
