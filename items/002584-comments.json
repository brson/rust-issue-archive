There are at least two possible easy workarounds, though: change move_val not to take an lval_result (it doesn't actually use the bcx field in its lval_result argument), and just take the kind and val as separate arguments; or make move_val's block argument pass-by-copy. I'm implementing one of these. Or if you get impatient, @eholk , you should be able to do the same in your local branch :-)\n",
