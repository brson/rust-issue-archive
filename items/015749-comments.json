    "body": "Changing the example is a good thing. However, there really should be a warning note to explain the restrictions that exist on this method. Here is my proposition:\n\n> Beware that this method is _not_ a general purpose `find` implementation. It exists only as a mean to optimize a call to the regular `find` method, by allowing the caller to avoid performing a type conversion if it is not necessary. This method cannot be used to provide an alternative ordering logic (for example, searching a String key case-insensitively).\n\nI'm not a native english speaker, so anyone feel free to correct it.\n",
