    "body": "> Obviously Rc, which is supposed to be the replacement for '@' doesn't work because you'd need another pointer inside it anyway.\n\n`Rc<~Trait>` is a substitute that should work for many instances of shared ownership trait-objects. (Except for the extra indirection, and some `size_of` details, this will behave almost exactly like `Rc<Trait>`.)\n\nIn any case, this is something that will hopefully come out of the \"dynamically sized types\" proposals (or similar; https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6308) and/or the smart pointer work (probably both).\n\n(Also, if you really need it, `@` and `@Trait` objects still exist, you can add `#[feature(managed_boxes)];` at the top of your crate file (NB. the semicolon is required)... If anyone asks, I didn't tell you this. ;) )\n",
