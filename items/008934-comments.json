It seems like you would never actually need to have `MemReader`, and if we did it looks like it should be implemented on top of `BufReader`.\n\nThat being said, even with both `MemWriter` and `BufWriter`, I'm not entirely sure why one would want `BufWriter`...\n\nAnyway, I'm curious what @brson has to say about the status of these apis. It seems to me that `MemReader` shouldn't exist, and perhaps one of the writers also shouldn't exist...\n",

    "body": "Since `MemReader` owns its buffer it can be passed around a lot more easily than `BufReader`. I'd like to implement `MemReader` in terms of `BufReader` but it's not clear to me that it's possible. I don't think an arrangement like\n\n``` rust\nstruct MemReader<'self> {\n    buf: ~[u8],\n    reader: MemReader<'self>\n}\n```\n\nis possible since it can't (I think) be constructed such that the lifetimes work out. After construction, it couldn't be moved. We could use a macro to create the implementations.\n\nI agree that `BufWriter` seems useless.\n\nThe other weird thing in here is that everything implements `Seek` but the `seek` impl fails. Would it make sense to split `Seek` in to separate `Seek` and `Tell` traits?\n",

Regardless, it looks to be that the code is very similar between `MemReader` and `BufReader`, so could they be implemented in a helper method taking a `&[u8]`?\n\nI don't really see why we can't implement seek on these buffers.
