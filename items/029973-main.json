  "body": "Some notes:\nThis patch enforces the rules from [RFC 136](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0136-no-privates-in-public.md) and makes \"private in public\" a module-level concept and not crate-level. Only `pub` annotations are used by the new algorithm, crate-level exported node set produced by `EmbargoVisitor` is not used. The error messages are tweaked accordingly and don't use the word \"exported\" to avoid confusing people (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29668).\n\nThe old algorithm tried to be extra smart with impls, but it mostly led to unpredictable behavior and bugs like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28325.\nThe new algorithm tries to be as simple as possible - an impl is considered public iff its type is public and its trait is public (if presents).\nA type or trait is considered public if all its components are public, [complications](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/limits-of-type-inference-smartness/2919) with private types leaking to other crates/modules through trait impls and type inference are deliberately ignored so far.\n\nThe new algorithm is not recursive and uses the nice new facility `Crate::visit_all_items`!\n\nObsolete pre-1.0 feature `visible_private_types` is removed.\n\nThis is a [breaking-change].\nThe two main vectors of breakage are type aliases (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28450) and impls (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28325).\nI need some statistics from a crater run (cc @alexcrichton) to decide on the breakage mitigation strategy.\nUPDATE: All the new errors are reported as warnings controlled by a lint `private_in_public` and lint group `future_incompatible`, but the intent is to make them hard errors eventually.\n\nCloses https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28325\nCloses https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28450\nCloses https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29524\nCloses https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29627\nCloses https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29668\nCloses https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/30055\n\nr? @nikomatsakis \n",
