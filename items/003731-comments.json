    "body": "@catamorphism is your thinking here that we would automatically include the contents of `demo.rs` into another file that applies some functions from librustdoc to the included text, just to ensure that nothing hangs/segfaults?  Or was there some strategy for checking that the documentation output conforms to some expected value?\n\n(I'm in part trying to understand why `include_str` was the missing piece of the puzzle ... the kinds of tests I was imagining seem like they would work with files just as well as with included-strings.\n\n(I know you didn't write the original comment, so if you don't have an idea of what the intention was, feel free to say so.  :)\n",
