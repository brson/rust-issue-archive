    "body": "@thestinger It's useful for custom user-defined data structures.\n\nI wish there was a hybrid reflection, which would use `Show` for types that implement it and `Poly` for types that don't, but there's no way to make this work for collections without implementing the hybrid directly for them (because collections implement `Show` in terms of their elements, which must implement `Show` as well, but what I really want is to be able to print a vector of non-`Show`-able objects).\n\nI don't suppose it would be possible to have a macro `impl_debug_show!(MyType)` that implements `Show` by returning the output of `Poly`, and having a lint be able to find invocations of that? This would require the lint being able to see through generic implementations of `Show::fmt()` and tell that they're calling a concrete implementation that's been flagged as a debug show, and I don't know if lints have that capability.\n\nThe idea here is that I could do something like\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo {\n    a: int,\n    b: ~str\n}\nimpl_debug_show!(Foo)\n\nfn foos() -> ~[Foo] {\n    ~[Foo { a: 3, b: ~\"test\" }, Foo { a: 4, b: ~\"hello\" }]\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = foos();\n    println!(\"{}\", x);\n}\n```\n\nand get something like\n\n```\n[Foo { a: 3, b: ~\"test\" }, Foo { a: 4, b: ~\"hello\" }]\n```\n\nprinted out, along with a lint warning during compilation pointing at the `println!()` call informing me that I'm relying on a debug Show.\n",
