  "body": "Resubmitting https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/4091 as I cannot seem to be able to change the target branch in the original PR. I squashed the commits as there isn't much of a logical separation possible and some of them were in half-broken state.\n\nIt'd be great if we could get this in for 0.5 if it's not too late. I'm stil considering @erickt's [a, ..b, c] proposal and wonder what other people think? As we're rejecting that syntax now, we can still be forward compatible with just the [a, ..tail] variant, though, so this could be added later on.\n",
