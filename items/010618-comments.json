    "body": "I was looking into #5900 and this looks like a somewhat similar problem.  The issue is that middle::const_eval::eval_const_expr_partial's ExprCast arm, which gets hit as a part of the call to check_item (here, specifically, check_fn), wants the ExprCast's parent id to already be in the type context but nothing has put it there yet.  In #5900 this is because the enum doesn't get checked before the struct; here, it doesn't look like its order dependent, there's just nothing pushing that expression into the context. \n",
