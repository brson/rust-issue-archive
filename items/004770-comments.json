    "body": "@graydon I'm still not sure that it is needed, though it probably is desirable. Even in 1:1 mode you would still be operating within a task, just one that has the entire thread to itself, so this wouldn't apply. Where this is still potentially useful is for communicating between tasks and non-tasks, and possibly for communicating between schedulers themselves.\n\nI only have one case currently where it is important for schedulers to send messages between each other and that is when one scheduler needs to schedule a task that is pinned to some other scheduler. We may end up wanting a special message queue tailored just to schedulers, and integrating with the event loop, for this purpose though.\n",
