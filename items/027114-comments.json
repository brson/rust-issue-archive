    "body": "I've understood the code well enough to see the problem, but not enough to\r\npropose a concrete solution. Could someone give me some pointers on\r\na reasonable path forward?\r\n\r\n- When [process_predicates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ba11640/src/librustc/traits/fulfill.rs#L433) sees the call site,\r\n   it registers a `RegionObligation` for that callsite's region to outlive the\r\n   static region `ReStatic`. This loses most of the information about the\r\n   cause. I think the only trace is in the `ObligationCause`s\r\n   `ObligationCauseCode` (a `DefId` which perhaps you could use later to get\r\n   a hold of the higher-kinded predicate), which is not very immediate.\r\n- when the region checker [visits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ba11640/src/librustc_typeck/check/regionck.rs#L349-L355)\r\n   this obligation, it turns it into the requirement that the `&i32` outlives\r\n   (i.e. is) `'static`. It turns the `ObligationCause` into a `SubregionOrigin`\r\n   (via `code_to_origin`), and this only keeps the `Span` from the original\r\n   cause (it seems impossible to emit an error message which is aware of the\r\n   circumstances at this point).\r\n- eventually, [collect_errors](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ba11640/src/librustc/infer/region_inference/mod.rs#L1148-L1158)\r\n   checks whether our region is a super-region of `ReStatic` (via\r\n   a `RelateParamBound` to which the matter has in the meantime resolved),\r\n   which it isn't, and emits a `RegionResolutionError` to that effect.\r\n\r\nWhat seems clear is that while terminating the higher-kinded predicate as\r\na `ReStatic` is convenient, it makes it impossible to give a better error\r\nmessage when the callsite's lifetime isn't `'static` later. OTOH, there are\r\nprobably good reasons for not leaking the higher type higher up (I read up on\r\nhow they are type checked, but I wouldn't say I understand too well in which\r\norder things happen).\r\n\r\nOne could try to plumb more information up along with the introduced `ReStatic`\r\n(i.e. adding to the `ObligationCause` information on what causes the `ReStatic`\r\nbound, which would presumably have to make it into the `SubregionOrigin` as\r\nwell, and then be used for constructing the user-visible error. But that also\r\nseems like a bunch of plumbing very specific to this very specific situation\r\n(even trying to find documentation on HRTBs, I only found the source code and\r\na blurb in the [nomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/hrtb.html)) and more\r\nof a hack than a fix.",

    "body": "@eddyb I think I know how to go about the second part (making a special `SubregionOrigin` that holds enough info to emit a better error) but I'm less sure about the first part.\r\n\r\nLet me see if I understand you correctly - you're proposing adding *something* to `ObligationCause` (not `RegionObligation` directly), right? That would then get passed down to [code_to_origin](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ba11640/src/librustc_typeck/check/regionck.rs#L349-L355) and allow me to do the second part.\r\n\r\nWhatever I pass down would have to hold the information that we synthesized a `'static` bound, and also the `Span` of the higher-ranked bound (i.e. something representing some part of `fn foo<T>() where for<'a> T: 'a {}`).\r\n\r\nSo perhaps a new `ObligationCauseCode`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub enum ObligationCauseCode<'tcx> {\r\n    ///  An obligation incurred from treating a higher-ranked trait situated at the specified Span.\r\n    HigherRankedRegion(Span) // do we need to keep a nested ObligationCauseCode here?\r\n}\r\n// code_to_error can now check the ObligationCauseCode if it sees a `ReStatic` bound\r\n// and emit a custom error with both the obligation's Span (`&'b i32`) as well as the HRTB (`for<'a> T: 'a {}`).\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming that that's reasonable (may well not be), one very practical question I have is how to get the `Span` from the predicate (or anything contained within) in `register_region_obligation` (or higher up?). I do have a `DefId` somewhere in the binder; is that how it's done? If so, appreciate a pointer on the magical incantation.",
