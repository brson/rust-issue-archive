For example, if the key value in a hash map is `Box<T>` then I should be able to query with `&T` instead of just `&Box<T>`.\n\nI know that @aturon has been working on solutions to this problem with multidispatch and some other RFCs he's got cooking, and I'm curious what his opinion on this is here.\n",

    "body": "This is a clever idea, and may be worth providing even if we deal with `_equiv` in some other way.\n\nFor reference, the current proposal for dealing with `_equiv` methods is in the [associated items RFC](https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/associated-items/active/0000-associated-items.md#defaults). Essentially, the proposal is to allow each (owned) key type to provide an associated \"query\" type. A typical use case is `String` with associated query type `str`, but for non-sliceable types you'd have the owned and query types be the same. The benefit is that there's just a single API surface (no `_equiv` methods) with a pretty straightforward signature. It also means that you can write:\n\n``` rust\n// map: HashMap<String, T>\nmap.find(\"some static string\")\n```\n\nrather than \n\n``` rust\nmap.find(\"some static string\".as_string())\n```\n",

Your key type is the tuple `(String, Option<String>)`, and this only allows you to go from `&str` to `String`, not from `(&str, Option<&str>)` to `(String, Option<String>)`. You could probably write a similar wrapper to achieve it though. That said, I think @aturon's proposed approach also handles your case, and in a rather simpler way: but you would probably have to newtype your tuple.\n",
