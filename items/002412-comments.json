    "body": "I've added support for the RUSTFLAGS environment variable, which at least allows building the tests with `--gc`. We still need to be able to xfail tests specifically for GC and probably also need to be able to build core and std with and without GC.\n\nFor building the libraries we may be able to just always pass the `--gc` flag to generate stack maps. As long as the runtime doesn't do anything with the stap maps it might not interfere with anything.\n",
