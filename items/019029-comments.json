    "body": "@vberger Thanks for the PR!\n\nIt seems to me that we just shouldn't apply _any_ stability level to these internal items, since stability is wholly about public APIs. Seems like it should be as easy as halting the recursive walk altogether (which would treat the stability as unmarked). What do you think?\n",
