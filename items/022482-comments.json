    "body": "I'm a little worried about adding a large number of `from_foo` constructors (it should probably be done with a trait instead). Another route would possibly be to add an `IntoCString` trait with one `into_cstring` method that's defined for strs, strings, byte slices, vectors, etc. That would, however, require 2 imports instead of the usual one to make the type usable (`IntoCString` + `CString`).\n\nI did in general yeah feel a little uncomfortable marking these changes as `#[stable]` just yet for these reasons. I don't mind exploring some other possibilities in the meantime though.\n\nTo make progress on #16035 I think that we would need to `#[deprecate]` the `as_ptr` method. I think we would want to do some more analysis in this area first, though. In switching the return type I immediately get 10 errors in the standard library for patterns like:\n\n``` rust\nlet ptr = opt_cstr.map(|s| s.as_ptr()).unwrap_or(0 as *const _);\n```\n\nIn general I'm pretty wary about #16035 due to our forays to \"make unsafe APIs a little safer\" largely being unsuccessful. I do agree, though, that if we do it now is the time. I would probably personally vote to not do it myself.\n",
