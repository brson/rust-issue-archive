    "body": "Local variables are semantically memory locations on the stack, which can own values. Move semantics means that something like `let a_ = a;` moves the _value_ out of `a` (into a new independent stack slot `a_`), leaving the latter as an \"empty\" stack slot. It's possible to reinitialise the slot (i.e. put a new value into it) and continue to use it, e.g. `a = A { val: 2 }; println!(\"{}\", a.val);` works perfectly OK. Rust somewhat tracks the initialisation state of structs on a per-field basis but it doesn't do this fully, as demonstrated by `a.val` not working, but it could in future. In other words, Rust allows writing to the individual fields of an empty stack slot, but doesn't then follow this through to allow reading the ones that have been initialised.\n\nIt would be unsafe if `a.val = 2` caused `a_.val` to also be `2`, as it would be a source of mutable sharing which is the core thing Rust tries to control/protect against.\n\nClosing as not-a-bug, but thanks for filing!\n",
