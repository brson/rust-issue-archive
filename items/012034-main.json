  "body": "I was looking into #9303 and was curious if this would still be valuable. @kballard had already done 99% of the work, so I brought the branch up to date and added a feature gate. Any feedback would be appreciated; I wasn't sure if this should be set up as a syntax extension with `#[macro_registrar]`, and if so, where it should be located.\n\nOriginal PR is here: #9255\n\nTODO:\n- [x] Convert to loadable syntax extension\n- [x] Default to big endian\n- [x] Add `target` identifier\n- [x] Expand to include code points 128-255\n",
