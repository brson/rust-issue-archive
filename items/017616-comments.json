    "body": "cc @alexcrichton\n\nIf the rule is that definition always comes before docs, then it's a problem that we document macros like structs or enums rather than like functions.  We certainly don't want to put the full source of every function before its description.\n\nAnd I think there will be plenty of macros as large as `bitflags!`. A sophisticated macro abstracts in the same way a function does; you don't need to understand the full implementation to use it.  If we put the full implementation in rustdoc, that suggests that macros are merely for convenience in abbreviating code, which limits the usefulness of the feature.\n\nMaybe the simple fix is a `#[doc(summarize)]` attribute for `macro_rules!` that just leaves off the RHS (which is still visible through the \"src\" link.)\n",

If we move some code around, we can parse into LHSes and RHSes on macro definition, and then have rustdoc display only the former.  I think I can get this in place for 1.0-stable.\n",

The proposed change to only show the left arm of the macro would look like this.\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! bitflags {\n    ($(#[$attr:meta])* flags $BitFlags:ident: $T:ty {\n        $($(#[$Flag_attr:meta])* const $Flag:ident = $value:expr),+\n    }) => { ... },\n    ($(#[$attr:meta])* flags $BitFlags:ident: $T:ty {\n        $($(#[$Flag_attr:meta])* const $Flag:ident = $value:expr),+,\n    }) => { ... },\n}\n```\n\nA welcome change.\n",

    "body": "I have a similar issue, though it cannot easily be solved by just showing the left arm of the macro since there are multiple internal rules and they refer to each other: https://github.com/m4rw3r/chomp/blob/60cb0fb111e079c472c02821cee5e82b0eef2b82/src/macros.rs#L71\n\nIf we just go with the left arm of the macro it will result in a lot of nonsensical entrypoints:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! parse {\n    ( @RET($i:expr); @ $t_ty:ty , $e_ty:ty : $e:expr ) => { ... };\n    ( @RET($i:expr); $e:expr ) => { ... };\n    ( @ERR($i:expr); @ $t_ty:ty , $e_ty:ty : $e:expr ) => { ... };\n    // ...\n    ( $i:expr ; err $($tail:tt)+ ) => { ... };\n    // ...\n    ( $i:expr ) => { $i };\n}\n```\n\nAnd skipping the internal rules will make the macro even more incomprehensible since the entrypoints themselves just parse a bit of the tokens for each invocation.\n\nFor my case I would think that just hiding the whole macro definition would solve the problem (maybe with some button to expand the definition), since I have to explain how the macro is used anyway since it by itself says nothing unless people are very experienced with rust macros.\n\nAs a workaround I have defined a hidden macro which contains the actual definition: https://github.com/m4rw3r/chomp/blob/5016d0b9e636156927e514f430e33510d9fa94f7/src/macros.rs#L76\n",
