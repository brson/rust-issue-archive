    "body": "Found what was causing this in combine-language from @arielb1's hint, it wasn't the order of crate declarations though. For the types I implemented Parser for I had declared the associated types in the reverse order of how they were implemented/written in combine. After switching that (and fixing a few compilation errors which this ICE had hidden) I could compile the tests again.\n\n(See https://github.com/Marwes/combine-language/commit/28d791be60d22eea46e80b3310d4a66f6a580837#diff-b4aea3e418ccdb71239b96952d9cddb6L55),\n\nThe [project](https://github.com/Marwes/embed_lang) where I used combine-language also had the same reverse order which seems to be the reason it did not run into the ICE. After updating that to use the version of combine-language with the fix it now ceases to compile (and fixing the order there makes it work again). Unforutunately, the next crate which includes the parser crate is now broken by the same error which I haven't figured out the cause for.\n",
