If you refer to `Foo::bar`, it's not clear in resolve whether you are referring to a trait impl or an inherent one, so I think we delay resolution until collection has already run. I think it will end up as an ambiguity error during method resolution right now (since that handles associated consts), and if we had inherent impls for associated types it would have to be dealt with in collect, too.\n\n(All that said, code that follows the usual naming conventions will have uppercase names for constants and lowercase for methods, so this PR probably does cover the most important cases in practice.)\n",

Normally in Rust there are two namespaces: types and values. If I am reading the code right, this is reporting an error for something like:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo {\n    type Bar;\n    fn Bar();\n}\n```\n\nI don't think this is correct. We should report an error if there are two constants/fns with the same name or two types, but between those two groups aliasing is legal. \n",
