    "body": "@thestinger Do you have any suggestions? Functionally equivalent to C++11 requires something of the form `<start token><user-supplied delimiter><delimiter end token><raw text><delimiter start token><user supplied delimiter><end token>`. In C++11 the `<start token>` is `R\"`, the `<delimiter end token>` is `(`, the `<delimiter start token>` is `)`, and `<end token>` is `\"`. I don't think you can remove any of these components without breaking functionality, and I don't think you can adjust the values to produce something less noisy.\n\nThe only adjustment I can think of would be to remove `<delimiter start/end token>` and instead require that the `<user supplied delimiter>` includes an appropriate punctuation to end it (and to start the close sequence), but if anything that makes it _more_ confusing, not less.\n",

    "body": "It's probably also worth re-mentioning the various use-cases which have a desire for some sort of syntax that is not what we have today:\n1. Regular expressions. These contain lots of backslashes and normally escapes aren't even really that necessary. If we used the normal string syntax, everything would have to be double-escaped which is a pain. The main stickler about this desired syntax is that this would want to be very usable (in the sense that it shouldn't be a pain to write/read read the strings of regular expressions, at least no more than it already is).\n2. Literal windows paths. Perhaps these should be done in a different manner to be portable, but regardless having to escape the `\\` character is a real pain. As with regular expressions, in theory the string syntax isn't difficult to read.\n3. Giant blobs of raw text, such as formatting an HTML document (like what rustdoc does right now). This is different from regular expressions in that I they don't need to be so easily readable (because the body of the text is normally very large), so the custom delimiters surrounding the text I believe would be find in this case.\n4. `format!` string directives. Right now it's a pain to print a `\\` character because you have to type `println!(\"\\\\\\\\\")`. As with regular expressions though, this should be easy to read and easy to use (because it may be fairly common). Perhaps this should use a different escape though, which would make this irrelevant.\n\nThose are the use cases that I could think of, others may have more\n",

    "body": "The restriction to sequences of `#` has some bad corner cases, where I can imagine one sitting and manually counting, since the eye does not immediately distinguish and/or match { `#####`, `######` and `#####` } the same way it can with { `#five#` `#six#` and `#five#` }.\n\nI would personally prefer C++11 (or any variant that does not restrict the user-selected token sequence to such an impoverished alphabet), and instead leave restrictions (e.g. to `##*`) up to an end-developer policy (with checks for particular restrictions available as a lint).\n\nThe theoretician in me wants to say \"here's a compromise: the end user sequence is strings drawn from a two element alphabet, for example the regexp `#(#|_)*`, or perhaps even `(#|_)*`\"  (Not 100% sure whether the latter is too broad.)  Then I still get to write e.g. { `#_#`, `##_`, `#_#` } which is easier on my eyes than the above encodings of five and six.\n\n---\n\nBut it is not a big deal to me; its certainly not as important as just having _some_ choose-your-own delimiter option, even if it did end up being solely drawn from strings of `#`.\n\n---\n\n(one last note: I realized after I wrote this that I misrepresented kimundi's proposal slightly, since kimundi's proposal is not a mere restriction of the C++11 proposal, so its not as if we could start with C++11 and just add a lint.  But I think the rest of my note holds up.  Especially the last part, where I said its not a big deal to me.  :) )\n",

    "body": "@pnkfelix: All fair points, however I think in practice you'd never need to have more than one or two `#`: It's only necessary to add more if your raw string literally contains `\"#`, `\"##`, `\"###` etc.\n\n@kballard: Likewise, in that example there would be no need for more than one `#`:\n\n```\nr#\"(\\w+)   # match word chars\n   \"[^\"]*\" # followed by a quoted string\n   (\\d+)   # followed by digits\"#.flag(\"x\").match_groups();\n```\n\nPersonally, I'm weary of the \"any string as delimiter\" approach: It can more easily lead to inconsistencies and style issues because every literal might use a different one. \n\nRestricting it to one character at least restricts the possibly variations to one dimension, the length, and that people will tend to make as short as possible. ;)\n",

    "body": "I see this as a twofold issue, as 'raw' string literals are really separated into two groups from what I can tell. The use cases described so far are: regexes, which have lots of backslashes; Windows paths, which have lots of backslashes; giant blobs of raw text, which may contain literally anything as often such blobs are generated by other programs or are programs in an unknown-to-rust other language; and format! string directives, which have lots of backslashes.\n\nSo for 3/4 cases the only important attribute is a readable way to hold backslashes (which means that regular -style escaping will not suffice). There are a few good proposals which solve this problem; my favorite is r\"foo\"\"bar\" syntax where only the \" char is handled specially (with doubling as the escape). The listed drawback to this approach is that it \"Does not reproduce verbatim every character found in the source sequence, which makes it slightly harder/more confusing to read, and more annoying to do things like pasting a raw string into your source file (e.g. raw HTML).\"\n\n_No_ scheme will pass through verbatim every character in the source sequence for _all sequences_. The workaround of ensuring that any single character always passes through verbatim _except_ if its context is composed of other characters which comprise the end delimiter is more complicated than an unconditional (character-based rather than sequence-based) escaping scheme and harder to quickly check.\n\nUsing r\"foo\"\"bar\" syntax will also allow, if a user does insert text containing single double quotes, a compile-time failure so that they can fix the string. It's not a 100% solution since someone wanting two adjacent double-quotes (who would only get one back) would not be warned, but it's a very simple syntax which shouldn't take long for users to learn especially if their likely first mistake of using one quote instead of two would cause a compile-time error.\n\nI don't see a strong case for embedding large blobs of text in source, as that practice is poor form in general: editors rarely provide much support for working with arbitrary languages embedded in strings and the approach is increasingly awkward as the blobs grow in size. I would advise against encouraging this antipattern with language workarounds, especially considering that they do not fully solve the problem of escaping (either you must constantly worry about updating delimiters, or you must escape occurrences in the blob; either way there must be a manual or automatic processing step). Using an include! macro to reference separate files to insert data blobs seems a better approach, as it _does_ fully avoid the problems in delimiters/escaping, and the data blobs can then be constructed separately and statically checked for correctness in their native language as part of the build process without having to extract them from Rust code for that purpose. As a language which likes to demonstrate what can be achieved with types I think it would be a shame to see big text blobs being considered idiomatic rust; we should rather discourage stringly-typed data.\n",

    "body": "I'd really prefer to have format string syntax and regex syntax that simply use another escape character (like `printf`'s and lua's `%`) over overloading `\\` to serve that role in way different contexts and then requiring people to select the right string literal syntax for every context. I realise that can't address the use case of hardcoded Windows paths. For embedding output by other programs into rust source code, I think it's reasonable to just pipe them through an adaptor first that properly escapes them if an `include!()` macro isn't appropriate there.\n\nI'd prefer to keep the amount of different options of string literals (and I suppose the complexity of a correct lexer) as low as possible in this case. :(\n",

If I'm embedding a section of raw HTML, I'm pretty sure I can come up with a delimiter that's highly unlikely to show up.\n\nThe problem with the `r\"foo\"\"bar\"` solution is that even for short strings, it really _sucks_ when the string contains many quotes. For example if I need a raw string that contains a snippet of code `[\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"vector\", \"of\", \"&str\"]` then it's pretty bad: `r\"[\"\"this\"\", \"\"is\"\", \"\"a\"\", \"\"vector\"\", \"\"of\"\", \"\"&str\"\"]\"`.\n",

    "body": "Excellent choice. For my own language design I've looked at every syntax out there as well as coming up with several of my own, and this is the least verbose and complex, while also allowing any string to be delimited. Fortunately, bad arguments, like the one for doubling `\"`, were rejected. It's not true that \"the only important attribute is a readable way to hold backslashes\" -- **both** backslashes and double quotes are special characters in normal string literals. And the claim that \"you must constantly worry about updating delimiters\" is simply false. You will never in practice encounter a text containing `\"##`.\r\n\r\nI actually somewhat prefer Kimundi's second proposal, which is a superset of the one adopted: rX\"text\"X, where X is either empty or is any sequence starting with `#` ... of course it can be abused, but so can anything, and there's no _need_ to abuse it, and I believe in giving programmers freedom.",
