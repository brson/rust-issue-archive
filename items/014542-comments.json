    "body": "I agree. But since names of primitive types are allowed to be names of items it may be advisable to warn user in cases when it introduces ambiguity (type definitions, structs, enums, traits). I believe that was the reason why issue #1766 was opened.\nIt looks like it's possible to disambiguate between user-defined types and built-in ones by using path (e.g. `self::u16`) so it's not as bad as I thought.\nIt turns out deriving needs a fix as\n\n```\n#[deriving(Show)]\nstruct u16;\n```\n\nresults in compilation error.\n",
