This would fix the inference problem. Assuming an opt-in world, everything would look like:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Mutex<T> {\n   lock: RawMutex,\n   data: Unsafe<T>\n}\n\nimpl<T: Send> Share for Mutex<T> {}\n```\n\nToday's compiler would reject this code because it does not think that `Unsafe<T>` is `Share`. If the compiler thought that `Unsafe<T>` were indeed `Share`, then the type `Mutex<T>` would be `Share`\n",

    "body": "@FlaPer87 Thanks! I think the biggest things we're hoping for are:\n1) a workaround that we can use for now until the Right Thing lands that isn't as ugly as copying over all of the old sync crate\n2) making sure that this gets fixed at some point in the future\n\nI appreciate the offer, but don't need to you drop everything you're doing and work on this, especially since it sounds invasive enough that we probably couldn't cherry-pick it and we would like to finish off this Rust upgrade before we start in on yet another.\n",

    "body": "@larsbergstrom if you can pay for an extra allocation, I've worked around this issue for now by representing an `Arc<Mutex<Foo>>` as an `Arc<Mutex<*()>>` and casting between `*()` and `~Foo` as needed. It's a bit hacky, and you'll need to make sure that there's a destructor that can clean up after it, but it's not too horrible.\n",
