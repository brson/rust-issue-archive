We have it defined because it's an abi that can be used.\n\nI don't think that it's the one that windows uses internally at least for kernel32.dll because our `system` calling convention currently maps to C for windows on 64-bit, and I've heard that it's working (instead of horribly dying).\n\nI may be wrong though, do you think that the win64 calling convention is the predominant one on win64?\n",
