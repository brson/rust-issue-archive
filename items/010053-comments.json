    "body": "An opinion from left field:\n\nThis would prevent users from seeding the RNGs with fixed values and getting a fixed output stream across Rust versions. If I'm writing an automated test of some mathematical routine that uses random numbers, I may seed it so I will get the same results each time; if Rust changes the RNG under me, my tests will break.\n\n(For example, I may have some algorithm for sampling from a weird probability distribution. I could seed the RNG and compare Rust's output to a known-good algorithm, but then the output would change a few versions later.)\n",
