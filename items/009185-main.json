  "body": "While usage of change_dir_locked is synchronized against itself, it's not\nsynchronized against other relative path usage, so I'm of the opinion that it\njust really doesn't help in running tests. In order to prevent the problems that\nhave been cropping up, this completely removes the function.\n\nAll existing tests (except one) using it have been moved to run-pass tests where\nthey get their own process and don't need to be synchronized with anyone else.\n\nThere is one now-ignored rustpkg test because when I moved it to a run-pass test\napparently run-pass isn't set up to have 'extern mod rustc' (it ends up having\nlinkage failures).\n",
