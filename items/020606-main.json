  "body": "This commit prepares the liblibc library to be moved to crates.io. Unlike the\nlog, serialize, term, etc crates, the source for this crate will _not_ be\nduplicated out-of-tree. Instead a new rust-lang/libc repository will be created\nwith a submodule to this repository and it will use the source directly.\n\nIn order to compile within the stable ecosystem of Rust, this crate cannot link\nto libcore, and it also needs some tweaks for the other attributes that it has.\nAs a result this commit tweaks the source of the crate to link to libcore when\nbuilt in tree but link to libstd when built via cargo.\n\nNote that the rust-lang/libc crate isn't quite prepared just yet, there's a\nCargo bug or two that I'd like to iron out before publishing it. This is simply\npreparing the in-tree source.\n",
