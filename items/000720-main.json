  "body": "This essentially starts the bootstrapping one step earlier by building\nthe stdlib from source using the stage0 compiler and then using that\nstdlib to build the stage1 compiler. (Instead of starting by building\nthe stage1 compiler and then building a stdlib with it).\n\nThis means we should now be able to add features to the stdlib and use\nthem in the compiler without having to do a snapshot. (On the flip\nside, this means that we now need to do a snapshot if we want to use a\nnew language feature in the stdlib, but that doesn't really seem too\nburdensome (we already need to snapshot if we want to use a new\nlanguage feature in the compiler)).\n",
