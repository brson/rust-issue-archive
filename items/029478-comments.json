    "body": "Thanks for the quick update! I'd like to make sure we add regression tests if possible, however, to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\n\nFor the MinGW case I discovered that it's related to linking in C++ code, so could you also add a `run-make`? I don't think that our C++ compiler detection is the best, so it's fine for the test just to be enabled on MinGW for now and we can enable it elsewhere later. It just needs to be something like:\n\n``` c\n// foo.cpp\nextern \"C\" void foo() {\n    int *a = new int(3);\n    delete a;\n}\n```\n\n``` rust\nextern { fn foo(); }\nfn main() {\n    unsafe { foo(); }\n}\n```\n\n```\n$ g++ foo.cpp -c\n$ ar crus libfoo.a foo.o\n$ rustc foo.rs -L. -lfoo -lstdc++\n$ ./foo.exe\n```\n",

    "body": "OK, after further investigation about libcmt/msvcrt, it looks like this was just working by luck beforehand. A few of the objects compiled in that test were not compiled with `/MD` (which I believe msvcrt.lib corresponds to), and then when compiler-rt.lib was also imposing some restrictions on the CRT in use it ended up causing problems.\n\nThis brings up the interesting question, however, of how these files should be compiled. It looks like the MSVC build of compiler-rt may not be quite ready just yet? I would expect it to compile to a library that actually has 0 dependencies, but it looks like it even depends on symbols like `VirtualProtect` and other CRT functions like `fflush` perhaps.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what compiler-rt is doing, but it seems like we're pulling in more than we may want.\n",

As I can see from link you've provided LLVM has just different names of function depending on conditional, while my code has also different handling which is crucial. I'd be happy if those changes are kept otherwise iOS support will be broken.\n",
