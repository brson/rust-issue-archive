  "body": "std: remove the `equals` method from `TotalEq`.\n\n`TotalEq` is now just an assertion about the `Eq` impl of a\ntype (i.e. `==` is a total equality if a type implements `TotalEq`) so\nthe extra method is just confusing.\n\nAlso, a new method magically appeared as a hack to allow deriving to\nassert that the contents of a struct/enum are also TotalEq, because the\nderiving infrastructure makes it very hard to do anything but create a\ntrait method. (You didn't hear about this horrible work-around from me\n:(.)\n",
