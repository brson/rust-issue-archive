    "body": "@brohee, thanks for your report!\n\nI would say that the `static` example works as intended. Whenever you're naming a constant value, you should use `const`. `static` should only be used when the memory location of the datum is significant, which it isn't for values appearing in patterns within `match` expressions.\n\nIn any case, relaxing this would require a concrete RFC to be put forward and discussed. Please take a look at the process in https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#what-the-process-is if you're interested in pursuing that direction.\n\nI will leave this bug open to track the fact that absolute paths don't work with range patterns, which is what's responsible for the second example not parsing. That is certainly not intended.\n",
