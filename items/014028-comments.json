    "body": "Crap. You're right. Although I think automatically normalizing `./foo` to `foo` is still valid, the only invalid operation is automatically interpreting `..` segments. This means that #11650 is still valid for `Process::new()`, because it does need to treat `./foo` and `foo` differently, although the `dynamic_library::open_external` part will work correctly with Paths if this is fixed.\n\nThis is unfortunate, because automatically normalizing paths made a lot of things work better in the path library. But I think we can leave the current implementation in place as long as we're ok with e.g. `.filename()` returning `..` (which seems like reasonable behavior).\n\nI guess this means the path library will partially-normalize on `Path` creation, making safe changes like squashing `//` to `/` and removing `.` components (e.g. everything it does now except for handling of `..` components), and it will expose a `.normalize()` method that handles `..` components.\n",

I suppose technically, the `.` entry could point to a different inode than the current directory, but I think we could reasonably consider that filesystem to be broken.\n",
