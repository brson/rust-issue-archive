  "body": "Inspired by [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25536654/rust-ownership-rules-in-the-context-of-closures/25537552) on Stack Overflow. I feel like maybe there is an ownership rule missing, in section 18.2, which would describe why you cannot do this:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = 5i;\n    let y = &x; \n    x = 6i; // error: cannot assign to `x` because it is borrowed\n}\n```\n\nThere is an example which shows this error in the closure section, but it actually has nothing to do with closures and is more about a general principle of \"the owner can't mutate what it owns while it has been borrowed\"\n",
