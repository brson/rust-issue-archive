    "body": "This is no longer a duplicate symbol error, but has progressed to being a type error. The problem is that resolve adds an extra _impl into the iscopes list for b's re-export of `to_str`. I think this is a resolve bug: resolve shouldn't add an _impl twice in two different scopes for an impl with the same def_id. I was able to fix it by making `typeck::check::method::lookup::add_candidates_from_scope` remove duplicate entries from the iscopes -- but that was a terrible performance regression, and anyway, resolve shouldn't add the same def_id twice.\n\nI checked in the test case as `src/test/run-pass/issue-2242-d.rs`. Reassigning to @pcwalton , who can hopefully make sure the resolve rewrite doesn't reproduce this bug :-)\n",
