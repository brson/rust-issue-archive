    "body": "I believe the problem is that the negative reasoning you need is: `Bar<T>: !Foo<T>`, but we do not know this to be true. For example, we are afraid that some downstream crate might define:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Baz { }\nimpl Foo<Baz> for Bar<Baz> { }\nimpl Base for Baz { }\n```\n\nI believe this does, in fact, pass the current orphan rules (at least if we adopted [Covered First](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/01/14/little-orphan-impls/)). Based on the table at the end, it seems to fall under the `Cow<MyVec<T>,T>` scenario. (However, I know I have also thought that we might be able to tighten up coherence to take the orphan rules into account, and I think I was thinking of cases like this.) So I guess I have to double check just what is going on here in that respect.\n",

It's a little unfortunate if it is correctly rejected: this sort of blanket impl is useful in cases like `IntoIterator` having a blanket impl for all `Iterator`s (i.e. `IntoIterator` acts as a converter, and having an automatic noop conversion grants flexibility/usability), but with type parameters.\n\n(The concrete use-case I was thinking of was allowing all [`InPlace`s](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ops/trait.InPlace.html) to be a [`Placer`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ops/trait.Placer.html).)\n",
