    "body": "Caveat: While I believe this PR does not affect other crates (and the most important test cases do pass), `make check` somehow fails on the unexpected tests so they need to be reexamined. In particular,\n- On my Windows machine (with 32-bit MinGW) `make check` always failed even after reconfigure and `make clean`, due to the linkage problem from the differing function hash. I'm not very sure about the underlying reason.\n- On `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` host/target, `debug-info/function-prologue-stepping-no-split-stack` and `debug-info/recursive-enum` mysteriously fails. (And I should also note that the lack of `check-stage2-cfail-full` make target drove me crazy, aargh.)\n",
