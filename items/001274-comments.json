Valid targets are: host, x86,\n                          x86_64, sparc, powerpc, arm, mips, spu, xcore,\n                          msp430, ptx, cbe, and cpp (default=all)\n  --enable-cbe-printf-a   Enable C Backend output with hex floating point via\n                          %a (default is YES)\n  --enable-bindings       Build specific language bindings:\n                          all,auto,none,{binding-name} (default=auto)\n  --enable-libffi         Check for the presence of libffi (default is NO)\n  --enable-ltdl-install   install libltdl\n```\n\nOut of all these, I think the only ones we can really disable that are on by default are:\n- Threads (unneeded for the compiler as it isn't multithreaded)\n- All language bindings (automatically built if you have ocaml, for example)\n- JIT\n- Timestamps (but I'm willing to bet this is almost totally negligable.)\n\nI've got a patch with the above (modulo the timestamping) that I'm currently building and validating the test suite against. Will open pull request soon.\n",
