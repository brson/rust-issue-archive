    "body": "This is still an issue and under the right circumstances is severe enough that it entirely blocks compilation of real-world code due to OOM.\r\nThe reproduction [here](https://github.com/syntacticsugarglider/rustc-bug-mcve) exercises the issue both on the latest nightly and with the changes from #77325 applied, which does seem to mediate the issue as it was exercised by some other (previous) reproductions but isn't consistent across all examples that exercise the issue. I reported both #74456 and #70513 which I've now closed but each independently reproduce the issue (though, again, some of those reproductions are fixed by #77325). The underlying problem here isn't solved by anything that's been implemented since, though, and it's still blocking the work I was trying to do when I submitted those issues some 7 or 8 months ago. There was a long and winding discussion of this in [this](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/investigating.20obligations.20blowup/near/229421838) zulip thread with the ultimate conclusion that all of the previously filed issues all share the same cause.\r\nI would love to contribute a fix but I don't fully understand the current process by which projections are normalized. I have a vague understanding of the rewriting process but not the actual operations that are being performed here, the purpose of the cache, the \"ambiguity\" mentioned in the FIXME comment in the source (which appears to be the cause of the duplication), etc. and no understanding of what steps would be necessary to correct the underlying issue.\r\nIs the normalization process in its current state documented anywhere in a way that's focused on implementation details?",

I'll do some profiling when I get a chance and play around with different repros, definitely possible it's a different issue. ",
