The general idea is that I'm not sure how to deal with type parameters right now.\n\nI think that `~str` and `&str` should be pretty easily possible (seeing how there's no type parameters), but I don't think that we should change the standard library crucially to get better documentation. I think we should explore the routes of making rustdoc/rustc work better together to get the existing methods of defining vecs/strs better.\n\nIn the future it sounds like the \"vector builder\" will be a documentable type, but slices and fixed-size arrays will always be able to have methods on them and we should be able to document them somehow.\n\nI think that the threshold for knowing whether the docs are sufficient is currently answering the question \"What can I do with `~[T]`\" because the answer right now is \"dig through one of 12 traits\"\n",

    "body": "Hm, so rustdoc will always have to do _something_ special in order to deal with primitive types, but there's also a question to what degree rustc itself needs to be modified as well.\n\nThat may work though having a private `type bool = bool` or `type Vec<T> = ~[T]` in these files and then the lang item is attached to that type instead. You've then got a bunch of defids to thread through, but things like privacy/reachability have to ensure that these are not considered dead.\n\nI haven't really given these too much thought, my main goal was to get _something_ reasonable for primitive types, but perhaps for vectors some sort of lang item not on the impl may work best.\n",
