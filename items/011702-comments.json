    "body": "@SiegeLord of course, any output format has to deal with the embedded spaces problem in the general case ... what do you think a hypothetical `--dep-info-list` output to stdout should do for them?  The main options I can think of are:\n- Put delimiters around each path (such as a pair of `'`'s). Of course this then just complicates file names with embedded quotes, or whatever other delimiter is used.\n- Use a separator other than space to separate the entries.  One obvious option is newline... then one can use `xargs` to reassemble that output to a single line, and many line-oriented unix tools should work reasonably well with this option.\n\nI am making an implicit assumption here that paths with embedded spaces are more common than embedded newlines or embedded quotation marks; does that sound right?\n\nAn aside: The last time I had to wrestle with embedded spaces on a serious project, I ended up bailing on trying to handle the embedded spaces themselves (which were coming from absolute paths on good old Windows), and instead I changed the build infrastructure so that `configure` generated relative paths to the source.  (So your project itself was not allowed to have files with embedded spaces, but you could at least put your build underneath a directory that did have embedded spaces, such as \"My Documents\" or whatever it is called.)\n\n---\n\n(A sad thing is that adopting either of these proposals will make my typical use case harder, but that's okay.)\n",

    "body": "Cargo is actively hostile to being used as/with a system package manager: rustc can't link to `/usr/lib` when installed there because it completely ignores the FHS, distros will never accept an ecosystem that builds its own set of C libraries for _that_ reason alone, and even if they did, they won't package it because Cargo doesn't even plan to support offline/restricted builds for use in build bots and source-based package managers where you're verboten to touch anything outside the build tree, including the network.\n\nIf Rust is ever going to become a Systems Language(tm) in the sense that we implement system libraries to be built, installed and depended on with standard system utilities, Cargo will need a serious overhaul.\n",
