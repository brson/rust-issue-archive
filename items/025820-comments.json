    "body": "All rlibs are actually just static archives (e.g. `*.a` files) so tools like `nm` and `ar` will work on them naturally assuming they ignore the non-object files located within (e.g. metadata and bytecode). As @lifthrasiir mentioned, however, I'd love to have a tool to inspect the _metadata_ in more detail to, for example, dump a module structure, type signatures, etc. The metadata format is a huge black box and is indeed all centralized around `rustc::metadata`. Note that a tool which does lots and lots with metadata will likely want to be tightly integrated to rustdoc as well as rustdoc already has tons of code to inspect metadata and reconstruct ASTs and/or module hierarchies.\n",

I'm more than willing to answer questions though!\n\n> How do .rlibs link against 'normal' dynamic libraries provided to rustc via -l ?\n\nNo actual linkage occurs, the compiler emits information into the rlib metadata saying what dynamic native libraries should be linked in later, but they're not actually linked until the rlib is linked into a dylib or executable. If the rlib is later used to assemble a staticlib the compiler just prints out what native libraries are needed to link everything.\n\n> Is there an ELF image inside the ar somewhere that's dynamically linked against them?\n\nNah the only ELF file inside rlibs is the object file that the compiler generates (and possibly the object files of native static libraries linked against).\n\n> Or does rust embed dynamic loader code e.g dlopen?\n\nNo the compiler doesn't embed any code like this in this respect.\n",

    "body": "I am trying to obtain the stdlib bitcode, so I can use `llvm-link` to produce a self-contained bitcode program. Being able to extract it from the rlibs would be nice, because those are bundled with Rust, and I wouldn\u2019t have to compile everything from source. However, I have been unable to decompress the `bytecode.deflate` file, which makes sense if it contains Rust-specific headers. (It definitely starts with `RUST_OBJECT`.) Is there a simple way to strip these headers so I can inflate the data?",
