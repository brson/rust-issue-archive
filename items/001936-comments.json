    "body": "Yeah. I struggled with trying to decide criteria for this while reorganizing things, and came up with:\n- `core::path` is for (more-or-less pure) functions that manipulate the path datatype, as well as the definition of the type. That is: concatenating, splitting, normalizing, querying structural facts about paths (absolute-ness, file extension, etc)\n- `core::os` contains all the convenience interfaces for retrieving, creating, probing, deleting and otherwise manipulating filesystems and other aspects of the operating system environment. whether or not those inquiries or manipulations take or return paths as arguments is not relevant, any more than taking and returning file descriptors, strings or io channels would be.\n\nI also eliminated the `fs` module and split its functions between `path` and `os` along these criteria.\n\nIt's not great, but I couldn't think of any other criteria that made for a cleaner split. Willing to listen to arguments.\n",
