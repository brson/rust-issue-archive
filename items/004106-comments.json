    "body": "This is confusing behavior.\n\nAt the time we were hoping that it would be useful to know at compile time that your rustdoc didn't actually apply to anything. It has helped me a few times, particularly when I use an outer rustdoc at the top of a file, like `/** */`, but I should be using `/*! */`.\n\nI agree though that it would be better for this to be a rustdoc error instead of a rustc error, but there are complications.\n\nThe reason it's like this is because rustdocs are actually discovered in the _lexer_, and converted to attributes so that the parser can associate them with items (or whatever) just like any attribute. Otherwise you have to have some heuristic that later extracts the doc comments and tries to associate them with code.\n\nOne very nice thing that parsing rustdocs into attributes allows us to do is put the docs directly into the crate metadata. In theory we should be able to extract docs from existing, compiled crates, and also get docs at runtime. If we stopped parsing rustdocs at compile time we would lose that property.\n\nOne possibility is to put a flag on the lexer to control whether it extracts docs. Under normal compilation it would ignore them, but rustdoc would lex the docs. In the future, when it is actually useful, crates could add a `#[embed_docs]` attribute to turn on doc lexing.\n\n@nikomatsakis has expressed opinions about this before.\n",

There might be some special rules to allow things like\n\n`fn a(); /// doc comment on same line`.\n\nRustdoc could then emit error messages like:\n\n `failed to find associated item for doc-comment at line:col ...`.\n",

    "body": "@Dretch I am not sure whether it would be bad or not. It is harder. If we went in that direction we should remove doc comments from the lexer. We already have code that can extract all comments from source files for the pretty printer to use, so rustdoc could just dig through those for doc comments.\n\nThe big win we could get from that approach would be to remove 'inner doc comments' that use `!`, instead just making a guess based on the position of the comment and surrounding context about what the comment applies to. I do think this is how most people expect doc comments to work.\n",
