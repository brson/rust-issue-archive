  "body": "The internals of strftime were converted to use a single formatter,\ninstead of creating and concatenating a bunch of small strings. This\nshowed ~3x improvement in the benches.\n\nAlso, since the formatted time may be going straight to a Writer, TmFmt\nwas introduced, and is returned from all formatting methods on Tm. This\nallows the saving of another string allocation. Anyone wanting a String\ncan just call .to_string() on the returned value.\n\nThis runs validation prior to return the created `TmFmt`, catching errors before formatting happens. The specialized formats skip this validation, since we already know they are valid.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
