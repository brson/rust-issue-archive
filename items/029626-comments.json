    "body": "Hm I [have the same concerns as before](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/29083#discussion_r42522088) where if we start annotating reexports we may want to hammer down the semantics first. For example what does it mean to have a stable reexport of an unstable item? An unstable reexport of a stable item? I'd personally expect:\n- Stable reexport of stable -- ok, everything is stable\n- Unstable reexport of unstable -- ok, everything is unstable\n- Stable reexport of unstable -- compiler error\n- Unstable reexport of stable -- ok, unstable to reference via this name but stable to reference via the other name.\n",

    "body": "Yes, I'd like to hear what people actually dealing with library stabilization want and expect.\nI suppose the same scheme will be used later in third party crates when stability/deprecation is available for them.\nBelow I assume, that all variants are implementable without complete rewrite of resolve :smile: (I'm not sure in it yet), i.e. every imported name knows through which `use` it was imported.\n\nOne pole is maximum flexibility - an original entity can be accessed with different names imported through multiple imports, or without imports at all if it can be accessed directly. Each of these paths should have its own stability/deprecation attribute and they are completely independent.\nA name can be deprecated and the new non-deprecated name created with `use`.\nAn item in e.g. libcore can be unstable and be moved around libcore freely, but have a stable reexport in libstd which location is fixed.\n\nAnother extreme is \"one true stability\" - every accessible entity have a stability attribute on it and aliases are completely ignored. In this case it would be better to make annotating them an error and remove existing annotations to avoid confusion.\n\nBoth approaches have drawbacks, however. \"One true stability\" is too rigid - you can't rename things and deprecate old names. With \"maximum flexibility\" even if an item is unstable we can't change its signature if it's stably reexported, it can be mitigated by \"Stable reexport of unstable -- compiler error\" as you mentioned, and keeping only deprecation attributes completely independent. Some new form of stability inheritance can be introduced, so reexports will possibly have, but not _require_ stability, their stability will be inherited from the exported items if necessary and still considered by the checking pass. Or stability of `use` can be inherited from its containing module (but it seems useless).\n\nIn general, I have no strong opinion and can, e.g. \"revert\" this PR and delete the confusing existing annotations instead until they are actually considered, or I can leave everything optional, as now. That's why I'd like to hear more opinions.\n",
