    "body": "@Thiez: Agreed, this is not inherently _unsafe_. So maybe `panic!()` on building the StepBy is not the right option. Still, there are enough options to loop forever already, and as I said, the docs should at least remind the reader that supplying `0` as an argument creates an infinite range.\n\nIt may also be useful to be able to issue a warning on debug builds iff a `StepBy { step_by: 0, .. } is actually iterated; perhaps as an additional Debug option.\n",
