  "body": "TrieSet doesn't yet have union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference functions implemented.  Luckily, TrieSet is largely similar to TreeSet, so I was able to reference the implementations of these functions in the latter, and adapt them as necessary to make them work for TrieSet.\n\nOne thing that I thought was interesting is that the Iterator yielded by `iter()` for TrieSet iterates over the set's values directly rather than references to the values (whereas I think in most cases I see the Iterator given by `iter()` iterating over immutable references), so for consistency within TrieSet's interface, all of these Iterators also iterate over the values directly.  Let me know if all of these should be instead iterating over references.\n",
