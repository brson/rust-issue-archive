Having well defined behavior for forking processes would be nice, but getting it right across all the supported systems may be challenging.\r\n\r\nChromium is a good example of something that uses fork to spawn child processes that self-sandbox to drop privileges and reduce attack surface.\r\n\r\nThe way to do this kind of thing today is to use the fork syscall directly early when the process is setting things up before threads are created and use inherited file descriptors /etc as ways to communicate between processes.",
