    "body": "FWIW, another somewhat similar case is items declared inside `fn`s. Theoretically if you have an `fn` or `static` declared inside the body of an `fn`, you could infer its type without breaking the principle of \"no type inference at the API level\". It probably doesn't make much difference from the perspective of complicating the type inference algorithm, though. (This is different from the case in the OP in that this is actually type inference, while that's something much simpler: just instantiating type parameters.)\n\nMy personal feeling w.r.t. both of these is that they're interesting possibilities but also tremendously unimportant, i.e.: I don't feel like we need to make a decision either way, we can just note the possibility (as we have) and come back to it (much) later when we don't have way more important things to think about.\n",
