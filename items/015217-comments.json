    "body": "The `[start, stop)` notation is useful.  It'll probably appear elsewhere anyway so you might want to keep it.\n\nHere I tried a different approach though if you will want an example like this here I'm not sure:\n\n```\n// [0,3] -> 0,1,2,3 -> count from 0 to 3 including `[]` 0 and 3\n// (0,3) ->   1,2   -> count from 0 to 3 excluding `()` 0 and 3\n// (0,3] ->   1,2,3 -> combo\n\n// So:\n// [0,7) -> 0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n// [0,3) -> 0,1,2,        -> ends at 3\n// [3,7) ->       3,4,5,6 -> also starts at 3\n\n// Whereas:\n// [0,6] -> 0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n// [0,2] -> 0,1,2,        -> ends at 2\n// [3,6] ->       3,4,5,6 -> starts at 3 which is different from 2\n// Which means with `[start,stop]`, you'll always have to work harder to align ranges\n// because they don't start and end at the same point\n\n// It also means:\n// [2,6) -> 2,3,4,5 -> has 4 (6-2) elements\n// [2,5] -> 2,3,4,5 -> has 4 (5-2+1) elements\n\n// [612, 5244) -> how many elements?\n```\n\nQuestions regarding this notation will probably come up often with new programmers and people used to one based indexing.\n",

I also liked the note above \"over the range [start, stop) (starting at start (inclusive), and ending at stop (exclusive)).\"\n\nHow easy is it to get to this page? My first points of contact were with the tutorial (http://doc.rust-lang.org/tutorial.html) and the reference (http://doc.rust-lang.org/rust.html). I think it could be worth also clarifying the aspects of range in those docs as well, in terms of a couple of examples and a mention about the exclusive nature of the second parameter.\n",
