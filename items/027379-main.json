  "body": "As described in the module documentation, the memory orderings in Rust\nare the same with that of LLVM.  However, the documentation for the\nmemory orderings enum says the memory orderings are the same of that of\nC++.  Note that they differ in that C++'s support the consume reads,\nwhile LLVM's does not.  Hence this commit fixes the bug in the\ndocumentation for the enum.\n",
