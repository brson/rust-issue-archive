  "body": "This PR includes a bunch of refactoring that was part of an experimental branch implementing [implied bounds]. That particular idea isn't ready to go yet, but the refactoring proved useful for fixing #22246. The implied bounds branch also exposed #22110 so a simple fix for that is included here. I still think some more refactoring would be a good idea here -- in particular I think most of the code in wf.rs is kind of duplicating the logic in implicator and should go, but I decided to post this PR and call it a day before diving into that. I'll write a bit more details about the solutions I adopted in the various bugs.\n\nr? @pnkfelix (for now, anyway)\ncc @aturon \n",
