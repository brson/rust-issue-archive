  "body": "Remove derivations of `Copy` trait from `ChaChaRng`, `IsaacRng`, `Isaac64Rng`\nand `StdRng` and implement the `Clone` trait instead.\n\nCopying is an implicit operation and the copy shares its internal state with\nthe original generator. This means the the two generators will yield exactly\nthe same sequence of values. This behaviour is considerably easy to trigger\nby, for example, passing the generator by value to a function.\n\n`Clone` trait, on the other hand, does no implicit copying. The user will only\nbe able to either move the generator or ask for a copy explicitly, via the\n`clone` method.\n\nThe only downside to this patch is the fact that the implementations of\n`Clone::clone` methods do not optimise down to a single memcpy, like the\nderived `Copy` implementations did.\n\nAlthough the `Copy` implementations of these random number generators are\nsuspected to not be used much, this is a [breaking-change].\n\nFixes #20170.\n",
