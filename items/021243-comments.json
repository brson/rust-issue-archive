    "body": "Essentially what should happen here is the following:\n- Each installer needs to contain a `version` file that contains the version. The rustc build already has this file (see code in mk/dist.mk). The Cargo build _also_ needs to produce this file. Finally, [rust-packaging](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-packaging) needs to be modified to copy the one from rustc over to the combined rust+cargo package.\n- Once all our 'products' have version files, modify rust-buildbot's finish_dist method to create the `channel-$product-nightly-data` file.\n\nThis file needs to be parsable from shell scripts so I suggest a simple line-oriented key-value format, maybe like:\n\n```\nmetadata-version: 1\nproduct-version: (whatever the contents of the version file)\narchive-date: (the date in the archives the artifacts are being uploaded to)\n```\n",

The referenced package target is then treated as either a component or extension of the one it is listed by.\n\nThe distinction between `components` and `extensions` seems to be that `components` are installed by default with the referencing target, while `extensions` are not.\n",
