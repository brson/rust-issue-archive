    "body": "This seems pretty awesome to me!\n\nWe'd be putting a large emphasis on the initial attribute name rather than the inner attributes which is the only concern of mine. Right now attributes are consistent in that as you go inside attributes you continue to get more attributes, but this is changing that such that the outermost layer is an enum and the innermost layer is all strings.\n\nI think I'm ok with this, but I'm curious what others' opinions on this are. I'm not entirely convinced that this is a huge win over the unified list inside of `middle::lint` that we have right now, but I could be convinced of such.\n",

    "body": "Right, inner attributes are tricky and I feel quite uncomfortable to use `contains_attr` for outmost attribute but `contains_name` for inner ones.\n\nI initially thought of adding some fields to `DefinedAttr` as like:\n\n```\npub enum DefinedAttr {\n    AttrCrateType(bool), // is_lib\n    AttrFeature(~[AttrFeatureItem]), // enum AttrFeatureItem { Globs, MacroRules, ... }\n    AttrNoUv, // no arg\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nand some function parsing `MetaItem` to `Option<DefinedAttr>`. But it seems too complex to use (`contains_attr` must be changed somehow).\n\nAlternatively, we may just define e.g. `AttrFeatureItem` and use `contains_attr(feature_attr.meta_item_list(), MacroRules)` for `feature(macro_rules)`.\n",
