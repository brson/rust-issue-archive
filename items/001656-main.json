  "body": "- When specifying enable-llvm, it still uses gcc to build llvm.\n  Adding a condition, let clang do that work.\n- If system has installed llvm and specifies include paths in the CFLAGS, it may fail to link rustllvm.\n  In freebsd's case, 3rd-party libs are installed in /usr/local, so we have to add extra paths to find them.\n  When compiling rustllvm, it looks up /usr/local/include/llvm/Config/Targets.def not bundled llvm.\n  That causes RustWrapper.o contains nonexistent symbols, so I replace -I with -iquote to ensure that include paths of LLVM_CXXFLAGS comes before CFLAGS.\n",
