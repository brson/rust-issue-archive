    "body": "`git grep -C 5 'C_struct'` shows a few instances of `C_struct(...)` seemingly without a corresponding `C_packed_struct`, although I guess many are related to enums rather than structs.\n\n(FWIW, it seems like it would be reasonable to just merge `C_struct` and `C_packed_struct` with a `packed: bool` parameter; it'd certainly make bugs like this less common if the author has to think about what to put there.)\n",
