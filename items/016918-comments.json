    "body": "DSTifying `PartialEq`, `PartialOrd` causes lots of breakage.\n\nThe reason is that, for example, `PartialEq` is currently implemented for `&'a [T]`, so `eq` has signature `fn eq(&self, other: & &'a [T])`. But, once you DSTify it, `eq`'s signature changes to `fn eq(&self, other: &[T])` , so the RHS now needs one less level of indirection. And, because of how the operator sugar works, the RHS of the operator now needs to be an unsized array `[T]` or `str`.\n\nThe following patterns break:\n- `a[..] == b[..]`: Fixed by changing it to `a[..] == *b[..]`\n- `a[..].partial_cmp(&b[..])`: Fixed by changing it to `a[..].partial_cmp(b[..])`\n- `#[deriving(PartialEq]`/`#[deriving(PartialOrd]` on structs that contain either `&str`/`&[T]`: `error: mismatched types: expected`&str`, found`&&'static str`\n- `s == \"abc\"`: Fixed by changing it to `s == *\"abc\"`\n- `s == [b'i', b'n', b'f']`: `error: mismatched types: expected`[u8]`, found`[u8, ..3]`(expected unsized array, found array)`\n- Everything that applies to `==`, applies to other operators.\n\nI'll skip those traits for now.\n",

    "body": "@aturon I've got other branches where I've DSTified other 4 traits, all them need a newer snapshot (#18259) that includes #18121. Could you review them? Here are the branches + some remarks:\n- [`Show`](https://github.com/japaric/rust/commits/show)\n  - This one was rather trivial nothing else to say here\n- [`Hash`](https://github.com/japaric/rust/commits/hash)\n  - This one changed the signature of `*_equiv` methods from e.g. `find_equiv(&\"Hello\")` to `find_equiv(\"Hello\")`, so some stuff broke.\n  - I left a FIXME about adding a test for hashing `Box<str>`, because there is no way to create that type at the moment (see #18283).\n  - I also left a FIXME for adding `Sized?` to the `Rc<T>` impl, because e.g. `Rc<[T]>` is not yet allowed (see #18248).\n- [`ToCStr`](https://github.com/japaric/rust/commits/tocstr)\n  - There was this [FIXME message](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e2cd4597dae1ed0aa3967bd2a656a42daa1ad27f/src/librustrt/c_str.rs#L332) saying that we should take `ToCStr` implementors by reference instead of by value, so I went ahead with that.\n    - This broke stuff like `Command::new(path)`, which needs to be changed to `Command::new(&path)`.\n    - Note that methods like `Command::new(\"foo\")` still work.\n  - I've to kept the `impl ToCStr for &'a str` because of `Command::args`, one of the uses is `cmd.args([\"Hello\", \"World\"])` where `args` has signature `fn args<'a, T: ToCStr>(&'a mut self, args: &[T]) -> &'a mut Command`, in that case `T` has to be `&str`\n- [`BytesContainer`](https://github.com/japaric/rust/commits/bytes)\n  - As with `ToCStr` I changed some methods from taking the `BytesContainer` implementors by value to taking them by reference. This broke some stuff.\n  - Since `BytesContainer` has two methods (`container_into_owned_bytes` and `is_str`) that take the receiver by value, so I split the trait in two: `BytesContainer for Sized?` and `SizedBytesContainer: BytesContainer + Sized`, but see below.\n    - It seems that the `container_into_owned_bytes` method is not used anywhere so we could just remove it, and\n    - There is only one use of the `is_str` method but AFAICT is not necessary, so we could remove this method as well, therefore\n    - if those two methods are removed then we can remove the `SizedBytesContainer` trait as well.\n\nEach branch passes `make check` locally but I may have forgotten to fix some Windows/*BSD tests since I can't run those.\n",

    "body": "@japaric @Gankro what I'm most concerned about is that, currently, we do a kind of odd-ball search when looking up operators. e.g., if we have `l + r`, where the types of `l` and `r` are `L` and `R`, I just want to search for `Add<L,R>`, rather than doing a traditional method search (which involves auto-ref, coercion, and other considerations). This does mean that in some cases we might wind up writing \"convenience\" impls for things like `String` compared with `&str` that basically encode common coercions. But I think it's more predictable overall. Today I whippe up a [prototype](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust/tree/operator-dispatch) of this approach, though it doesn't quite build yet. One obstacle is the current `Eq` and `Ord` traits which do not permit comparison between two distinct types for some reason.\n",

I'm not quite sure how the desugaring works for fixed-sized arrays but I think that `&[0u8, 1]` is being treated as `&[u8, ..2]` instead of being coerced as `&[u8]`.\n",

    "body": "@japaric I am indeed working on cleaning up this code and I actually encountered a similar issue. I think I do know yes what the problem is, though I have to confirm. It has to do with the specifics of when coercions occur and under what conditions. Basically I think what happens (at least in my branch) is that we match the receiver as `[u8]` but then we type-check the argument, which has type `[u8, ..2]` and we expect `[u8]`. We probably ought to be checking the autoref'd type of the argument (`&[u8, ..2]`) and comparing that to the expected type with ref, `&[u8]`. This would make the coercion work. I will look into doing that on my branch. The branch is getting very close, shooting for PR today.\n",

According to my analysis, this is what's left to be done:\n- Remove `AnyRefExt` and `AnyMutRefExt` in favor of a trait implementation (`impl Any { }`). I tried this but hit #19055 and #19056.\n- Decide if we want to be able to `Pointer` format `&str`/`&T`/`&mut T`. I didn't try but I think implementing this will get blocked by #17167\n- Remove `impl Equiv for &mut [T]`, nothing in the repository uses it. I already tested removing this and passed `make check`.\n\nDo look at the table, and let me know if you think I missed anything.\n",
