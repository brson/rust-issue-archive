It's the same span for all the lines, too, so the backtraces are redundant.\n\nI suspect the fix is for `fileline_note` and `fileline_help` to omit the macro backtrace.\n\nI'm also wondering about the first `span_note` call in `rustc_typeck::check::method::suggest::report_error`.  Why isn't it `fileline_note`?\n\nAlso: `ExtCtxt::print_backtrace` was added in 2011-08-05 and reduced to a no-op ten days later.  I think I'm going to remove it.  Probably needs a separate PR.\n",
