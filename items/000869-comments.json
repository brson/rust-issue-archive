    "body": "Without nominal records, it's unclear how to introduce a record literal that has a constrained type. There are also some notes at https://github.com/graydon/rust/wiki/Constrained-types that explain some of the relevant thinking further. With nominal records, the constructor for a record that has a constrained type is analogous to a function with constraints on its arguments, and that way we have constrained types.\n\nSuppose we didn't have nominal records -- consider the record literal `{x: 5, y:6}`. What is the type of this record? `{x: int, y:int}`? Or, with constraints: `{x:int, y:int} : odd(x), even(y)`? Or {x:int, y:int} : lt(x, 6), lt(y, 7)`? Or... of course, an infinite number of possible types. Restricting constrained types to have a nominal record type as their base type lets us assign a unique type to any record literal.\n",
