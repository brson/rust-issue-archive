    "body": "When merging this with #6093, I went ahead and made these a bit more specific. It's not always the case that `-W` should be in front from what I could tell. There's three different cases of source emission now:\n- The lint level was by default, and the message has `[(warn|forbid|deny) by default]`\n- The lint level was set by the command line, and the appended message is `[-(W|D|F) lint-name]`\n- The lint level was set by some attribute, in which case a `span_note` is emitted with the source of the lint source.\n\nDoes that sound ok to you?\n",
