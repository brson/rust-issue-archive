    "body": "Apparently Rust already uses a few patches on LLVM; adding another one is _probably_ not that bad.\n\nI think the best way for this to be handled is for there to be some way to indicate \"malloc-y stuff\" to LLVM; currently, LLVM is just hardcoded. The easiest change would just be replacing \"malloc\" with \"je_mallocx\", and \"free\" with \"je_sdallocx\", but removing the hardcoding entirely (and contributing that back to LLVM upstream) is probably ideal.\n\nIt's arguable that this is actually LLVM's issue, but because we are already not using \"stock\" LLVM, it may be worth it to diverge a little further from LLVM master.\n\nI'm not sure how jemalloc could pretend to be malloc, because the APIs are different; from what I saw of LLVM's code, it checks both the function name and the signature. Any wins from better optimization here are unlikely to be worth giving up sized deallocation and alignment, for example.\n",

    "body": "@XMPPwocky Please put this in a PR! The fix is so simple, we can safely apply it to our branch. It solves the here-and-now problem, it doesn't require us to address custom allocators first, and it doesn't fundamentally change the language\u2014just the optimization capabilities of our implementation. It can even be applied to a future stable release like LLVM 3.6, should that happen before Rust 1.0. True, the librustc available from rust-lang.org wouldn't be statically linked against an unmodified, stable release of LLVM, but the gains speak for themselves.\n",
