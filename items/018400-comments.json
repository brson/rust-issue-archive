    "body": "@japaric what happens is that the compiler tries to determine if the `impl` applies to the type of the integral literal `S`. At that point it hasn't processed the arguments of the method call (we need to resolve the method before processing the arguments so we can provide type hints and so forth), and thus it actually only knows that the element type is some variable (let's call it `$0`).\n\nIt seems an impl that says \"`Set<&T>` applies if S is a type that implements `Set<T>`\", so it assumes that maybe `$0=&$1` and goes off to look for an impl of `Set<$1>`. But this is just where we started, basically. (We were looking for an impl of `Set<$0>.) So we wind up repeating the same reasoning ad infinitum.\n",
