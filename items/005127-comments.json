I thought he was talking about something related to\nthe bors comment, \"merging tmmcguire/rust/faster_each_permutation =\ndba7f6d into auto failed\".\n\nTo tell the truth, I don't know whether it ought to fail or not, either,\nbut failing does make debugging uses of it easier. :-)\n\n## \n\nTommy M.
