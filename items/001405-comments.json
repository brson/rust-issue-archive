The thinking is that calling unsupervise indicates that you're expected failure, which makes sense. But it could be that you have a hierarchy of tasks, with only the root of that heirarchy being unsupervised. In that case, you still might expect the children to fail, because you're counting on their parent being unsupervised, in which case we would still see a bunch of log messages.\n",
