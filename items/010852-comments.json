So if/when I make that change, `DList` and `RingBuf` won't have that O(n) overhead to push a value on the front of the sequence. So I think it'd be helpful to have a more general purpose name. I think it's fair to say that `.push_front()` and `.pop_back()` might not be the right names, so I'll do a survey into what other languages are using.\n",

(This is one of the advantages of traits over templates: you don't have to choose your method names up front to match all possible scenarios where the type could be used for a generic instantiation.)\n\nI would think for a particular data-type, you should choose names that convey each methods behavior (in terms of effect, time expense, etc).\n\nAnd then for the unified trait, you would choose names that focus on the end-to-end effect, because the trait presumably won't dictate constraints on O(1) versus O(n), unless it does. :)\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis: I'd be fine with that decision. If we do that, then I would suggest that deque-like structures should then get a special python-ish `push_front/pop_front` and keep `push/pop` for operations at the end of the structure. So that'd work out to be:\n\n```\ntrait MutableSeq<T> {\n    fn push(&mut self, t: T);\n    fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T>;\n    fn insert(&mut self, idx: uint, t: T);\n    fn remove(&mut self, idx: uint) -> Option<T>;\n    ...\n}\n\ntrait MutableDeque<T>: MutableSeq<T> {\n    fn push_front(&mut self, t: T);\n    fn pop_front(&mut self) -> Option<T>;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nAlthough `MutableSeq` could be broken up some more. I'm tempted to copy C++ STL and have a `FrontInsertionSeq` and `BackInsertionSeq`, but that might be getting a little silly.\n\nAlso, before anyone implements this, I've got a WIP patch that implements most of this, so I'll take care of doing any renaming if/when we decide what to rename.\n",

It can be some `Queue` trait, including most of the classical collection as stacks and `extra::priority_queue` will propose that trait.\n",
