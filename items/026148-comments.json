Granted, some of the changes are for hosting Rust (and LLVM) in PNaCl and so aren't strictly needed for targeting.\n\nThat said, you're right in that it could be refactored better. I just pushed such a refactor.\n\n> For example what's your setup look like to get this working?\n\nThis PR won't work currently. While `pnacl-llvm` has been merged with upstream LLVM 3.7, `pepper-canary` doesn't yet reflect the merge, so none of this will work (I've been informed that the merge caused bugs outside LLVM's testsuite, which is why it hasn't made it into `pepper_canary`). Once it does, one would configure with:\n\n``` sh\n./configure --target=le32-unknown-nacl --nacl-cross-path=$NACL_SDK_ROOT\n```\n\nWhere `$NACL_SDK_ROOT` points to the canary version from `nacl_sdk`, ie: `/opt/nacl_sdk/pepper_canary`.\n\n> Are you using a custom LLVM and how are you configuring/building it?\n\nOnce accepted and once `pepper_canary` has LLVM > 3.7, this port will use the LLVM in the PNaCl toolchain.\n",

    "body": "Hm OK, looking over the patch again this seems like a more serious investment than we may want for porting to a new architecture. I haven't taken the time to fully understand all the changes yet, but this is a _huge_ amount of \"if pnacl { ... } else { ... }\", especially when it comes to codegen. \n\nI think that if we want to land this support in-tree then there needs to be a much less invasive way for the compiler to deal with platform-specific differences. For example when adding MSVC support instead of duplicating the entire `link_args` function I instead created a `Linker` trait which is implemented for GNU/MSVC separately, and there's only one point in the code which decides which to use. Custom target specifications can go a long way here to have all the various options in the spec instead of the compiler itself.\n\nThis also needs to be **very** conservative when adding options to the compiler, ideally it should add 0 new items. This looks like it's adding, however a `-C cross-path` option and a `#[main_link_name]` attribute at least.\n\nFinally, I'd like to understand a little more why there's such an overwhelming amount of pnacl-specific code. Why does the standard process that all other platforms use need to differ so much on pnacl? Is the toolchain just fundamentally different?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton \n\n> I haven't taken the time to fully understand all the changes yet, but this is a huge amount of \"if pnacl { ... } else { ... }\", especially when it comes to codegen.\n\nW.r.t codegen: PNaCl doesn't have a target machine, so there's no codegen to do. As for the nasty hack in trans which makes `type_is_immediate` return false based on the LLVM type, it's only there so Rust generates function sigs like Clang which is what the PNaCl IR simplification passes are designed to work with. At any rate, I'm currently working on two new passes that'll handle Rust's liberal use of immediate aggregate types in function signatures. I can remove that specific haxor once they're complete.\n\n> This also needs to be very conservative when adding options to the compiler, ideally it should add 0 new items. This looks like it's adding, however a -C cross-path option and a #[main_link_name] attribute at least.\n\nI share your reluctance, however those two additions are required. `-C cross-path` is needed so `rustc` can run the toolchain's bitcode linker (can't use the system gold linker if the user has it, too) with the toolchain's LLVMgold plugin. `#[main_link_name]` is needed to work with `nacl_spawn` from `naclports` because `nacl_spawn` defines `main` and calls `nacl_main` after initializing Stuff (like stdio piping via JS or `fork`). Ie (EDIT: accidentally put \"nacl_spawn\" instead of the correct \"nacl_main\"):\n\n``` rust\n#[cfg_attr(target_os = \"nacl\", main_link_name = \"nacl_main\")]\nfn main() {}\n\n#[cfg(target_os = \"nacl\")]\n#[link(name = \"ppapi_cpp\", kind = \"static\")]\n#[link(name = \"ppapi_simple_cpp\", kind = \"static\")]\n#[link(name = \"ppapi_stub\", kind = \"static\")]\n#[link(name = \"cli_main\", kind = \"static\")]\n#[link(name = \"tar\", kind = \"static\")]\n#[link(name = \"nacl_spawn\", kind = \"static\")]\nextern { }\n```\n\nTechnically, there needs to be another option to tell `rustc` to emit a stable Pexe. (EDIT: grammar and sentence structure fail) I work around it by writing out a separate bitcode file with debugging info first, and then stripping for final Pexe output.\n\n> Finally, I'd like to understand a little more why there's such an overwhelming amount of pnacl-specific code. Why does the standard process that all other platforms use need to differ so much on pnacl? Is the toolchain just fundamentally different?\n\nThe models for other platforms are actually pretty similar to PNaCl's. The big differences are the addition of the IR simplification passes after linking, no codegen-ing, and the bitcode writer used. Nonetheless however, the changes present in ie [`src/librustc_trans/back/write.rs`](https://github.com/DiamondLovesYou/rust/blob/libstd-pnacl/src/librustc_trans/back/write.rs) are an optimization that deals with behaviour of `pnacl-clang(++)` (note: `pnacl-clang` is a wrapper around the actual `clang`). There's a comment in that file explaining why:\n\n``` rust\n// In contrast to the NaCl SDK PNaCl toolchain, we do things a little\n// differently.\n// `pnacl-clang` or `pnacl-ld` run all optimization passes (set by\n// -O[0-3sz]) after linking. This isn't such a problem when you have a\n// compiler (ie clang) that generates reasonably sized modules to begin\n// with, or when you don't have a test suite with 1500+ separate binary\n// tests that you'd like to run and complete sometime before you\n// retire. Rust isn't so lucky.\n// So to make things more manageable, Rust runs the optimization passes\n// on each of its modules as per usual, and uses LLVM's LTO passes for,\n// well, LTO, with the IR simplification passes before and\n// after. However, `pnacl-clang`s behavior is unchanged, which means we\n// need to run the regular optimization passes on the current crate's\n// link deps.\n```\n\nAnd in [`src/librustc_trans/back/link.rs`](https://github.com/DiamondLovesYou/rust/blob/libstd-pnacl/src/librustc_trans/back/link.rs):\n\n``` rust\n// Note that we don't use pnacl-ld here. We want to avoid the costly post-link\n// simplification passes pnacl-ld runs (it runs -O *post link*). Instead,\n// since pnacl-ld's output is just bitcode, what we do here is pull all of\n// our 'native' dependencies into a (very large) module and, if requested,\n// run the LTO passes on it.\n```\n\nPart of the reason why I've used separate paths for PNaCl is because I originally started this work a year and a half ago: many things that are now just config items were hard coded (dylibs is one example). That isn't an issue now of course, however even with the shortcuts outlined above, the `le32-unknown-nacl` test suite still takes HOURS alone.\n\n@brson \n\n> Perhaps some of these big conditionally-compiled blocks of code can be factored into their own files where they can be generally ignored by other developers.\n\nThat can certainly be arranged. Alex has already pointed to the backtracing routines; do you have any other suggestions?\n\n> I'm also curious about the new `target_libc` attribute and what kind of ramifications it will have for downstream crates that aren't aware of it.\n\nThat is not a new attribute, it's added by `mk/cfg/le32-unknown-nacl.mk`:\n\n```\nRUSTC_CROSS_FLAGS_le32-unknown-nacl=-C cross-path=$(CFG_NACL_CROSS_PATH) --cfg \"target_libc=\\\"newlib\\\"\" -L $(CFG_NACL_CROSS_PATH)/lib/pnacl/Release -L $(CFG_NACL_CROSS_PATH)/toolchain/$(NACL_TOOLCHAIN_OS_PATH)_pnacl/lib/clang/3.6.0/lib/le32-nacl -L $(CFG_NACL_CROSS_PATH)/toolchain/$(NACL_TOOLCHAIN_OS_PATH)_pnacl/le32-nacl/usr/lib\n```\n\nAnd, frankly, I think it's utility is dubious.\n",

We've gone through several arrangements for passing this kind of info to rustc (I actually already thought we had something for this).\n\nIn the past, Android's cross used it as well. It was removed around a year ago (was mildly annoying for me when it happened too).\n\nEither way, `rustc` will also check for `$NACL_SDK_ROOT` (because `cargo`) if `-C cross-path` isn't specified.\n",
