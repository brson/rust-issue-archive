    "body": "So, one question about this overall approach: it seems to assume that the first error in the chain is at a \"lower level\" of abstraction than the second (if you think of `FromError` as raising the abstraction level). I'm not sure whether that's justified.\n\nIn particular, for the `try!` macro it's often the case that you have several different kinds of errors being produced in a fn body, all of which lift out to a single kind of \"outer\" error, rather than converting into one another.\n\nI'm curious whether you've thought about supporting this more general use case? It seems like it would complicate the signatures significantly, and possibly hurt type inference more, but I'd still like to see what it looks like.\n",
