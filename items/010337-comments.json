    "body": "It occurs to me that if we make these changes we could avoid the need to know the type of `x` in `x + 1`. Basically we could just call it a plain trait match, and then add lang items for the built-in additions (`x + 1` etc). Essentially _all_ operators would be overloaded. The usual reason we haven't done this is that operations on ints and so forth are privileged in that they can appear in constant expressions. But there is no reason that we can't say that operations in constant expressions must resolve to lang items. It would also simplify a lot of other code if _all_ operators were considered overloaded (up until trans, where I imagine we'd inline `+` and so forth rather than leaning on LLVM for that).\n",
