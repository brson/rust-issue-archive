Both the parent and the child would initialize it.\n- The constructor `Thread::new` should perhaps not use 0 as the default as this means `thread::current` on every non-rust-spawned thread will have an id of 0 I believe.\n\nI'm also not sure that we want to use the exact same ID as the underlying OS. As @nagisa points out we can't rely on `pthread_t` being an integer, so there may not always be an ID to assign.\n",
