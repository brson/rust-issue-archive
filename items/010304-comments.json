    "body": "This has been proposed numerous times. I think it's a great idea. I couldn't find another issue though I'm sure one or two exists -- or maybe not. Here is a generalization: generate a warning if you create a variable that has the same name as a variant of the enum being matched (note that this variant name may be lower case). I actually think it'd possibly make sense to have both warnings, but checking for variables with the same name as an (unimported) variant seems more targeted.\n",
