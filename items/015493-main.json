  "body": "This updates https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15075.\n\nRename `ToStr::to_str` to `ToString::to_string`. The naive renaming ends up with two `to_string` functions defined on strings in the prelude (the other defined via `collections::str::StrAllocating`). To remedy this I removed `StrAllocating::to_string`, making all conversions from `&str` to `String` go through `Show`. This has a measurable impact on the speed of this conversion, but the sense I get from others is that it's best to go ahead and unify `to_string` and address performance for all `to_string` conversions in `core::fmt`. `String::from_str(...)` still works as a manual fast-path.\n\nNote that the patch was done with a script, and ended up renaming a number of other `*_to_str` functions, particularly inside of rustc. All the ones I saw looked correct, and I didn't notice any additional API breakage.\n\nCloses #15046.\n",
