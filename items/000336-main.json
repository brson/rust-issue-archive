  "body": "Lots of work on typestate_check, seems to get a lot of the way\nthrough checking the standard library.\n- Added for, for_each, assign_op, bind, cast, put, check, break,\n  and cont. (I'm not sure break and cont are actually handled correctly.)\n- Fixed side-effect bug in seq_preconds so that unioning the\n  preconditions of a sequence of statements or expressions\n  is handled correctly.\n- Pass poststate correctly through a stmt_decl.\n- Handle expr_ret and expr_fail properly (after execution of a ret\n  or fail, everything is true -- this is needed to handle ifs and alts\n  where one branch is a ret or fail)\n- Fixed bug in set_prestate_ann where a thing that needed to be\n  mutated wasn't getting passed as an alias\n- Fixed bug in how expr_alt was treated (zero is not the identity\n  for intersect, who knew, right?)\n- Update logging to reflect log_err vs. log\n- Fixed find_locals so as to return all local decls and exclude\n  function arguments.\n- Make union_postconds work on an empty vector (needed to handle\n  empty blocks correctly)\n- Added _vec.cat_options, which takes a list of option[T] to a list\n  of T, ignoring any Nones\n- Added two test cases.\n",
