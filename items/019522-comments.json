    "body": "@cmr: I mainly submitted this PR for feedback on the approach I have taken. This PR fixes the issue for the Single Import case, while Globs still give the same \"unresolved import\" error, which I haven't yet looked into. \n\nDo you think my current approach is fine (i.e globs will be handled within resolve_glob_import) or should I think about doing the check at a higher level (perhaps [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/resolve.rs#L2451)).\n\nFWIW, although I can't confirm it yet, I believe even if we moved the check to a higher level, we need to perform the same kinds of checks performed in the individual functions if the error message needs to be something like \"type/value/module x conflicts y\". However if the error message is generic like \"can't import from the same module\", without listing specific conflicts, we can just do the check and bailout at the higher level. \n\nEDIT: cc'ing @nick29581 \n",
