    "body": "It seems this is nice to have but needs to work very differently:\n- It should extract the exponent from the float and definitely not use a loop\n- It should handle positive exponents\n- It should handle denormals\n- It should handle infinities and NaNs and thus return `Option<Ratio<BigInt>>` or maybe `ExtendedNumber<Ratio<BigInt>>` with `enum ExtendedNumber<T> {NaN, Infinity(bool), Finite(T)}`.\n- It should call Ratio::new_raw after normalizing internally by calling trailing_zeros() on the mantissa instead of using gcd in Ratio::new() since that's faster when the gcd is always a power of 2\n\nAlso, it might make sense to preserve the sign of floating point zeros by making Ratio::reduce no longer force the denominator to be positive, but I'm not sure if this causes issues elsewhere.\n",

It uses continued fractions, which would imply that it's going to be close to the closest rational to the input float for a given upper bound on the denominator; I would suggest that allowing specifying an optional upper bound would be good too, either via `max_denom: Option<&BigInt>` or a separate method.\n",

    "body": "I did a bit of research last week about how other programming languages deal with float to ratio conversion.\n\nI let them ran with 0.1 and 3.14159265359:\n\nThe results were:\nPython, Ruby, Java, Haskell, Go:\n\n```\n0.1: 3602879701896397/36028797018963968\n3.14159265359: 3537118876014453/1125899906842624\n```\n\nLisp (SBCL), GMP (through Python binding):\n\n```\n0.1: 1/10\n3.14159265359: 226883371/72219220\n```\n\nNote that Lisp has the distinction between `rational` and `rationalize`. The difference\nis the performance. `rational` returns the same result as the other programming languages,\nwhere `rationalize` is slower but returns the same as GMP.\n\nI currently learn towards following the Lisp route and implementing a `rational` as\nwell as a `rationalize` function for `float`.\n\nI'm sorry that I don't remember the name, but I'd like to thank the person that gave me the idea of looking into the Lisp implementation (it was at the last Rust meetup in Mountain View).\n",

    "body": "That looks cool, although the shifts seems to be prone to overflow, e.g. changing `let f = <pi>` to `let f = let f = 2f64.pow(&100.);` gives `0/1`, presumably because [`mantissa << exponent`](https://gist.github.com/vmx/7521098#file-gistfile1-txt-L39) overflows (this is actually undefined behaviour for LLVM too); I think it should do something like `from_i64(sign as i64 * mantissa as i64) << exponent` (or whatever casting on needs to do to get that to typecheck). Similarly for the `1 << (1 - exponent)` ones below.\n\nAlso, `integer_decode_float` seems to depend on IEEE754 floats; I don't know if Rust (and/or LLVM) mandates this. (It would be very reasonable to.)\n",
