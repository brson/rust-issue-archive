    "body": "Thanks for the PR!\n\nThis is currently intentionally left out as working with `rtio` isn't intended for general use (unlike `std::io`). That being said, the structure of I/O is being rearchitected by @aturon, and it's likely that this sort of discrepancy will just go away in the future. \n\nA few notes:\n- Typically PRs like this are only one commit (you can squash commits in git), and the commit message matches the PR description in the sense that the first line is a summary and the remaining lines are details about the change.\n- The current format being printed is fairly different from other `Show` implementations today. Perhaps something like:\n\n``` rust\nimpl fmt::Show for IoError {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {\n        try!(write!(f, \"os error {}\"));\n        match self.detail { Some(ref s) => try!(write!(f, \" ({})\", s)); None => {} }\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt's probably ok to ignore `extra` because it's only used for short writes currently.\n",
