Additionally, as you pointed out, this is that the `-L` flag is for.\n\nIdeally you wouldn't need to specify paths to search for libraries in, I believe that `rustpkg` is able to automatically set this via the `RUST_PATH` environment variable (@catamorphism would know more on the topic of that)\n",
