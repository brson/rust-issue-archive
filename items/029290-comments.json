Is it possible that these two outputs are compatible for both processors because it is such a simple program (467kb still!!)?  I wouldn't expect it to run so otherwise I assume that it's not targeting the right processor.\n",

    "body": "Yes unfortunately it's a [known problem](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/5258) right now that you can't bootstrap the compiler for a target which you can't yourself run locally (e.g. nothing other than i686 -> x86_64 or vice versa works).\n\nWe've actually just recently started to produce [artifacts for the standard library](http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-std-nightly-arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi.tar.gz) (you can see [more as well](http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/)) and the tooling will soon be updated to help you install those locally! It means you'll have to have a cross compiler available (and won't be able to run rustc itself on the device), but it should at least get some of the way there.\n\nAs this is tracked elsewhere, though, I'm going to close for now.\n",
