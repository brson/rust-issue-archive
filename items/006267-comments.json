I'm willing to do so, but I have no idea where it should go (in the manual presumably, but which section?).\n",

    "body": "The problem is that the checkfast procedure does not generate a `use core` at the top of the combined program that it generates. This is not really a concern of this PR in particular, but it'd be simple enough to fix. I am inclined to think, as a separate issue, that `use core` ought to be in the prelude. In any case, rather than JUST xfail-fasting them, can we put a comment as well explaining why? Potentially we could open an issue for this problem as well.\n",
