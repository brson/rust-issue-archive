    "body": "Yeah issue 0 == \"this probably won't ever be stabilized\",  and FnBox currently falls into that category (it's just a stopgap for now). Otherwise we don't require issues on deprecated features (as the decision on that feature is already made).\n\nFinally, the feature names specific are a bit nebulous but it's not intended that all features pointing at the same issue have the exact same feature name. We still want the ability to move things around and stabilize subsets if possible.\n\nFor now I believe these are all intentional, though, so closing, but thanks for doing the audit!\n",

Seems like it ought to point at #18424 (unless EnumSet has been dropped since then? Pretty old RFC).\n- \"core_simd\" in libcore/simd_old has no issue. Should it point at rust-lang/rfcs#1199 or is this file just outdated?\n",
