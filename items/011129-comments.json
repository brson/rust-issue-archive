    "body": "I'm a little worried about this patch. This introduces _a lot_ of call to `unwrap()`, which is in theory supposed to be an antipattern. It's possible that it's just too much of a pain to alter all the code that uses these functions right now, but I am afraid of promoting the `unwrap()` methodology in real programs because of these api changes. It seems marginally better than failure in a library because we can at least say \"you were asking for it\", but I'm also uncomfortable in that we don't have a solution for problems like this.\n\nIn general this seems like an improvement, but I think this warrants discussion to ensure that this it the direction that we want to go in. It would be sad for `unwrap()` to become rust's \"null pointer problem\", but that definitely seems to be where it's headed right now.\n",
