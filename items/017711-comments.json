    "body": "A few notes about this PR: ultimately it's not clear whether the `Str` and `AsSlice` traits should continue to exist, but it's also not clear whether the `[]` notation is going to stick around (depending on deref and coercion decisions).\n\nAlso, at the moment removing `Str` and `AsSlice` in favor of `ops::Slice` is painful due to staging issues: everywhere we call `as_slice` we'd have to call `as_slice_` instead.\n\nThis PR therefore is the smallest delta that deals with the basic regression. After it lands, we'll need to figure out a real solution for these problems.\n",
