    "body": "This is an artifact of the current implementation which is entirely housed in librustc_resolve. The resolution pass collects all traits which could be _candidates_ for a function call, and then it relies on type checking later on to figure out which trait was actually used. All candidates, however, are considered \"used imports\" and the typechecking phase doesn't later come along and say \"oh I didn't actually use this trait\".\n\nThis may be difficult and/or invasive to fix.\n",
