    "body": "@stevencanfield thanks for the PR and sorry it took me a while to get to it (I've been travelling). There's a couple of good fixes here that I'd like to take, but the formatting of code in doc comments is a known problem with rustfmt and I think we should not land them. The raw string changes are interesting - I'm not sure if they are an improvement or not - do you have an opinion? I filed a rustfmt issue in any case. I was thinking that since the lines after the first are not indented, nor should the first be, but it is indented by the `r\"` so there is no alignment anyway. @pnkfelix what do you think?\n",
