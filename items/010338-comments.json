Possible API:\n\n``` rust\n// Actual number in a string, to avoid tokenizing issues\nbase!(12, \"1ab\")\nbase!(1, \"111111\")\n// Option to separate individual digits with a comma\n// (similar to how sexagesimal digits were written by the Babylonians)\n// thus avoiding an arbitrary maximum base. Individual digits written in\n// the natively supported bases (2, 8, 10, 16)\nbase!(64, \"10,32,17\")\n// Possible idea of where to stick the type ascription\nbase!(64, \"32\", u32)\n// Also could work with floating point literals\n// (although those actually have a clear use case\n// and probably should be added in a non-syntax extension manner)\nbase!(16, \"0x1.fffffffffffffp+1023\", f32)\n```\n\nThe floating point literal syntax was taken from #1433.\n",
