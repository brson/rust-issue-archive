    "body": "That's actually a good point about freestanding functions vs methods. While I think that it's kinda convenient to be able to say `path.open()` it's not clear what exactly you're opening, so it's probably a good idea to put the `file` module in front of names.\n\nOn the other hand, it's pretty nice being able to say `path.is_dir()` and `path.stat()`. How about all read-only functions (querying about stat info basically) remain only as methods, except for `file::stat` being a function as well. Otherwise all actual modification functions become top-level functions. I believe that this means the list would be:\n- open\n- create\n- open_stream\n- rmdir\n- mkdir\n- rename\n- copy\n- unlink\n- remove_dir_recursive\n- make_dir_recursive\n- readdir\n\nThere's a few inconsistencies that I also see when looking over things:\n- There are a number of extra conditions raised in all the method versions of the top-level functions. I think that this is a case for merging them into one top-level function\n- It's odd to have `rmdir`, but `remove_dir_recursive`, these should have a unified name (same for `mkdir`)\n",
