    "body": "We also have to figure out _where_ exactly to run `mergefunc` in the list of passes and #8957 will determine whether it leaves behind stubs.\n\nIf we run it early, we'll save on compile-time, and if we run it after optimizations we'll save more on code size. I'm sure how much `mergefunc` itself is going to cost yet. The big decision is whether to run it before or after the function passes. Of course, this could also vary based on optimization level.\n",
