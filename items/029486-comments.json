    "body": "So does the `_` pattern work as a `..` pattern now? I feel such a change might need an RfC.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm too happy about the change either, from a language point of view. I feel that `_` and `..` are very different in intention: The first means that \"I know there is a field here, but I don't care about it\", the second means \"I only care about the specified fields\". Which sounds the same, but isn't -- it's got the same nuanced distinction between an exhaustive match with noop arms and a match with a wildcard.\n\nWhen you use `_`, you're saying you don't care about that specific field. When you use `..`, you're saying you don't care about that specific field _and_ any other fields which may be added in the future. Just like how the exhaustive match with noop arms means that \"I don't care about these variants\", and a match with a wildcard means \"I don't care about these variants and any variants which may be added in the future\".\n",

    "body": "I would have liked to accept only the change to the HIR and not change the AST. There is no requirement that the HIR can be round-tripped via pretty printing or even that pretty printed HIR is compilable, so simplification there is welcome. However, it is a goal of the AST to be as close as possible to the source text - if there is different source text (which is the case here) then this should be reflected in the AST. I expect the AST to move more in this direction in the future (one could imagine a syntax extension which adds semantic differences here where there are none in Rust).\n\nI'd prefer to see the AST change reversed (unless I'm misunderstanding), but it is pretty minor, so I don't think it is too important for now (I expect that we will revamp the AST in the future anyway).\n",

    "body": "@petrochenkov \"supposed\" is hard to answer because the role of the AST is in flux. In the past it was used by the frontend, tools, syntax extensions, and the compiler so there was a trade-off between being easy to parse, easy to operate on syntactically, and concise so the compiler can operate on it most easily. We have no separated out the AST and HIR so the HIR can be optimised for the compiler and maximally concise (this PR being an example of exactly the kind of change I want to see in the HIR). While the AST is focussed more on being easily usable in tools and syntax extensions - that means (I think) being closer to the source text than it is currently (for example, I want to be able to find comments in the AST). Pretty printing is one example of a tool that needs close correspondence between the AST and source. So, I would like to aim for '100%' correspondence between the source and AST even though that is not the current state, nor has it been a goal in the past.\n\nNote on '100%' and trailing separators. I haven't thought in detail about how the AST should represent these kind of details - I don't think comments should be _in_ the AST, and nor should trailing separators (probably). I am considering some kind of model where we keep the token stream around and support easy indexing of the token stream from the AST (we would also move all span info to the token stream and out of the AST). Then that kind of syntactic trivia is not in the AST, but easily accessible from it. As I haven't figured out the detail of the design, I'm not sure whether PartWildMulti is something best expressed by this method or directly in the AST\n",
