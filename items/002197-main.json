  "body": "-L currently specifies paths to search for Rust crates\n\nBuilding crates that use native libraries is difficult. When the\nlibrary is located somewhere unexpected there is no way\nto tell rustc additional paths to look in.\n\nIf libclang is located at `.` then rustc is not going to\nknow that and linking will fail.\n\nTo get around that I often end up inserting\n\n```\n#[link_args = \"-L.\"] native mod m { }\n```\n\ninto other crates to get them to build.\n\nNow you just `rustc -L .` and it builds.\n\nThis doesn't do any rpathing so it's still up to somebody else\nto put the library somewhere it will be found or use LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\nThis feature comes with a single, XFAILed test, because I could\nnot think of a way to test it. Odd.\n",
