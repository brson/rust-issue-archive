    "body": "@Manishearth Please go ahead if you're interested!\n\nThe reason I hadn't gotten around to writing an RFC is my serious doubts around if allowing box patterns for arbitrary pointers is really feasible and/or a good idea. Essentially, for it to work the `deref` method would be required to be referentially transparent, something which the compiler cannot guarantee in the general case. Rust used to have a notion of purity for functions that was not well-defined and subsequently removed which in this case would probably be useful to have.\n\nBut I'm looking forward to your proposal and maybe it's workable!\n",
