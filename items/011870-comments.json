Lastly, on many occasions, the exact type names are generated by a macro which makes it quite impossible to even write a non-glob re-export without manual copy-pasting.\n\nI would find losing the glob imports to be a much easier change to adapt to, as it merely requires prefixing everything that's not a trait (traits are a pain to have to import one-by-one if you have many fine-grained traits, but that's a general problem that glob imports merely paper over). Luckily, I don't auto-generate traits just yet.\n",
