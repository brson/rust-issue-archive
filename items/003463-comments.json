For example, imagine comparing `(~str, ~str)`---in this case, we would match against the types `(A, B)` where `A` and `B` must implement `Eq`  Here `A` (and `B`) are `~str`, so `~str` must implement `Eq`.  This is in generic code so borrowing doesn't apply, since the code in question doesn't know if the value being compared is a `~str` (which could be borrowed) or something else.  \n",
