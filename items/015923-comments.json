    "body": "Closing as working as intended, the `deriving(Clone)` code will automatically add `T: Clone` for all type parameters on a struct. In the first piece of code you require `T` to adhere to `FooTrait` to implement `Clone`, but in the second piece you only require `Clone` (from `deriving(Clone)`).\n\nYou'll likely want to either derive clone in both circumstances or manually implement `Clone` in both.\n",
