    "body": "We got a chance to talk about this today, and the general feeling here is that this stabilization feels a little rushed. I'm curious, but do you know if there's much usage of this feature today? I was personally unaware of many users of this feature or your `debug-builders` crate.\n\nOverall these APIs also seem like they haven't been subjected to the scrutiny one might expect from a stable API (from the community at large, not necessarily just us per se). In terms of stabilizing new APIs in the standard library we've toyed with the idea of a \"final comment period\"-like segment of time where users of Rust can browse soon-to-be-stable APIs, but this would take some infrastructure investment to see it realized.\n\nTo be clear I don't think the 1.1 window has passed for this feature once we release 1.0, I'm fine cherry picking a change such as this back into beta.\n",

    "body": "@bluss Actually realized that my original suggestion is both more verbose than it needs to be and not quite right. We don't want to directly forward the `Formatter` object into `LowerHex`'s `fmt` method since we wouldn't want to pass along extra formatter flags etc like `#` since it'll change behavior. A more robust way would be to use `format_args!` which lets you specify exactly which formatter trait and flags you want to use:\n\n``` rust\n....\n    .field(\"flag\", &format_args!(\"{:x}\", self.tag))\n....\n```\n",
