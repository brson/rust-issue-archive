Just an outsider looking in, but it seems to me that the straightforward way to resolve this would be to go ahead and make the things illegal, and see if anything important breaks. It's easier to re-allow something later if there turns out to be a use case than the other way around.\n\nThe one case I can think of offhand where you might want to have a private thing showing up in public API is to have a private super-trait of a public trait. This has the effect that other modules can use the trait, put it in their type signatures, and so forth, everything except make an `impl` for it. (Then again that might be better expressed by having a `#[no_external_impls]` attribute or something, but right now there's no such thing as far as I know.)\n",

Anything preventing you from doing this (such as the compiler linkage errors) are just that, compiler bugs.\n",
