Why not just pass the actual identifier `ALICEBLUE` into the macro?\n",

    "body": "It kind of sucks if you have to write `define_color!(ALICEBLUE, \"aliceblue\");` There are a few hundred of these, and we'd have to write every color name twice just to define them. We could make all the statics lowercase, but that isn't idiomatic.\n\nThen there is the other part of it which is macro-izing the giant match statement to parse color names. We were hoping to do `parse_color!(some_str, aliceblue, antiquewhite, ...);` instead of parse_color!(some_str, ALICEBLUE, \"aliceblue\", ANTIQUEWHITE, \"antiquewhite\", ...);`.\n\nIs there another way around this such that we don't have to repeat the same characters multiple times?\n",
