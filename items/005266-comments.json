It seems like boolean values are such a fundamental thing, conceptually part of if statements etc., that it IS in the language, even if not present by named tokens.\n\nIt makes sense to keep complex, optional things, like bitstrings in the core/standard libraries, but come on... when are you going to write a program that WON'T have boolean values/logic in it?  And if you have that, where is the sense in moving one line of that to a separate file?\n\nIf the point is to simply have fewer keywords, I don't think these are the keywords to drop.  bools are EVERYWHERE in programming.

    "body": "@lee-b: two reasons that I can think of. First off, there shouldn't be any impact to the end user. We'll still have `true` and `false`, they'll just be an enum variant, not a first-level object in a compiler.\n\nSecond: this will simplify the compiler and should help us to avoid bugs. With booleans as a first class object, it's easy for us to fix a bug for booleans and not for other types, or vice versa.\n\nFor everyone else: There's one more case to consider, which is that of the serializers. I like the idea of keeping `serialize_bool`, because it allows us to serialize to formats that support native boolean types. It's also a nice pattern that could solve the hack we have in the JSON serializer, where `emit_enum_variant` checks for variants named `Some` and `None` to handle JSON null values. It would be much more elegant if we just added an `emit_option` to handle that specific case, and let `serialize_enum_variant` handle the generic case.\n",
