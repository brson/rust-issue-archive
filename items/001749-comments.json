    "body": "I'm thinking of working on this for a class project but I'm unfamiliar with the internal of rustc. tjc has told me to focus on adding warning for now, and then work on eliminating dead code if I still have time, so I have been looking inside librustc/middle to figure out what to do. Since this issue is about adding a new pass and (I presume) the logic is similar to the liveness analysis in librustc/middle/liveness.rs, does that mean I'm supposed to create a new file in librustc/middle/ (say foo.rs) with a top-facing pub fn check_crate that does something similar to liveness.rs, and then call middle::foo::check_crate inside librustc/driver/driver.rs? Also, is there difficulty in checking for unused non-exported functions inside the existing liveness.rs rather than doing a separate pass?\n\n(sorry if the above are stupid questions)\n",
