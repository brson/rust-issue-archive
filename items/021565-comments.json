I thought we could add things like this as part of the \"stability not stagnation\".\n\nAlthough we have a distinction of `#[unstable]` APIs in the standard library it does not mean that it will become a \"dumping ground\" for everything submitted. The lifetime of a new API is:\n1. An RFC is created for a new API and is discussed.\n2. The RFC is accepted.\n3. The RFC is implemented with `#[unstable]` APIs\n4. Some time later, the APIs are removed or promoted to `#[stable]`\n\nAll currently `#[unstable]` APIs are either planned for removal or planned to be revisited at some point in the future to stabilize.\n\nAlong these lines, I do not think that this `map_lock_result` is an API that we would want to stabilize, so it should not be included at this time. The `PoisonError::new` API is a fine candidate for stabilization, however, as it follows a well accepted pattern of constructors and is a very minor (and probably expected) addition to the API.\n",
