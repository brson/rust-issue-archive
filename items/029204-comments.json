    "body": "> If this is added to Option, why not Result?\n\nYou can start asking that about all enum types. I think it matters more for `Option` though. I quite often carry `Option`s around in data structures and need to mutate them in place. I don't do that so much with `Result`. `Result` is mainly used as the result of a function.\n\n> This doesn't mirror the `insert` signature on all other collections.\n\nPerhaps a different name would suit better? It was a combination of the `insert` methods on the `VacantEntry`/`OccupiedEntry` types that I had in mind but a full-blown `entry` API on `Option` would be overkill. \n\n> Should the previous value be returned? Or just an interior pointer?\n\nI'm indifferent.\n",
