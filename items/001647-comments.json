I guess the key point is that C-like enums can be represented differently from enums with data with relative ease.  To what extent is the size of integer used for an enum defined in the C spec? Is it all impl. dependent?\n",

    "body": "This has more to do with us not being LP64 I imagine. Which is to say: our ints are bigger than those in C, on a lot of 64 bit platforms. But we don't have `long` (and I don't want it), so we wound up effectively going ILP64, which is rarer.\n\nNot really sure what to do about it. Comments welcome. Being LP64 -- that is, demoting our `int` down to the same size whatever our platform's C int is -- would make the C interop story a bit, certainly. So it might be wise. See http://www.viva64.com/media/images/content/a/size_t_and_ptrdiff_t/image2.png for a rough picture of the popularity of each.\n\nSomething about keeping 32-bit integers alive-by-accident longer than necessary just rubs me the wrong way, I guess. It's 2012. I imagine I can buy 64-bit-word phones by now.\n",

    "body": "I think it's true (or at least sufficiently true for our purposes) that, given a C enum and given an ABI, there exists an integer type to be used for it.  It might vary per enum, and it might not be the same on an AMD64-SysV-based platform and an APCS-based platform, but this is already true for data representations in general.  So, a \"represent this like C\" flag could work.\n\nThe other thing going on here is Rust's existing knowledge of C representations, which is currently in `core::libc` as typedefs rather than in the compiler.  This  makes things more interesting, because any enum annotation that would allow referencing them (\u201cthis enum should be represented as a C int\u201d) needs to either be real syntax so it can contain a type expression, or else (e.g., if it's done with attributes) call into name resolution in a way that I don't think anything else does, or maybe language items could work.  It also suggests that the knowledge of C enum layout should be in `core::libc`, and that probably needs at least 12 typedefs ({8, 16, 32, 64} \u00d7 {fits in unsigned, fits in signed, fits in either}), and I don't know what else would need it.\n\nThe other other thing is that I don't know how much of this is actually needed, at least in the short term.\n",

    "body": "I've found some more context on the ARM enum ABI issue:  http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2012-02/msg00315.html\n\nSo there are two variants of the ABI.  A quick test for `arm-linux-androideabi` and `arm--netbsdelf` shows that they appear to both use the long-enum variant of the ABI.\n\nThe i386 and MIPS variants of the SysV ABI are handled annoyingly, in the versions of the spec I found: enums are listed as 4 bytes always, and the `long long` type doesn't appear to exist.  GCC for i386, at least, will use an 8-byte type for enums that need it.\n",
