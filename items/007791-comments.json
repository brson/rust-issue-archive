Then one could set `RUST_FLAGS` to `--emit=asm`, and only get assembler code produced, and not have the binary code produced. One problem that I still have not figured out is how the names of the outputs could be specified.\n",

    "body": "I do like the idea of consolidating what is now like 8 flags into one, although there's one complication that I can think of. Currently the lib/bin distinction affects codegen in terms of visibility of functions, so with `--emit` you don't necessarily have a method of saying \"output the library IR and output the executable IR\".\n\nI suppose we could default to \"output the library IR\", but if you're debugging IR for reachability optimizations you may not want that. I think I'd be ok with this as the default.\n\nI do like the idea of one `--emit` though, and I think that the comma-separated list of `type[=dest]` is a good idea as well. I think that `-o` will definitely \"just fall into place\" after this is done.\n\nNominating, I'm mostly a fan of this proposal and if we're doing this for 1.0 we need to remove the existing flags sooner rather than later.\n",
