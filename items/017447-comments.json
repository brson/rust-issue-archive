    "body": "First, sorry for the delay in decision about this PR, which was partly due to uncertainty around the overall strategy for improving `equiv`.\n\nWe're now ready to move forward with this API. Although [collections reform](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/235) offers a somewhat more ergonomic and general way to improve `equiv` and friends (through the `Borrow` trait), there will undoubtedly still be situations where an API uses generics but does not opt in to `Borrow`. The APIs in this PR give you a slick way to work around that problem.\n\nThanks for discovering and contributing this clever hack!\n",

    "body": "@thestinger Ok, thinking more about it, leaving these as free functions is probably for the best, but I do think they make sense to go in the slice modules, since the main \"receiver\" types are slice types.\n\nAlso, what about `DerefString` and `DerefVec` for the type names? I agree that the name isn't important for stability purposes, but with core modules people tend to look a lot at the documentation and a name like `AsString` is likely to send the wrong message.\n\nr=me with the above.\n",
