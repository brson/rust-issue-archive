    "body": "@kballard Thanks for the feedback on this. I've switched to use an Option type, as you suggested, and changed the tests to reset the PATH variable when complete.\n\nTo address your other concerns:\n- I agree that it's troubling to add parsing for Windows paths without a clear spec, but I tried fairly hard to track one down and failed, so I think it's worth taking a best-effort approach here. See https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/909 for details on what libuv does, if you're curious.\n- I had considered breaking out the parsing as a separate API, but it doesn't seem worth adding to the surface area of OS for parsing $PATH-formatted data that's not actually coming from $PATH, which I suspect would be a relatively rare use-case.\n",
