    "body": "We call a \"landing pad\" a segment of code which is run whenever an unwinding happens. This means that after some function was called, something down in the call stack ended up calling `fail!()` triggering an unwinding of the stack. Each call instruction in a function may trigger unwinding, and is then associated with a landing pad. These landing pads are what run destructors when the stack unwinds.\n\nWith the `-Z no-landing-pads` switch, none of these landing pads are generated. They end up calling special functions in the `libunwind` library which may not be present on all platforms.\n\nOn ARM, it looks like the codegen is so different that if the code isn't built to have exceptions thrown that there's no way for libunwind to unwind the stack when an exception is thrown. I suppose it doesn't affect x86 and x86_64 codegen that much.\n\nI was basically trying to think of a way to test that `-Z no-landing-pads` actually works (it was broken recently), so that's what this test is doing. The behavior is ARM-specific (from what I believe), so I think it's ok to just ignore it on android.\n",
