    "body": "I would personally rather hold off on these kinds of conversions until we have our story a bit more thought out. Right now it's pretty piecemeal what iterators can be converted back to the original item, and it would be nice to have consistency across the board instead of adding one-off unstable iterators here and there.\n\nI feel that in the case of #27775 this kind of functionality is nice, but so rarely used that it's not worth it right now. Almost no iterators have actual methods on the iterators (they're all just straight implementors of `Iterator`), so this is an idiom we don't have much experience with moving forward. \n",
