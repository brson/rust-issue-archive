I can certainly more aggressively document various aspects and I certainly wouldn't mind rewriting various code paths. I don't think that we want to just look at this and jettison jemalloc, though, as there are very real other use cases for swapping out for custom allocators (such as Servo's memory tracking, embedded systems with different allocators, etc). \n\nIf we followed reasoning like this I would also say that supporting both dylibs/rlibs at the same time is pretty complex, but I don't feel the need to remove that distinction. There's concrete use cases for both so we just need to support both in as robust a manner as possible.\n\n---\n\n@retep998 \n\n> You know, this reminds me of the time we had green threaded IO, then split it using virtual dispatch between a green and a native portion, then later dropped the green part entirely.\n\nI don't think that this is the same situation as here most notably because there's no virtual dispatch here. This is a static decision which is made that has no costs associated with it (unlike the virtual dispatch).\n\nLike I said above, complexity is not a reason to jettison something, it's a reason to rethink why it's so complex and consider other options, but in this case I don't consider removing jemalloc an option.\n\nIf there are bugs on Windows caused by our usage of jemalloc (I was unaware of these), then we should track them down and fix them, but removing it from all platforms is a pretty heavy hammer.\n",

    "body": "A few comments...\n- The ability to provide custom allocators is very important and useful.\n- In the context of Rust, I've heard it said many times that jemalloc is faster, but I haven't seen any measurements showing this. (Hmm, now that I think of it, somebody may have mentioned that using jemalloc sped up rustc significantly? Not sure.)\n- Servo uses a mixture of jemalloc (for Rust code) and the system heap (for C/C++ code, e.g. SpiderMonkey). Servo's memory reporting code thus has machinery for dealing with both: it reports the total size of both heaps, and it uses `je_malloc_usable_size` to measure jemalloc heap blocks and `malloc_usable_size` (on Linux) or `malloc_size` (on Mac) to measure system heap blocks.\n",

    "body": "> there are very real other use cases for swapping out for custom allocators (such as Servo's memory tracking, embedded systems with different allocators, etc). \n\nstrong +1 to this.  Even if we dropped jemalloc I'd _still_ want the ability to swap in a different allocator at the lowest level.\n\n(I have more than once taking the tack, when debugging some hairy issue, of manually instrumenting our allocator. This strategy is very useful, but hard to deploy in our current infrastructure; this PR will make it nearly trivial, and could, in principle, enable the introduction of a marketplace of debuggable liballoc API's.)\n",

Binaries and Rust dylibs will use jemalloc by default where available and staticlibs/other dylibs will use the system allocator by default.\n\nI think it is fine to have a default allocator. However, I am working on microcontroller stuff using `#![feature(no_std)]` where I try to avoid all dynamic allocation. In that case, I would like to have the option of opting out of having any allocator whatsoever. This would be particularly useful for libraries that guarantee they do not use the heap.\n",
