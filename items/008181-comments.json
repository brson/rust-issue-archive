Almost everyone expects debug output by default, and this way you have to explicitly opt-in to the faster version. We could configure the bots to pass `--cfg ndebug` to speed them up, but almost all devs want `--cfg debug`.\n\nAlso the `--enable-optimize` flag to the `configure` script should pass `--cfg ndebug` I imagine as well.\n",

    "body": "I'm still trying to figure out what the scope of this bug actually is; as I asked @brson, is this request merely for a change to how the _snapshot_ `rustc` is built?  That seems like something we can (and should) do easily.\n\nBut, allowing for a bit of scope creep beyond that for a moment... : \n\n@alexcrichton When you say \"_Almost everyone_ expects debug output by default\", do you mean rustc-hackers expecting debug output from invocations of `rustc`, or do you mean Rust programmers expect debug output from the programs that they compile?\n\nFor Rust programmers, I support making the expected common case, whatever it may be, as painless as possible, which could imply switching to `--cfg ndebug`.  I'm not sure if I have the same paternal mindset towards rustc-hackers on their own.\n\nAlso, are you suggesting that people write `#[cfg(not(ndebug))]` to guard their debug-only code?  Or are you suggesting that `--cfg ndebug` somehow turn off `cfg(debug)` setting that is otherwise on by default?  (These are the two immediate options that I see for implementing `ndebug`, and neither one really appeals to me.)\n\nAs you probably have inferred, I personally don't mind the current `--enable-debug` and `--cfg debug` setup (but then again I'm used to having wrapper scripts around configure that infer the flags from my build directory names).\n",

I would expect that to print by default (without me having to do anything different than invoking `rustc`.\n\nThat being said, you're right about now \"debug code\" is hidden behind `#[cfg(not(ndebug))]` which not only looks silly but it's nearly impossible to understand. I also agree that this shouldn't affect whether the `--cfg debug` variable should _also_ get set.\n\nAlthough `#[cfg(debug)]` makes perfect sense to me, having `debug!` print by default makes more sense to me, so I think that we should favor `debug!`.\n\nThe problem that I've seen is that it's very easy to forget the `--enable-debug` if you're not using scripts (which perhaps I should...), but I'm also worried rust binaries in general.\n",

Its unfortunate that neither of those Pull Requests mentioned this ticket, so I didn't get a direct notification.\n\nFrom skimming PR #9278, it looks like you simply accepted the `#[cfg(not(ndebug))]` annotations, despite your agreement with me above that it looks silly?  Am I right about this?\n\nFinally, PR #9278 seems to contradict directly the intent of PR #7822.  _I_ do not mind having the `debug!` macro enabled by default.  But from what I read, @pcwalton had asked for `debug!` to be turned off by default; did he sign off on this?\n\n(Sorry if the above note sounds curt; maybe there had been consensus amongst the group in California and I simply missed it since it was not logged here.)\n",

    "body": "After some reflection, it does not seem like a terrible burden to require end-users to opt into  `ndebug` in order to get the faster debug!-free object code.\n\nI'm still not a fan of the `#[cfg(not(ndebug))]` annotation, but I do not have a better suggestion besides going back to having `debug!` depend on `--cfg debug`.  (I can go either way on that.)\n\n I do not know whether @pcwalton's interest in conditionalizing `debug!` was for servo execution speed or for rustc bootstrap times.  In hindsight, it was probably for servo; but I guess they can turn on `ndebug`.\n\nSo, I'll stop making noise about this.\n",

    "body": "Gah, sorry about that! I totally forgot to cc this bug. There wasn't really an \"official\" consensus per se, more of a general feeling of agreement, and I'd be ok with reverting these in the meantime if there are strong feelings to be had.\n\nThat being said, I don't think that this really contradicts #7822. It's more of another way to go about solving it. In #7822, the compiler would be \"fast by default\", and now it's just \"verbose by default, which may not be fast\". For performance, we still have the option to omit the `debug!` statements (which was the goal all along).\n\nI also still agree that `cfg(not(ndebug))` is confusing, but as you've mentioned I'm having a difficult way of getting around that. The key idea that I want to have is that debug output is enabled by default, but there's a way to turn it off if you want. This is along the same lines of a debug assert macro. There is precedent with C's `NDEBUG` define for `assert`, but that doesn't mean that it's a good precedent to follow.\n\nAs for #9385, that's simply a mistake on my part of overlooking that debug output wasn't enabled by default for the compiler. I was curious why we didn't see a spike in compile-times when the previous pull request landed, but when #9385 lands we should see a spike. To go back to normal we'd just need to pass `--disable-debug` to the configure scripts on the bots.\n\nAgain though, sorry about forgetting to cc this here, I should have at least but \"cc #8181\" on one of the pulls :(.\n",
