    "body": "In hindsight, it seems natural that this would result in a regression - by removing the `Rc` around `NameBindings`, I slimmed down the `children` field of `Module` at the expense of bloating `ImportResolution`. However, everything should be imported more often than it is defined, and so this results in a net increase in memory usage.\n\nUnfortunately, removing this instance of `Rc` was crucial to removing the `RefCell` around `NameBindings`, allowing direct, mutable access to the structure while it was being constructed. There is no way that I know of to create a `Rc` but temporarily \"disable\" it while a mutable reference to its insides is in scope.\n\nWhile I think that this sort of thing is a good idea, it seems that this specific change would require much larger changes than what I currently have done, and while I plan to do more drastic changes, they don't fall under the scope of this PR, so I am closing it.\n",
