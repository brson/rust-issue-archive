The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @steveklabnik (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

(I.e. remove \"Marx\", \"Butler\", etc .\n\nIt would still suffer from a western bias, but at some point we have to draw a line somewhere.\n\nI'm mostly curious if you would have found a series of first names as unwelcoming \n",

If it's been controversial in the past, and it continues to stand out to some people, and nothing on the page says \"hey don't ask us to change this because we've been over it many times\" (which would be even more distracting), which means we can probably expect that people will continue to point it out, might it be worth changing strictly on attention conservation grounds?\n",
