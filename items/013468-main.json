  "body": "Previously, all slices derived from a vector whose values were of size 0 had a\nnull pointer as the 'data' pointer on the slice. This caused first pointer to be\nyielded during iteration to always be the null pointer. Due to the null pointer\noptimization, this meant that the first return value was None, instead of\nSome(&T).\n\nThis commit changes slice construction from a Vec instance to use a base pointer\nof 1 if the values have zero size. This means that the iterator will never\nreturn null, and the iteration will proceed appropriately.\n\nCloses #13467\n",
