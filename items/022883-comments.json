    "body": "Currently we are trying to hide the `intrinsics` module entirely from the standard library's API so in the long run these will not be accessible. (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22358#issuecomment-74462306 for some more info).\n\nIn the past we've been ok adding these form of intrinsics if they're directly used in the standard library and provide tangible benefits. Exposing them as a public API, however, would require an RFC in any case. For now though because these are not used internally and also not exposed through a stable interface, I'm going to close this. I also think that #20579 should live in the RFC repo instead of this repo as it's a general feature request, I'll see if can't get it moved over.\n\nThanks for the PR though!\n",
