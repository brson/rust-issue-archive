    "body": "It looks to me like an accidental change from the `fail!`->`panic!` rename.\n\n```\nThis task will randomly panic or succeed. `task::try` returns a `Result`\ntype, so we can handle the response like any other computation that may\npanic.\n```\n\nI can't parse any reasonable meaning from it this way, given that there is no way to recover a task from panicking.\n\nWhereas the point of `task::try` is to abstract over the fact that there's a potentially panicky task producing a result, allowing you to use your normal (return value based) error handling machinery to deal with it, just like almost all other non-panic types of failures. So with 'panic' changed back to 'fail' it communicates something meaningful.\n\nI'm trying to find meaning in the sentence as it stands, and I'm failing miserably. (But at least I'm not panicking! :smile:)\n",
