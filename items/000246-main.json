  "body": "Graydon,\n\nI've translated the #fmt syntax extension to rustc. It currently builds but doesn't pass tests. The AST it builds depends on vector addition and calls into std, neither of which work yet. Once those are completed I'm interested in fleshing this out and adding tests.\n\nI'd particularly like you to review how I've interpreted the expr_ext AST node, to which I added a new expression parameter. I'm using it as expr_ext(path, argument_exprs, body_expr, expanded_expr, ann). The arguments and body parameters are used by the extension to generate the expanded expression, and only the expanded expression is folded and translated. The 'body' expression isn't used by #fmt.\n",
