I guess it's hard to know without measuring. Anybody on @rust-lang/compiler have an opinion? @dotdash?\n",

    "body": "I can't see how this would improve convergence time. Unreachable blocks are unreachable, whether or not they're removed from the MIR, so they aren't going to be visited during the depth-first search either way. The only reason I can see for removing the blocks each iteration before was because it was iterating over all blocks, reachable or otherwise, so removing them meant they weren't looked at unnecessarily.\n\nSince this code also changes the sub-passes to do a preorder traversal, there is no advantage to removing unreachable blocks before we hit a fixpoint any more. Therefore, I think we should keep the `remove_dead_blocks` function and run it just before returning.\n",

    "body": "Yeah, I'm not really sure. I remain mildly uncomfortable with this change, but I've kind of forgotten exactly why. I guess I still am just not sure that this is an improvement. Given that we did not land https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30238, as @Aatch suggested an [alternative approach](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30238#issuecomment-166503951), I think we ought to close this one too (since the two [seem to be linked](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30239#issuecomment-166486031)). Closing therefore. @gereeter let me know if I'm mis-remembering things, and thanks for the PR in any case.\n",
