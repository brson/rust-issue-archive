Taking a string and a number for a port\nI'm not sure is getting us much closer to the goal.\n```\n\nIMO (and as you later observe) the most annoying part is setting up the SocketAddr jazz. I find the string-only API a little surprising. With the exception of Go, most mainstream languages I've seen tend to separate host+port for this sort of convenience method:\n\n[Ruby](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/socket/rdoc/TCPSocket.html#method-c-new), [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html#socket.create_connection) (the host+port is a tuple here), [Java](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html#Socket%28java.lang.String, int%29), [C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/115ytk56)\n\nNot that we need to blindly follow that convention, I guess I just don't see the gap between the convention-friendly `TcpStream::open(\"google.com\", 80)` and what you're proposing. :)\n\nHappy to move things to liburl if that seems more appropriate -- I don't feel _that_ strongly about it -- but given we're talking about potentially moving it out of libstd to satisfy the proposed interface I thought I might offer up this alternative.\n\nAnyway, let me know if you're still set on the single string arg for open/bind & a move to liburl -- easy enough either way. I assume you don't want to move the entirety of TcpStream into liburl -- imagine something like `url::open(\"google.com:80\")`?\n\n```\nAdditionally, the semantics around DNS resolution are a little tricky here, especially in the\ntimeout case. The timeout being supplied is not an overall timeout, but rather only for one\nconnect operation, not the DNS lookup, nor the whole batch of connects (if there are many).\nIt's close to the best that we can do, but I think that filling this out more will require a good\ndeal more code (just guessing, though).\n```\n\nI totally agree with all this. We could subtract the DNS lookup time from the remaining connect timeout, but then if the first connect fails & we fall back to a second A record we're left with ambiguity wrt what the \"correct\" behavior should be.\n\nOptions for dealing with this in other languages vary -- [Ruby](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/socket/rdoc/TCPSocket.html#method-c-new) offers no timeout support out of the box & seems to rely on things like `select` to handle timeouts, [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0a419b7b030dae59ce16bc3620c4f92a5530beb4/Lib/socket.py) ignores the DNS aspect entirely & assumes the given timeout is for the `connect` call.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I'd be just as happy to ditch the open_timeout implementation for now & maybe look at our options there another time.\n",

I think it would be cool to have something like `url::open` one day, but I'm not entirely sure how that would work...\n\nCould you add some tests for opening a stream with hosts that look like `\"127.0.0.1\"` or `\"[::1]\"`, etc? I'm curious what happens when you pass IPs in. Additionally, let's mark the function as `experimental` for now, I'm not entirely sure if it's in the right location for forever.\n\nI also agree with removing `open_timeout` for now. If it's necessary, you can manually resolve the host and then use `connect_timeout` for now.\n",

Otherwise you wind up with rubbish like this:\n\n```\nlet mut listener = TcpListener::listen(\"0.0.0.0\", 8080);\nlet mut acceptor = listener.listen(); // listen *again*?\n// ...\n```\n\nInstead, maybe something like this?\n\n```\nlet mut acceptor = TcpAcceptor::listen(\"0.0.0.0\", 8080); // or TcpAcceptor::bind(...)?\n// ...\n```\n\nThough then you can't get at TcpListener::socket_name(), which is a problem if you pass in zero for the port number ... hrm.\n",

    "body": "Hm that is a good point, `::listen` followed by `.listen` is a little silly. I don't think that we should short circuit the listener => acceptor transition just yet, but we could also provide `socket_name` on acceptors if we really need to.\n\nOne route we could go is to add `foo` and `foo_addr` methods, but it's a bit unfortunate to have that sort of duplication, and I would like to try to avoid it. \n\nThinking out loud here for a second, perhaps we could only provide support for `foo(&str, u16)`. The semantics of `connect` could be that it first attempts to parse as a `SocketAddr`, falling back to `getaddrinfo`. The semantics of `bind` would be it attempts to parse a `SocketAddr`, returning an error if that fails. We'd have to commit to these apis, but it may be worth thinking about them carefully rather than duplicating the functionality?\n",

    "body": "Oh to have overloading eh? :) It'd be `bind(SocketAddr)` + `bind(&str, u16)` and this conversation would be a whole lot shorter.\n\nI can kind of imagine the struct `SocketAddr` version of `foo` coming back one day (e.g. folks making their own DNS calls because maybe they want to control DNS lookup timeouts (!)). Without it, they'd have to pay the overhead of converting from SocketAddr to str and back again inside `foo(&str, u16)`.\n\nAll that said, I feel like `foo(&str, u16)` is a nicer API for most use cases if I had to pick one right now.\n\nAnother random idea: `TcpListener::from_socket_addr`/`TcpListener::from_host_port`? Same deal for `TcpStream`. A little wordy, but maybe clearer. Naming this stuff is hard because I'm not sure we have conventions for this sort of thing that feel Rust-y yet.\n",

The addr version was removed entirely, and now you have to keep slinging strings around, which has much more cognitive overload with lifetimes than a simple copyable SocketAddr. How often do you really connect to a hardcoded remote endpoint that optimizing the string-directly-in-the-call case is important?\n\n(To be clear, I'm mostly advocating that the version that takes SockAddr be brought back, probably as `open_addr` as mentioned in the discussion.)\n",

    "body": "When a function is taking `&str` then there's not a whole lot of lifetimes involved because nothing is being chained through, _any_ lifetime will satisfy the requirements.\n\nIt's not that connecting to a hardcoded endpoint is uncommon, I found it much easier to deal with the string representations of ips rather than the `SocketAddr` type itself. I believe this case to be important because it does not require duplication, which isn't all that necessary. The `open_addr` implementation would probably look a lot like `open(addr.ip.to_str(), addr.port)`, which seems less clean due to the duplication in the API to me.\n",

    "body": "I also feel strong about keeping `SocketAddr` methods. I gave strings a try for a few days (because I'm used to use SocketAddr), but I still don't like it much. `SocketAddr`/`IpAddr` is a perfect data structure for holding an ip address. It represents a distinct address, is comparable, can be shown without extra allocations (fmt::Show) and can be easily parsed from a string (FromStr). I think a system-level language like Rust should provide a socket interface that uses this native data types.\n\nI understand that strings are convenient to use (especially with user interactions) and I like the idea of a method that parses a string, does dns lookups and connects to one address - but imo this method shouldn't hide the real connect method using a native type.\n\nE.g. in a lib I'm currently working on, there's some p2p stuff that keeps list of peers, exchanges them, connects them and so on. After this PR, I changed 9 `connect` calls. 7 of them ended up with `connect(addr.ip.to_str(), addr.port)` (which is awful, since it allocates a new string just to write the SocketAddr to it and `connect` runs a parser that gets a SocketAddr back out of it). \n\nI would very welcome if Rust would keep methods using `SocketAddr` for system-level-like access and provide convenience methods with string parameters without taking away the possibility to use `SocketAddr`. How about this:\n\n```\n// TcpStream convenience methods (internally calls connect)\nfn open(host: &str, port: u16) -> IoResult<TcpStream>\nfn open_timeout(host: &str, port: u16, timeout_ms: u64) -> IoResult<TcpStream>\n\n// TcpStream raw methods\nfn connect(addr: &SocketAddr) -> IoResult<TcpStream>\nfn connect_timeout(addr: &SocketAddr, timeout_ms: u64) -> IoResult<TcpStream>\n\n// TcpListener convenience methods (internally calls bind and listen and loops accept)\nfn open(host: &str, port: u16, f: |TcpStream|) -> IoResult<()>\n\n// TcpListener raw methods\nfn bind(addr: &SocketAddr) -> IoResult<TcpListener>\n```\n",

Duplication in the API is unfortunate because you'll constantly forget whether to call open/connect or bind/open with what you have, and it also just leads to a general explosion of related methods. I generally find that reducing the API is one of the most important concerns.\n\nThe other downside you pointed out, allocating strings, I don't consider that large of a problem. When compared with opening a TCP socket or binding a TCP socket, I don't think that the allocation will show up that high in the profiles.\n",

I started working on a universal open method a while back though it didn't get very far due to lack of time, but you can see it at https://gist.github.com/Seldaek/73aefd28ca5ff5655bac - I think having explicit internal libs + a \"magic\" open() function wrapping them for ease of use with strings is at least a better solution than just supporting string inputs.\n",
