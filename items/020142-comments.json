    "body": "For [crypto-bench](https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench), we want to run `cargo bench` on the CI infrastructure to ensure all the tests build. However, we don't want to actually benchmark on the CI infrastructure, because the CI infrastructure isn't reliable enough for benchmarking. Thus, doing more than one iteration on the CI infrastructure just wastes time.\n\nAnd, that time, in particular the wall time, negatively affects my other repos, because generally CI services like Travis CI and Appveyor only allow one project to build at a time, for their free open source tiers.\n\nFurther, even out side of CI infrastructure, we want contributors to run the benchmarks before sending PRs. But, it's not reasonable to expect them to wait through many minutes of perf tests before asking for a PR.\n\nHere are two ideas:\n1. Add a `--max-seconds n`  that overrides the default targeted benchmark execution time so that we can write `--max-seconds 0` to run tests once. \n2. Add a `--max-iterations n` so we can write `--max-iterations 1`.\n\nI prefer #1 because that also might help with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/11010.\n",
