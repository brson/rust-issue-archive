However the warning is emitted using warn!(...) which means it doesn't actually display to the user unless they have turned on warn logging for rustdoc, which seems unlikely.\n\nWould this approach (concatenating all doc-comments) be ok?\n",

See the pull request - it makes multi-line `///` comments work the same as `/** ... */` comments (as a side effect of concatenating all kinds of doc-comment).\n\nUnfortunately multi-line comments seem a bit broken in general with rustdoc. In html output mode they are concatenated into a single line (I think due to some weirdness with pandoc).\n",
