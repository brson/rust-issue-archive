    "body": "This looks like if you attempt to target `arm-apple-darwin` on a non-osx system, you'll get past ./configure and probably die horribly in `make`. Is that ok to happen? I'm not sure how comprehensive our support for android is (does it also die horribly on misconfigurations?). I think I'm ok with this, but targeting those platforms is hair enough as-is so it may be difficult.\n\nPerhaps it would be nice to put a check in `./configure` to print an error if you attempt to configure a target of `arm-apple-darwin` and the host is _not_ something-apple-darwin?\n",
