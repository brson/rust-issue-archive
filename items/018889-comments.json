    "body": "Yes this is simply how you explicitly specify the type for a generic function call. I believe it's like that to resolve a parsing ambiguity.  What shows in rustdoc is how the function is declared, not how it's used. I agree that this is confusing, though. But as @glfharris notes, this is at very least demonstrated in the guide.\n\n@steveklabnik, any thoughts on if we should do more to address this?\n",
