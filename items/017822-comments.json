I find much of my time when teaching new people (I've been doing a lot of it lately) is taken up explaining how to interpret compiler errors about lifetimes, which is a strong indicator of the quality of the error messages.\n\nThe tricky thing with generating better error messages is that it can be generally hard for the compiler to tell what the programmer intended to do. Perhaps generating elided lifetimes in error messages would be interesting, i.e. in an error message the above example would appear as something like:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo<'a> {...}\nimpl<'a> Foo<'a> {\n    fn bar<'b>(&'b self) -> Bar<'b> {...}\n}\n```\n\nAn `unused lifetimes` lint would also help in cases like these.\n",

    "body": "I should mention that the terrible error messages for lifetimes come from regionck, which has to infer them (and unlike types, you can't annotate most of the lifetimes in a function.\n\nWhat regionck does, AFAIK, is it collects constraints from expressions like function calls, propagates the constraints, and produces errors if there are conflicts.\nBut regionck cannot tell \"bad\" constraints from \"good\" constraints, and \"bad\" ones can easily propagate further than \"good\" ones.\n\nThat just made me think that blame assignment heuristics are likely a waste of time.\nHowever, listing all the constraint sources, like function calls, _and_ **annotating** lifetimes in those expressions, that would be highly helpful.\n\n@wycats I believe we \"just\" need to list the expressions generating those type variables, in a similar way to my suggestion for lifetimes above.\n",

    "body": "What is the nomination here? Disallowing lifetime elision inside an impl generic over lifetimes?\n\nI would like to suggest refraining from complaining about how long things take to implement. The reason why P-backcompat-lang issues take priority is obvious. The reason why P-backcompat-lang issues are not done is that people keep filing, nominating, and accepting new ones, expanding the scope of the language for 1.0. For example, we have 10 (10!!) nominations right now, just for this week.\n",
