    "body": "The idea with just storing the function pointer for single-method interfaces won't work. The 'dict' stored in the value does not just contain the vtable. If you have for example this impl:\n\n```\nimpl <T: to_str> of to_str for [T] { ... }\n```\n\nIt must also store the tydesc for T and the dict for the to_str implementation of T that was in scope at the point that created the boxed iface. So you'll always, even for ifaces that themselves do not have parameters, have to allow for these extra fields.\n\nAs for the &/~/@ stuff... I'm always grossed out by more sigils being added to say simple things, but I guess this does add expressiveness, and people are already familiar with a similar system for fns, so I could live with it.\n",

    "body": "So, the bit about optimizing single-entry vtables is not important, I just threw it in for fun.  I'm not surprised it's more complex than I first envisioned.  I am more interested in the bounds so that we can make instances sendable and more analogous to closures.  \n\nSimilarly, I don't have a strong opinion about whether instances should be one or two words, but I think two words would allow us to avoid an allocation in some cases (basically impls over pointer types).  I am sure there is a wrinkle there I haven't thought all the way through as well. =)\n",
