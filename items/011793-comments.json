    "body": "I also fear that this may not be the best solution for this problem. My biggest concern is that you can't retroactively go back and remove visit glue from libraries you're linking to (you'd have to recompile them). For example the no-landing-pads option will retroactively modify code when performing LTO, which isn't great because it only runs on LTO, but it's at least possible.\n\nI feel like the general usage pattern of `{:?}` is that for executables it's fine, but for libraries it should be easy to use during development but hard to deploy in a release build of the library.\n\nRegardless, I'd be curious to get some more opinions on this.\n",
