The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @brson (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "One further fault this addition may have: it should be possible, by adding the library you create in rust to the system library locations, or by otherwise finding a [cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) comment syntax to link against it, to invoke rust from go without needing a third party ffi library wrapper. That I was unable to figure out a way to link against a library in cgo using a relative path does not, after all, mean it is impossible.\n\nI don't know if that is important.\n",

    "body": "Hey @PeterSP ,\n\nSo, I am conflicted here. On one hand, I really like this addition. On the other hand... well let me just spill it out:\n1. this isn't intended to be a full reference to this, just an intro, so keeping it to a few languages makes sense.\n2. If we don't want to include every language. maybe this just shouldn't be here at all?\n3. On the other hand, it's a really popular section.\n4. How are we going to keep up with those other languages? What about when they change? I can't monitor too many other languages for breaking changes, and this section basically can't get tested...\n\nSo, I'm not sure what to do. I think I'm leaning towards \"this chapter should just be removed\", I think.\n",
