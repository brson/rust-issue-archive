Until then, all the types are recorded in the function context, which isn't available to `expr_kind`.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the strange example I posted above is just a weird part of the language. It accepts it because there's no reason not to. It doesn't actually do anything (well, it assigns to a temporary, not exactly broken code...).\n\nI've done some refactoring instead of this change though, now that I've looked at the issue properly. I'll open a new PR for it when I'm done.\n",
