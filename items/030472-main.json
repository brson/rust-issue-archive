It was written this way only to make explicit the necessity of one blanket impl for satisfying the other.\n\nI'm guessing that extensional equality is not judged, even though it is possible to make such a judgment and such a judgment must be made to compile code that compiles today. `<Self as A<'self_>>::T` on line 12 ought to be equated to `usize` (which must be detected at some other point in time else line 13 wouldn't be able to compile).\n\nEDIT: Playing around a bit, it looks more and more like it's all about the HKL bounds...\n",
