    "body": "Also, there are some other nice uses of liveness:\n- `trans` could simply check the liveness of variables to figure out when local variable cleanups need to be run. This means we could possibly get rid of `revoke_clean`.\n- We could communicate the liveness to LLVM via `llvm.lifetime.start` and `llvm.lifetime.end` intrinsics. Eventually this gives us a path to getting rid of zeroing allocas out.\n",
