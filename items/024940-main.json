The latter is closed, and so the usual search for I-nominated tagged issues will miss it, since we usually only look at _open_ issues tagged as such.\n\n(I suspect that it might actually suffice to just _open_ an issue each time this event occurs, since I suspect it should be a relatively rare occurrence.)\n",
