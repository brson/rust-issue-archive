I opened up another PR and closed the one from earlier today because the first PR was coming from the wrong branch of my repo.\nAnyway, this contains a fleshed-out implementation of TotalEq/TotalOrd/Clone/ToStr for the whole B-tree structure and relevant tests, integrating suggestions and comments from several community members.\nr? @catamorphism\n",
