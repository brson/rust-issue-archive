    "body": "We've got a huge number (~150) of unstable features in the standard library, and we need to start taking action on them. Many of them have been around for months so they either need to be deprecated or they need to be stabilized. This is a small set of features which feel pretty uncontroversial and are part of the crucial designs of primitives leading up to 1.0:\n- process::Child::id - otherwise there is no way to get the pid of a process\n- error::Error::{is, downcast*} - this is a vital part of the design of the `Error` trait being able to carry arbitrary payloads. This must be stabilized in one form eventually, and the current form seems quite adequate.\n- io::Error::{get_ref, get_mut, into_inner} - another crucial part of the design of `io::Error`, this will need to be stabilized eventually and we just didn't do so as they were added recently before 1.0 was released\n- hash::Hash::hash_slice - this is necessary for high-performance hashing of `&[u8]` and there's no particular reason we should prevent that optimization being implemented for user-defined types\n- hash::Hasher::write_\\* - this is necessary for high-performance hashing (not always working through an array of bytes), and there's no reason to limit that to in-tree implementations.\n\nI would like to include more but they all seemed to have at least one unresolved question.\n",
