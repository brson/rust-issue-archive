As well, the tests for read mode tokens not escaping are not needed anymore because I moved to a RAII model where the locks are reified as objects like `WriteLock`, and `ReadLock` instead.\n\nI did xfail https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7701/files#diff-15 , and https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7701/files#diff-16 though which when modified gave me strange internal compiler errors. I plan on submitting a full bug report on the issue but have not isolated a suitable small test case yet.\n\nAlso, I temporarily disabled the https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7701/files#diff-38 test case that failed on my machine, and forgot to change that back.

I'm not exactly happy with how the current system for condition variables works so I might make a few more changes.
