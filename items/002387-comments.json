    "body": "A few comments:\n- I like the move of changing from expression-arguments to balanced-token-list arguments. That is a good call. Also neatly solves the quoting problem for different grammar classes. 100% in favour of that.\n- I dislike removing `#` from invocation position. I think that makes invocations too non-obvious.\n- Item, type and pattern-position macros are a requirement in any new work. Can't just be exprs.\n- I _suspect_ it's advantageous to make the `Balanced*` productions be `Balanced [',' Balanced]*`, i.e. to make the grammar pre-cluster sequences of un-parenthesized balanced clusters using commas, the way the C preprocessor does. This requires users to parenthesize only when they expect to have an un-parenthesized comma in a cluster, and makes it more likely that users can pass un-parenthesized expressions as single macro args (eg. the \"second argument\" to `#fmt(\"%d\", 1 + 2)`, and just not notice that they're treated as balanced-lexeme-lists rather than exprs until expansion is complete.\n- I still think `#foo(...)` is a reasonable looks-function-call-like outermost syntax for the most common balanced-token-list form, with `#foo{...}` for the rarer character-level form. I don't feel inclined to tinker with those. They work already.\n- I assume part of the motive on that change was to satisfy the example at the top, where a macro-invocation looks like a block. I think this is unlikely to work; or if it's going to work you should be explicit about that goal, eg. say that `#foo{...}` is a block-like invocation, requiring no trailing semi, and `#foo(...)` is a call-like invocation, requiring a trailing semi (and then bump the custom-lexing case over to `#foo[...]` or `#foo\"...\"` or something). That's a plausible path to go down. Just keep in mind that the parser has to decide somewhat early where we have a block and where we need a semi.\n- If you do the above, possibly the pre-clustering with commas only makes sense for `#macro(...)`, i.e. those in call-like invocation position. Block-like macros would make more sense to pre-cluster using ... the semi rules :)\n- The main UI experience we have so far is that `#macro` is hard to remember how to use, so people skip using it. It's modeled on `syntax-case`, and I think that while that is appealing to schemers, it is more power than users need in a single macro-definition, most of the time. I think it might be reasonable to assume _one_ macro-defining call defines _one_ `pattern => result` pair, and require the user to write multiple macro-defining calls (or maybe a `#macro_extend` call) in order to add more cases to a macro. That is, I'd like to see if you can aim for a UI space _less_ complex than `syntax-case`, and only slightly more powerful than the C preprocessor's `#define` (eg. with variadic macros, possibly some tools to help with hygiene).\n",

    "body": "- I'm neutral on the issue of `#`. It'd make the parsing situation simpler, but it's nice for macros to look \"first-class\"\n- Other invocation positions are simple, except that there needs to be unambiguous syntax for them. \n- I'd rather not specify anything about the argument grammar by default. If the user wants comma-separated arguments, they can specify it. The parser can consume multiple `Balanced`s, so extra parentheses wouldn't be needed unless the grammar was ambiguous (at least locally).\n\nI'm going to put off thinking about notational issues about delimiters for the moment.\n- Perhaps we could have `syntax_pat` and `syntax_pats` to make the typical, single-definition case easier?\n",

    "body": "- The issue of `#` is not about making parsing _simpler_, it's making macros _not look first class_. Intentionally. Because all bets are off when it comes to interpreting their contents. `#fmt` doesn't even construct a string literal at runtime. `#log` is going to lazily-evaluate its arguments. `#rx` is going to compile a regular expression matcher. These are quite non-obvious and not something that will jump out at the reader if they just glance over the expressions making up the arguments. The `#` is a clue to the reader not to expect normal evaluation rules inside. Making things look like normal-evaluation-rules is, in my mind, an anti-feature. I realize the team has differing opinions about this, but my preference has been pretty consistent from the start.\n- Concerning commas, I suppose it's sufficient for the macro-defining extension to interpret the commas, or for there to be a cluster-by-commas utility in the extension-writing toolkit; I just want it to be likely that in normal modes of use, users don't have to parenthesize expression arguments to function-like macros, and people implementing extensions don't have to bend over backwards to get back to \"list of expressions\", when expressions were in fact what got passed.\n- Concerning `#syntax_pat` and `#syntax_pats` .. I'm curious if `#macro` (and perhaps `#macros` or `#multi_macro` or something) feels inappropriate. I assume this work is going to replace the current `#macro` extension anyway. Why rename it?\n",
