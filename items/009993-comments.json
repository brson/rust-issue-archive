    "body": "A little update on this: The actual memory leak has been fixed in LLVM (with this change: https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commit/d56c9db9603c3e2edf43405142dee60559559919) and the assertion should thus not be triggered any more, once we use a new version of LLVM.\n\nIt's still a problem/code smell that the same function is translated more than once. It's easy enough to fix this on the debug info side (just keep track of which functions have been handled already and skip otherwise) but I guess it would be better to fix the underlying issue (https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/7349).\n",
