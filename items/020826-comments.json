The root of that issue ultimately was that API docs are made up of doc comment blocks on individual items. Since each doc comment block compromises a whole \"subdocument\" of sorts, there's no way for the headings in a doc comment block to \"know\" which level they ought to be, because they don't know where or how they'll be inserted in a larger document (the whole API docs on a module or item or whatever).\n\nHere, we just have long prose documents that simply need to be marked \"down\" correctly but aren't right now.\n",
