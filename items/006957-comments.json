    "body": "Quite a bit of time has passed since this was opened, and I think that our need for such a testing infrastructure has lessened quite a bit over time. All of green scheduling has been removed along with many of the based-on-channels implementations of primitives like mutexes and condition variables.\n\nI think it'd still be great to have a suite of concurrency-testing primitives, but for now I think this isn't particularly actionable as-is (and has probably just been getting stale for some time now). As a result I'm going to close this, but we can certainly try to pursue strategies such as this in the future!\n",
