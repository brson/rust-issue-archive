  "body": "This fixes an issue where `extern \"C\"` functions would have internal linkage, making them invisible to anything that might be linked against the resulting object. In my use case, a Rust function is being called from assembly, and because the Rust symbol did not have the right linkage, I ran into linker errors.\n\nThis has also now been applied to bare Rust functions as well as statics that are publicly visible; that is, those which have a fully public path.\n",
