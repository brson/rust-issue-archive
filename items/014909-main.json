  "body": "Whenever something is added to the debuginfo::TypeMap there's a consistency check, making sure that the code does what it is supposed to do. For some types (e.g. slices in a recursion cycle) this check rightfully fails. However, there's no need to actually abort compilation as the inconsistency won't lead to corrupt state, due to LLVM metadata uniquing.\n\nA later, more thorough fix (coming next week) should remove the inconsistency altogether and also make this check non-fatal. For the time being, omit the check so people can compile their code with -g.\n",
