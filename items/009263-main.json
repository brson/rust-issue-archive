  "body": "r? @brson Treating a package as the thing that can have other packages depend on it,\nand depends on other packages, was wrong if a package has more than one\ncrate. Now, rustpkg knows about dependencies between crates in the same\npackage. This solves the problem reported in #7879 where rustpkg wrongly\ndiscovered a circular dependency between thhe package and itself, and\nrecursed infinitely.\n\nCloses #7879\n",
