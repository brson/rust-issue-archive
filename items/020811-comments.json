    "body": "@nikomatsakis: I think some kind of parser special case will always be necessary if we want to allow `v[0..a+b]`, avoid grammar inconsistencies between `..a` and `a..`, and not have a combinatorial explosion in the complexity of the formal grammar at the same time.\n\nI know this problem from when I tried writing a C# parser using a parser generator. It turns out that the Microsoft C# compiler is a hand-written recursive-descent parser using the shunting yard algorithm to parse binops. But not all C# binops are true binary operators taking two expressions: the `as` operator takes a type on the RHS, yet has lower precedence than some other binary operators. This results in some strange effects -- `a + b as c + d` is valid in C# and parses as `((a + b) as c) + d`, even though the precedence of `as` is lower than that of `+`. As far as I know, there is no way to write a formal grammar that accepts the same expressions as the MS C# compiler without duplicating all expression-related productions.\n\nI'd prefer if rust does not make the same mistake as C#, so any prefix- and suffix- operators must be forbidden from being used in a context which conflicts with their operator precedence, even if operator precedence is unnecessary to disambiguate the expression. As far as I know, `..` is currently the only prefix-/suffix- operator where this problem occurs, since `as` and all unary operators have a higher precedence than any binary operator.\n\nHere's how I imagine the formal grammar:\n\n```\nBitOrExpr = BitXorExpr | BitOrExpr \"^\" BitXorExpr\nRangeExpr = BitOrExpr | \"..\" BitOrExpr | BitOrExpr \"..\" | BitOrExpr \"..\" BitOrExpr\nCompExpr = RangeExpr | RangeExpr (\"==\" | \"!=\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"<=\" | \">=\") RangeExpr\nAndExpr = CompExpr | AndExpr \"&&\" CompExpr\n```\n\nThis means that \"^\" and \"&&\" are left-associative; comparison operators don't have any associativity (since RFC 558); and the range expression doesn't have any associativity either.\n\nI hope that this can be implemented without using a `restrictions` bitflag in the parser. But if not, I'd prefer special cases in the parser over special cases in the grammar.\n",

Only one is remotely sensible (`b..(&&c)`) so that seems to be the one to use. \n\nTrue, I guess we can just pick one interpretation and use it.\nThough I would have picked the other interpretation: `if r1 == 1.. && r2 == ..2 {}` should probably be `if r1 == (1..) && r2 == (..2) {}`\nThe other choice would disambiguate it as `if r1 == (1.. (&& r2)) == ..2 {}`.\n\n> I'm starting to think we should keep the precedence as-is, so that .. must always be enclosed in parenthesis\n\nWhen I wrote that, I was just concerned about the complexity of having an optional expression in a chain of binops, but I think probably isn't as bad as I initially thought.\n\nThe only binops that potentially conflict with the initial token in an expression are: `&&`, `||`, `*`, `&` and `..` itself. (UFCS will add `<` and `<<`)\nOnly those with a precedence lower than `..` are problematic, so that's `&&` and `||` only.\nI don't see much use for ranges of double references or ranges of lambdas, so I'd add the following rule to disambiguate the formal grammar I've given:\nIf `..` is followed by a token that can be interpreted both as start of expression or binary operator, it will be parsed as:\n- start of expression if the interpretation as binop has a higher precedence than `..`\n- binary operator if it has a lower precedence than `..`\n\nThis corresponds to the disambiguation of `if r1 == 1.. && r2 == ..2 {}` as `if r1 == (1..) && r2 == (..2) {}`, but `1..*i` will be `1..(*i)`, not `(1..)*(i)`.\n",
