Forcing people to bind their own mapping/command to the function will just make it harder for non-vim-scripters to actually use the functionality.\n\nAs for `:make`, that won't be compatible with being able to run unnamed buffers (because it isn't designed for that). As for quickfix, I highly recommend using [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic). One interesting side-effect of how `:Run` works is it will trigger Syntastic warnings even for unnamed buffers (because the buffer temporarily gains a name), assuming you have Syntastic configured to check on save.\n",

I certainly agree with you that commands should be prefixed if they are global, but I'm not convinced that's necessary for buffer-local filteype-specific commands.\n\nAs an example of precedent, Vim's built-in `ftplugin/gitrebase.vim` (used for interactive Git rebases) defines a buffer-local set of commands `:Pick`/`:Squash`/`:Edit`/`:Reword`/`:Fixup`/`:Cycle`. This seems like official blessing for using unprefixed commands in this scenario.\n",

It seems mildly odd to require prefixes on commands when mappings tend to be more common and more likely to conflict.\n\nAnd that's why plugins shouldn't be creating default mappings _unless they are critical to the functioning of the plugin_ and even then, there must be a way for the user to customize the mapping the plugin creates. \n\nYou haven't allowed that in your plugin; it's `Run` or errors about conflicts.\n\n> Is there any authoritative source for this, or just your personal opinion/experience? I certainly agree with you that commands should be prefixed if they are global, but I'm not convinced that's necessary for buffer-local filteype-specific commands.\n\nIt's less necessary, but even such buffer-local commands conflict with global commands. I can guarantee you without a doubt that there's a non-trivial number of users out there with `Run` as a custom command in their vimrc. And theirs isn't buffer-local.\n\n> As an example of precedent, Vim's built-in ftplugin/gitrebase.vim (used for interactive Git rebases) defines a buffer-local set of commands :Pick/:Squash/:Edit/:Reword/:Fixup/:Cycle. This seems like official blessing for using unprefixed commands in this scenario.\n\nTim Pope is great, but IMO that was a bad call.\n\nIs renaming `Run` to something like `RustRun` such a big deal? I have more experience maintaining Vim plugins than I'd like to have and trust me when I tell you that anything that _can_ conflict _will_ conflict. You wouldn't believe the vimrcs out there.\n",

    "body": "> It reduces the usability of the command.\n\nVim commands are far better off being verbose and descriptive; if they're something the user wants to use often, they can trivially create a mapping: `noremap <F5> :RustRun<cr>`. Done. If they're used infrequently, then command completion works great.\n\nThis is the approach YCM uses (it even recommends custom mappings for commands) and I've _never_ had a single complaint about YCM command name lengths being so long that they hurt usability. And the names are _really_ long; one of the most frequently used YCM commands is `YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics`, but it's not an issue since everyone is encouraged to map it to something more convenient.\n\n> The plugin uses command! so it won't error out \n\nSo it will silently override the user's command. That's even worse; the problem with mappings silently overriding other mappings by default is the reason why we got `<unique>` as an argument to `map` (which causes a noisy conflict warning). If the `map` command were being implemented today, `<unique>` would be the default.\n\nIn other words, you _want_ to tell the user about a conflict so that they can resolve it instead of having something silently override.\n\n> Do you have any strong precedent you can cite for using prefixed command names in filetype plugins?\n\nI don't, but your argument boils down to \"Others have made this mistake before so why can't I make it too?\" I've lost track of the number of hacks I've had to add to YCM because other plugin authors haven't been as diligent as they should have.\n",

YCM creates several commands that could easily be filetype-specific (like `YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics`, `YcmDiags`, `YcmShowDetailedDiagnostic` etc). They're not registered only for specific filetypes because IMO I'd rather give the user a nicer YCM message about the command not being available for the current filetype than the ugly Vim error of \"command doesn't exist\" which users have reported as being confusing.\n\nAll of these commands have a `Ycm` prefix, and if I made them buffer-local tomorrow (as some of them were a long time ago), I'd still keep the prefix.\n",

    "body": "@Valloric You're citing as precedent a plugin (which I've never used, BTW) that appears to provide global behavior. I don't see how that's an appropriate precedent for filetype-specific buffer-local behavior.\n\nI appreciate that you have experience writing Vim plugins, but I just don't think your objections are particularly relevant to this case. It would make a lot of sense if this was a global command, or at least affected more than just one specific brand new filetype (e.g. if it were modifying an existing filetype then it would need to take more care not to step on the toes of anything else related to that filetype).\n\nI would really like to see some sort of valid precedent here for what you're arguing for. I've already shown precedent from Tim Pope, in source distributed with Vim itself, for doing exactly what I'm doing here.\n",
