The `Result<T, ()>` type is fairly rare (and uninformative); I'd like to make it ergonomic to get a meaningful error.\n\nI agree that we may want a variant with a closure, but for now adding a parameter for the error component seems like an improvement:\n\n``` rust\n// compare:\nopt.into_result()\nopt.into_result(())\n\n// compare:\nopt.into_result().map_err(|_| MyError)\nopt.into_result(MyError)\n```\n\nAlso, I'd like to think a bit about the name of this method. The corresponding `Result` methods are `ok` and `err`. Should we try to do something similar here? For example, we could use `some_or` and `some_or_else` (if we wanted to have the closure variant).\n\nFinally, we may be able to use a trick from the [collections reform RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/235) to drop _all_ of the closure variants.\n",

    "body": "Thinking about it it's interesting that I don't feel the need to prefix `ok` or `err` with \"into\" even though it's consuming the result. This may be because almost all methods on Result/Option consume the receiver, but it's also not actually saying what it's transforming into -- ok does not give you `Ok`, it gives you `Option<T>`.\n\nWe could possibly drop the `into_` prefix for just `result` because most other methods of `Option` don't have the prefix, but `foo.result(bar)` isn't quite so informative... I do agree with @aturon that taking the `E` of the `Result` as an argument is probably a good idea.\n",
