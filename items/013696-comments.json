    "body": "Apparently it was removed in 7a93beef7f692b34168ad69633f56483d38ad8fc.\n\nAnd that's too bad. Native support for quad precision floats made Rust special to me, like Fortran's `real(real128)` or Python's `numpy.float128`. Even if there aren't native instructions for 128 bit operations, there could be in the near future, and I like the sound of `i128`, `u128`, and `f128`.\n\nIf these features aren't anticipated then Rust might have to staple them on later, like C to C++.\n",
