    "body": "This is awesome work, it will be really nice to have the old crufty map API fully stripped out. :)\n\nThe `crateresolve7x` error only has a 50% chance of occurring, so it could just be that your build(s) missed it by chance. It's problematic even without changing the hash table, because the hash is determined by the order the dependencies get inserted. I think I'll just let that pull request go through, since it will be easy to rebase on top of anyway (only touches the crate hashes, the xfail test and the file removed in this one).\n\nI think this would be nice to have in 0.6 because switching away from the old copy-happy API is possibly a nice speed-up for the compiler... but the merge conflict gremlins probably have different plans.\n",
