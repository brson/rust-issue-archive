  "body": "Almost all languages provide some form of buffering of the stdout stream, and\nthis commit adds this feature for rust. A handle to stdout is lazily initialized\nin the Task structure as a buffered owned Writer trait object. The buffer\nbehavior depends on where stdout is directed to. Like C, this line-buffers the\nstream when the output goes to a terminal (flushes on newlines), and also like C\nthis uses a fixed-size buffer when output is not directed at a terminal.\n\nWe may decide the fixed-size buffering is overkill, but it certainly does reduce\nwrite syscall counts when piping output elsewhere. This is a _huge_ benefit to\nany code using logging macros or the printing macros. Formatting emits calls to\n`write` very frequently, and to have each of them backed by a write syscall was\nvery expensive.\n\nIn a local benchmark of printing 10000 lines of \"what\" to stdout, I got the\nfollowing timings:\n\n| when | terminal | redirected |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| before | 0.575s | 0.525s |\n| after | 0.197s | 0.013s |\n| C | 0.019s | 0.004s |\n\nI can also confirm that we're buffering the output appropriately in both\nsitutations. We're still far slower than C, but I believe much of that has to do\nwith the \"homing\" that all tasks due, we're still performing an order of\nmagnitude more write syscalls than C does.\n",
