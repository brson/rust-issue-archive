    "body": "Looks possible at the interface level. Currently this builtin is only used by test/run-pass/rt-sched-1.rs (testcase) and by libcore/task.rs (within spawn_raw). At both callsites the sched_id is ensured to be right, but a user might well crash the runtime by calling the builtin without going through the task library.\n\nEasiest \"fix\" would be to say the return value is maybe-null, return prematurely \"if we didn't get the sched\", add some nonnull asserts around the current callsites in rust code.\n",
