But associated constants, lifetimes and inherent items are not implemented.\n\nWe may want to break those into further issues, so we can triage each part separately. For example, I don't think associated constants need to be 1.0 (we can work around it reasonably in the libraries), but associated lifetimes probably are (because we intend not to allow lifetimes as \"input\" parameters on a trait, but you need some way to talk about them.)\n",
