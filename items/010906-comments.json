(E.g. I don't know if the instructions provided by the message actually correspond to what is helpful to us.)\n\nStill I think its worthwhile to give people a hint as to what they might investigate if they want to do more investigation on their own.  WIthout the RUST_LOG message from rustc, it might have been a lot longer before I started using its various modes for accessing the logging instrumentation in the binaries.   So I'd still be in favor of keeping some sort of message.\n",
