    "body": "The way I look at it is that the path API works with parsed, normalized paths, which consist of a number of components (between path separators). The entire API surface works this way. So `starts_with`, for example, implies that you could use `join` to get from the base path to the extended path -- and `join` likewise works at the _component_ level, inserting a separator for each call.\n\nI would rather add a `starts_with` method to `OsStr`, and then you can use `as_os_str()` to drop from a path view to a string view when you want that functionality.\n",
