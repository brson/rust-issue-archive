We allocate the exact space needed beforehand, and do the concatenation. An iterator implementation has this imperfection that we can't know how much memory to allocate beforehand -- this has a certain performance cost. It's almost Rust tradition to punt the issue until it can be resolved in the best way.\n\nAnd note, the string-joining functionality on iterators was implemented by a trait in collect-rs. [I've imported it](https://github.com/bluss/rust-itertools/commit/49af745253ebd8c0de02a062e27a1d7543f3cbe4) into itertools, so at least it's available there.\n",
