    "body": "So overall this looks really good. I'm happy about how small the diff became when we adopted the \"unify pos and neg impl\" approach. I feel like there should be more tests, but I'm not entirely sure what they ought to be. Maybe we can brainstorm some tricky scenarios. Here are some thoughts:\n1. I'd like to see another slightly less trivial coherence overlap  (e.g., `unsafe impl<T> Send for MyType<T>; impl !Send for MyType<int>`)\n2. I'd like to see a test for coherence orphan rules (e.g., `impl<T> !Send for Vec<T>`)\n3. I'd like to see a test where the \"!send\" thing is inside something else. Like, if `Foo` is !Send, test whether a struct Bar that wraps a Foo is send:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo;\nstruct Bar(Foo);\nimpl !Send for Foo;\nfn is_send<T:Send>();\nfn main() {\n    is_send::<Bar>(); //~ ERROR ...\n    is_send::<(int, Foo)>(); //~ ERROR ...\n    is_send::<Box<Foo>>(); //~ ERROR ...\n    is_send::<Box<Bar>>(); //~ ERROR ...\n\n}\n```\n\nI put the one minor nit about keeping the pos/neg impls in one list instead of two -- do you think there is a good reason to keep them separated?\n",

Most of the ones I can think of at the moment can be encoded as a special case of a decidable equality on types by piggybacking on the definitional equality. Once equality predicates in where clauses are implemented, that might actually be enough, assuming they can be negated and that the coherence check could use that to determine disjointness of the implementations.\n",
