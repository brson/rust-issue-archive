  "body": "The Windows failures in #22628 are caused by leftover threads blocking `stdtest.exe`; in both of these tests a thread is spawned that may outlive the main thread. We can't use a scoped thread here because these both test the behavior of panics in spawned threads, and with scoped threads we cannot panic the child without the parent panicking too.\n\nA twenty-second sleep for Windows ensures that the spawned thread will have exited.\n\nThis is only temporary (and is very much a hack), we probably should find a better solution to the issue of exes being blocked because they are in use, perhaps via the test runner.\n",
