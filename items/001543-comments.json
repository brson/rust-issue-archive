I think the consensus was to make _most_ warnings-and-errors controllable via an attribute, perhaps `#[warn(...)]` and `#[error(...)]`? If we do this, I don't mind keeping the `lint` source-module for \"miscellaneous checks\" but perhaps we can remove the `lint` attribute in favour of the `warn` and `error` ones?\n",
