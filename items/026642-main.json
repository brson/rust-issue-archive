  "body": "Setting append without write doesn't give you a writeable file. Showing it as an example in the docs is confusing at best ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3bbz8w/why_is_writing_a_file_not_working_for_me/))\n\nUsing truncate (O_TRUNC) on a read-only file is an error on POSIX systems (\"unspecified\"). Note however that using create (O_CREAT) with read-only flags is fine.\n\nRelated: #26103 (which IMHO is wrong; saying \"append is different than write\" when should simply be \"append needs write\". My vote is to make append imply write)\n",
