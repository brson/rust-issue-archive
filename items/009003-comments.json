Separate-crate, using a `test.rs`, would include the main crate with `extern mod`, and then have its own set of tests.\n\nIs the test crate compiled with `--test`? What if they want to use their own testrunner? Should we add a crate attribute to signal whether it should be tested with the builtin testrunner or as a normal executable?\n",
