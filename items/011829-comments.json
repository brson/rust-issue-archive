    "body": "Second the proposal.\n\nI tried this several times for a toy kernel written in Rust. Getting libstd to compile in free-standing mode is surprisingly easy; simply commenting out the dependency to `rtdeps` in `std/lib.rs` will do. But making it really work is another story all together. Two things blocked my effort so far:\n- The `assert!` and similar macros. They pull in all sort of platform specific dependencies, `std::rt::unwind`, `std::fmt`, etc.\n- The `std::fmt`, in turn, needs memory allocation (read: `~str` and `io::MemWriter`) and `condition!` macro, which depends on tls.\n\nSo yes, profiles part of the proposal should be relatively easy. But macro and owned box are used everywhere, it requires some serious refactoring.\n",

The core library, libcore, is entirely usable in kernel mode, as well as all libraries which are only dependent on libcore. I believe we've sliced out about as much as we're going to in order to get the standard library working in kernel mod, so I'm going to close this issue as being as complete as it can be.\n",
