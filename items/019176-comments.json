    "body": "@alexcrichton I've pushed an update that switches to by-value where it makes sense. There was literally _no_ fallout in all of the Rust distro (other than useless `mut` warnings). Given that we're splitting the trait (so these will be usable on trait objects), and that you can use `by_ref` (which should be _very_ rare when using a consuming operation) this seems like a pure win from a clarify/bug catching perspective.\n\nI've also tweaked the stability attributes of `MinMaxResult` since we'll probably want to revisit the naming in an enum sweep.\n\nI'm leaving `peekable`/`Peekable` stable, since the changes you talked about would actually only affect `take_while`. (Note that `skip_while` works fine.) There are a few options for revising the semantics, but I want to visit that issue in a second pass; I've left a note so we remember to do so.\n",
