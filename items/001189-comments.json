    "body": "I've implemented linked failure using an exclusive ARC per task-group (soon to be several per), rather than messages. Killing is done with a call into the runtime, `rust_task_kill_other` (and in rare cases, `rust_task_kill_all`).\n\nA problem with implementing this using messages is that to be killed at any time, a task must always be implicitly reading from some sort of failure port. This could maybe be done to allow tasks to get kicked awake from blocked-on-ports, using \"implicitly select2(port, failure_port)\" -- but starts getting fuzzier when compiler-inserted yield checks come into play.\n\nSo I think using the current model of the exclusive arc, the kill_other builtin, and checking for killed at yield-points is the way to go, instead of messages.\n\nFeel free to reopen if you disagree.\n",
