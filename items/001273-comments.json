Even requiring an explicit type wouldn't be so bad, but some simple shorthands would help (e.g. \"let x : mutable\" would constrain the type to be mutable, but would get the rest of its type from inference (e.g. \"mutable int\" or whatever)).\n\nI kind of like that you have to type a few more characters for mutable variables. It adds some slight pressure to avoid them.In my one simple rust app (a raytracer) I found that over 90% of local variables were immutable. \n\nAlso, IMO, mutable variables are a significant detriment to readability. The more times a variable is changed, the more \"what-ifs\" you have to consider when interpreting its potential values when reading the code. Making it slightly painful (though not too painful!) to allow mutation could be a good thing.\n",

    "body": "My preference would be to make it roughly \"twice as ugly\" as immutable locals, whatever that means :-).. I'd want it to be pretty damn ugly so people would avoid it if they don't _really_ need it, and so that it stands out better when you read it, but not ugly enough that you'd feel it was clunky for the few cases where you do need it. For me that probably means I'd prefer the full \"mutable\" keyword instead of \"mut\" or \"var\". Easy enough to change the name of a keyword in retrospect though, the important part is making the distinction at all.\n",
