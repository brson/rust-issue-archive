  "body": "Well, this was fun. I'm fairly sure I got this right, but I'll add a comment to a part I'm not too sure about.\n\nThis adds a few missing integral types to (lib)libc.\n\nWhat was added is the following:\n- ULONG\n- ULONG_PTR\n- LONGLONG\n- ULONGLONG (required for a coming-soon pull request :+1:)\n- LONG32\n- LONG64\n\n---\n\nI added another commit, which adds the following named types:\n- INT\n- INT8\n- INT16\n- INT32\n- INT64\n- UINT\n- UINT8\n- UINT16\n- UINT32\n- UINT64\n\nThis is a change made in advance for a future PR series that starts working on Fiber support (_first_ in Windows). I don't have it anywhere near a working state, but if I make these changes now, I won't have to wait for these changes. It will take a while to get it right :(\n",
