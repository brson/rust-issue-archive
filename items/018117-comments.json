    "body": "Because `CString` basically doesn't write anything into the memory chunk pointed by `buf`, I think taking `*const c_char` as an argument is OK.  And dereferencing a raw pointer is always `unsafe` regardless whether it's `mut` or `const`, after all.\n\nHowever I also felt unconfortable with `CString::new()` and want to split it into two functions.  Choosing a correct one from either `CString::new(buf, true)` or `CString::new(buf, false)` is a mental burden (bor both of reading and writing.)  In fact, we rarely want to parametrize the 2nd argument;  for example, all 25 invocations of `CString::new()` in `rust/src` used literal `true` or `false`.\n\nMy idea is naming them `CString::as_owner(buf)` (for the `true` case) and `CString::as_view(buf)` (for the `false` case) but I don't know how they sound to native English speakers.  It may be unclear they are so-called constructors.\n",
