    "body": "@pnkfelix I think I descibred that really badly. I'm basically suggesting that given `extern mod foo;`, we stop accepting `foo::...` and require `::foo::...` (or `use foo;` before `foo::...`), so making all crate items require absolute paths even when referencing them in the crate root. I would also then suggest not allowing `extern crate` items outside the crate root so they all exist in the outermost scope. I'm basically weirded out by external crates seemingly being nested within the current crate next to any normal item, rather than existing on the same nesting level as the whole of the current crate. The more I think about it, the less this whole plan sounds like a good idea, though.\n\nThat wouldn't address the problem that rust-lang/rfcs#110 tries to solve at all, you'd still need a mechanism to ensure that the same crate is referenced by the same path in completely different compilation units.\n",
