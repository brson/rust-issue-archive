    "body": "Unfortunately valgrind is known to have false positives for checks like this (it's a well known bug between valgrind/LLVM), and this comes as a result of optimized code. It ends up not actually causing problems, and the exact functions which hit this codegen pattern tend to shift over time.\n\nRegardless though I remember investigating this in the past and seeing that it was a false positive, so I don't think there's an issue to resolve here.\n",
