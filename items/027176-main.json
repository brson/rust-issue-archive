  "body": "This commit moves the IR files in the distribution, rust_try.ll,\nrust_try_msvc_64.ll, and rust_try_msvc_32.ll into the compiler from the main\ndistribution. There's a few reasons for this change:\n- LLVM changes its IR syntax from time to time, so it's very difficult to\n  have these files build across many LLVM versions simultaneously. We'll likely\n  want to retain this ability for quite some time into the future.\n- The implementation of these files is closely tied to the compiler and runtime\n  itself, so it makes sense to fold it into a location which can do more\n  platform-specific checks for various implementation details (such as MSVC 32\n  vs 64-bit).\n- This removes LLVM as a build-time dependency of the standard library. This may\n  end up becoming very useful if we move towards building the standard library\n  with Cargo.\n\nIn the immediate future, however, this commit should restore compatibility with\nLLVM 3.5 and 3.6.\n",
