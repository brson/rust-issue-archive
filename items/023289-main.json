  "body": "This adds search by type (for functions/methods) support to Rustdoc. Target issue is at https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/658.\n\nI've described my approach here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/658#issuecomment-76484200. I'll copy the text in here as well:\n\n---\n\nHi, it took me longer than I wished, but I have implemented this in a not-too-complex way that I think can be extended to support more complex features (like the ones mentioned [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/12866#issuecomment-66945317)).\n\nThe idea is to generate a JSON representation of the types of methods/functions in the existing index, and then make the JS understand when it should look by type (and not by name).\n\nI tried to come up with a JSON representation that can be extended to support generics, bounds, ref/mut annotations and so on. Here are a few samples:\n\nFunction:\n\n``` rust\nfn to_uppercase(c: char) -> char\n```\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"inputs\": [\n        {\"name\": \"char\"}\n    ],\n    \"output\": {\n        \"name\": \"char\",\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMethod (implemented or defined in trait):\n\n``` rust\n// in struct Vec\n// self is considered an argument as well\nfn capacity(&self) -> usize\n```\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"inputs\": [\n        {\"name\": \"vec\"}\n    ],\n    \"output\": {\n        \"name\": \"usize\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis simple format can be extended by adding more fields, like `generic: bool`, a `bounds` mapping and so on.\n\nI have a working implementation in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/compare/master...mihneadb:rustdoc-search-by-type. You can check out a live demo [here](http://data.mihneadb.net/doc/std/index.html?search=charext%20-%3E%20char).\n\n![screenshot from 2015-02-28 00 54 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/643127/6422722/7e5374ee-bee4-11e4-99a6-9aac3c9d5068.png)\n\nThe feature list is not that long:\n- search by types (you _can_ use generics as well, as long as you use the exact name - e.g. [`vec,t ->`](http://data.mihneadb.net/doc/std/index.html?search=vec%2C%20t%20-%3E))\n- order of arguments does not matter\n- `self` is took into account as well (e.g. search for `vec -> usize`)\n- does not use \"complex\" annotations (e.g. you don't search for `&char -> char` but for `char -> char`)\n\nMy goal is to get a working, minimal \"base\" merged so that others can build upon it. How should I proceed? Do I open a PR (badly in need of code review since this is my first non \"hello world\"-ish rust code)?\n\n---\n",
