  "body": "This PR creates a new lint : `unused_extern_crate`, which do pretty much the same thing as `unused_import`, but for `extern crate` statements. It is related to feature request #10385.\n\nI adapted the code tracking used imports so that it tracks extern crates usage as well. This was mainly trial and error and while I believe all cases are covered, there might be some code I added that is useless (long compile times didn't give me the opportunity to check this in detail).\n\nAlso, I removed some unused `extern crate` statements from the libs, that where spotted by this new lint.\n",
