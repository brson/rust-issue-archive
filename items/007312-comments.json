    "body": "Wouldn't a better name for 'fn init()' be 'fn default()'? There are already some `fn init()`s methods in the source (`libstd/vec.rs`, `libstd/rand.rs`) that take arguments, and also some functions (`libstd/vec.rs`, `libstd/rt/mod.rs`, `libstd/rt/logging.rs`) that do. Whereas 'fn default' has only 2 matches in the entire rust source (`librustc/middle/check_match.rs`, `libsyntax/abi.rs`), neither of which is likely to be used by existing user-code at this time.\nAlso I think it's a nice convention for these 'one method' traits to have the name of the method be the same as the name of the trait.\n",
