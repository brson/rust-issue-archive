    "body": "Yes that would be a good idea but we need to do a few things in order for GDB to actually use the pretty printers:\n1. The folder containing the pretty printer Python module must be in PYTHONPATH for the GDB instance, so the Python runtime can find it.\n2. There are 2 ways of telling GDB to use a pretty printer automatically:\n   1. There has to be a file next to the executable/dynlib with the same name + `-gdb.py`. GDB will automatically load and execute this file when the binary is loaded--iff the file is in GDB's _auto-loading safe path_. This file is normally used to load and register the pretty printer. The pretty printer module too has to be in the auto-loading safe path.\n   2. The second option of telling GDB to use the pretty printer is via a special `.debug_gdb_scripts` section in the binary. This section must contain a list of scripts to load, among which the activation of the pretty printer can be.\n\nSo, in order to make this usable, we need to make sure that the pretty printer Python modules is added to some location in the Rust installation then make sure to add these locations to GDB auto-loading safe path. I guess the best way to do this would be to provide a shell-script that starts GDB with the additional needed parameters (see the scripts the autotesting framework creates). You would then call GDB via `rgdb ...` to start it in Rust mode. Alternatively we could let `make install` modify `~/.gdbinit` to always add the directories to the safe path, but I think that's a bit intrusive.\n\nWe would also have to make sure that rustc either creates the auto-loading script or adds the `.debug_gdb_scripts` section to the executable. I'm not sure yet, which of these is the better option.\n",

    "body": "OK, this works on the try branch now. I've added the possibility to require a minimum GDB version for debuginfo tests. If the GDB version used is too low, the test is ignored. \nFor now, there are two separate GDB pretty printer test cases, one that only tests things that older GDB versions can handle (which excludes tuples and enums) and a second one that does more exhaustive testing.\nUnfortunately, it's not really straightforward to reliably find out GDB's version, as the version string can have different formats. On the test bots on OSX it's:\n\n```\nGNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1824) (Wed Feb  6 22:51:23 UTC 2013)\n```\n\nOn the linux build bot it seems to be:\n\n```\n(7.4-2012.04-0ubuntu2)\n```\n\nAnd locally on my machine it's:\n\n```\nGNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.7-0ubuntu3.1) 7.7\n```\n\nThis will definitely need some more work in the future. I'm not sure if this is ready to merge yet :/\n",

The extraction algorithm can now handle all GDB version string formats I have seen so far (including the one on my local Windows installation), so this should be good to go. \n",
