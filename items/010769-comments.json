    "body": "@pnkfelix I've updated the tests gist since then, but I don't have many real use cases, because there is no way to express that a generic type parameter must be a tuple (so nothing function-related, like tuple structs or enum variants, works), that will come in the last step (the actual variadicity, `<..T>`).\nI would prefer to split the implementation into 4 parts (`..TupleType`, `..tuple_value`, `..tuple_binder` in patterns and `<..T>`), but that's not fixed yet.\n\nThat said, there are a couple of problems I would like to address at this moment: the lack of a span for `fn` and `impl` errors (which come from `TypeFolder`) and the potential for mishandling `..T` as `T` further in `rustc::middle` (I've added a couple of asserts, but I'm not sure they are the right thing).\n",
