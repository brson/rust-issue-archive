For example, gcc's `-Os` option implies `-O2` plus the size-for-speed tradeoff optimizations.\n\nAnd it hopefully won't be `-Z lto` forever. I admit link time optimizations are somewhat orthogonal to earlier optimizations. What about an additional argument to `opt-level` like `--opt-level 3l`, or `--lto`?\n",
