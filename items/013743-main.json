  "body": "Two new methods were added to TcpStream and UnixStream:\n\n```\nfn close_read(&mut self) -> IoResult<()>;\nfn close_write(&mut self) -> IoResult<()>;\n```\n\nThese two methods map to shutdown()'s behavior (the system call on unix),\nclosing the reading or writing half of a duplex stream. These methods are\nprimarily added to allow waking up a pending read in another task. By closing\nthe reading half of a connection, all pending readers will be woken up and will\nreturn with EndOfFile. The close_write() method was added for symmetry with\nclose_read(), and I imagine that it will be quite useful at some point.\n\nImplementation-wise, librustuv got the short end of the stick this time. The\nnative versions just delegate to the shutdown() syscall (easy). The uv versions\ncan leverage uv_shutdown() for tcp/unix streams, but only for closing the\nwriting half. Closing the reading half is done through some careful dancing to\nwake up a pending reader.\n\ncc #11165\n",
