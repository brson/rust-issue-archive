    "body": "A thought: from the description, it sounds like super-reviews could primarily target _bugs/issues_, not for the pull requests themselves.  Super-review might not be necessary for the pull requests themselves for pre-approved issues, at least not by default.\n\n(no need to read further if you agree.)\n\n#### Elaboration on that thought\n\nWe may want the policy to differ between pull requests that link to one or more pre-existing, pre-approved issues, versus a pull request that has been put up without a link to the issues that it fixes (or with links solely to issues that have not been acknowledged by the core dev team).\n\nIn the former case, I think the reviewer could be given the freedom to judge: \n1. does the patch solves the issue in question,\n2. was there core dev approval on the issue's ticket for a language/API change as part of fixing the issue, and \n3. were there constraints or expected implementation strategies for the solution noted on the linked issues, and if so, does the patch satisfy them?\n\nIf the reviewer answers yes for all three questions, then they should not need to wait for super-review.\n\n(In the latter case where a pull request does not link to pre-approved issues, a reviewer might still decide a pull-request can land without super-review; I'm just saying we can put looser standards in place for the former case.)\n\nSuch flexibility in policy might help avoid blocking pull requests from landing in the cases where the problem and the path to a solution is known ahead of time.\n\n(And then for modules where the code is known to be tricky, the core dev team can leave notes on the tickets saying that super-review is required for associated pull requests, presumably cc'ing the relevant super-reviewers.)\n",
