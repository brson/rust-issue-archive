This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "... but to change it to `u32`, you need to update all the other places that are using `usize`.  Grep for `panic_fmt` -- for example, the `libstd/rt/unwind.rs` code uses `usize` for the line number.  I'm pretty sure `panic_fmt` also shows up in the docs.  The compiler knows about the `panic_fmt` lang item, but I don't know whether it expects a particular type signature; I'm guessing not?\n\nThe `line as u32` cast isn't necessary.\n\nI think it'll be necessary to use the `#[cfg(stage0)]` / `#[cfg(not(stage0))]` tags, so we can keep using `usize` for the stage0 libraries while using `u32` for the stage1 and stage2 libraries.  For example, see this commit: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/647e54d6d154e1a267e84c8ae9f1315e3f9b93fc\n",
