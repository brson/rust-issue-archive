We're actively redesigning the I/O system in a set of new RFCs. Currently one does not exist for `std::net` yet (it was part of the original monster-RFC), but I'll try to remember to ping this once that pops up!\n\nWe'll try to remember to handle this case as well, as I'm sure you're not the only one wanting this functionality! For now though I'm going to close this while we consider the new I/O system and we hope to have that RFC up soon!\n",

Adding this sort of behavior will likely not be done through a new `bind_reusable` constructor but rather a more general mechanism of starting with a `Socket`, settings some options, and then later binding or connecting it into a `UdpSocket` or `TcpStream` for example.\n\nThese sorts of additions are definitely planned for, but are all backwards compatible extensions to the API. An RFC will be required, however, to add this new API as it was not explicitly designed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/807\n",
