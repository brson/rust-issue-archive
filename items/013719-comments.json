    "body": "I've used R before and was well aware of its logo, but I'd never actually made that association before. Maybe I'm biased? I think the current sprocket-based logo is \"industrial-y\" enough that this confusion is unlikely.\n\nI'm actually a little wary of even leaving this issue open. Arguing over logo design has the capability to spiral into a bikeshed the likes of which we've never seen before. The fact that we currently have a logo that is not just not-terrible, but actually somewhat _charming_ is nothing short of a miracle.\n",
