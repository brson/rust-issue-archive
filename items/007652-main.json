  "body": "This is a new doubly-linked list using owned nodes. In the forward direction, the list is linked with owned pointers, and the backwards direction is linked with &'static Node pointers.\n\nThis intends to replace the previous extra::DList that was using managed nodes and also featured freestanding nodes.  The new List does not give access to the nodes, but means to implement all relevant linked-list methods.\n\nThe list supports pop_back, push_back, pop_front, push_front, front, back, iter, mut_iter, +more iterators,  append, insert_ordered, and merge.\n- Add a trait Deque for double ended sequences.\n- Both List and Deque implement this trait. Rename Deque to ArrayDeque.\n\n_The text has been updated to summarize resolved items_\n## RFC Topics\n### Resolved\n- Should be in extra\n- Representation for the backlinks\n### Container Method Names and Trait Names and Type Names\n- Location and name of trait `extra::collection::Deque`?\n- Name of the ring buffer `extra::deque::ArrayDeque` ?\n- Name of the doubly linked list `extra::dlist::List` ?\n\nFor container methods I think we have two options:\n- Align with the existing methods on the vector. That would be `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`.\n- Use the API described in https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Containers   Obviously that's the way List is written right now.\n\nShould we use `pop_front() -> Option<T>` or `pop_front() -> T` ?\n### Benchmarks\n\nSome basic bench numbers for List vs. Vec, Deque and _old DList_\n\nThis List implementation's performance is dominated by the allocation of Nodes required when pushing. \n\nIterate (by-ref) collection of 128 elements\n\n```\ntest test_bench::bench_iter ... bench: 198 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest test_bench::bench_iter_mut ... bench: 294 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest test_bench::bench_iter_rev ... bench: 198 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest test_bench::bench_iter_mut_rev ... bench: 198 ns/iter (+/- 3)\n\ntest test_bench::bench_iter_vec ... bench: 101 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest test_bench::bench_iter_deque ... bench: 581 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest test_bench::bench_iter_dlist ... bench: 9262 ns/iter (+/- 273)\n```\n\nSequence of `.push(elt)`, `.pop()` or equivalent at the tail end\n\n```\ntest test_bench::bench_push_back_pop_back ... bench: 72 ns/iter (+/- 0)\n\ntest test_bench::bench_push_back_pop_back_vec ... bench: 5 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest test_bench::bench_push_back_pop_back_deque ... bench: 15 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest test_bench::bench_push_back_pop_back_dlist ... bench: 234 ns/iter (+/- 0)\n```\n",
