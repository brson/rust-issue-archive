    "body": "I believe const pointers are still an important part of borrowck. AIUI, if you write a function that takes a `&T`, purity gets involved if you want to call it when what you have is a `&mut T`. But if the function can be written to take a `&const T`, it can be called more easily / in more cases(?).\n\nMaybe the thing it makes most sense to rename is `const`-the-kind, the one that means \"no mutable fields inside\". It is kind of like send/owned in that regard (\"The type structure does not have this thing inside it\").\n",
