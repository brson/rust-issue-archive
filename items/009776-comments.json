    "body": "@catamorphism are you ok closing this? I feel like stack overflow is handled through better methods than signals, and in the default case it should never practically get hit (unless you have an infinite recursion). The behavior right now will be mitigated once we've sorted out the segmented stack issue, which will albeit not be in the near future, but it should in theory happen soon-ish.\n",
