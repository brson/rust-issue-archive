  "body": "As per #26009 this PR implements a new collation system for extended-error metadata. I've tried to keep it as simple as possible for now, so there's no uniqueness checking and minimal modularity.\n\nAlthough using a lint was discussed in #26009 I decided against this because it would require converting the AST output from the plugin back into an internal data-structure. Emitting the metadata from within the plugin prevents this double-handling. We also didn't identify this as the source of the failures last time, although something untoward was definitely happening... With that in mind I would like as much feedback as possible on this before it's merged, I don't want to break the bots again!\n\nI've successfully built for my host architecture and I'm building an ARM cross-compiler now to test my assumptions about the various `CFG` variables. Despite the confusing name of `CFG_COMPILER_HOST_TRIPLE` it is actually the compile time target triple, as explained in `mk/target.mk`.\n\n```\n# This is the compile-time target-triple for the compiler. For the compiler at\n# runtime, this should be considered the host-triple. More explanation for why\n# this exists can be found on issue #2400\nexport CFG_COMPILER_HOST_TRIPLE\n```\n\nCC @pnkfelix @brson @nrc @alexcrichton \n\nCloses #25705, closes #26009.\n",
