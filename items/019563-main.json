  "body": "One of the causes of #19501 was that the metadata on OSX was getting corrupted.\nFor any one particular invocation of the compiler the metadata file inside of an\nrlib archive would have extra bytes appended to the end of it. These extra bytes\nend up confusing rbml and have it run off the end of the array (resulting in the\nout of bounds detected).\n\nThis commit prepends the length of metadata to the start of the metadata to\nensure that we always slice the precise amount that we want, and it also\nun-ignores the test from #19502.\n\nCloses #19501\n",
