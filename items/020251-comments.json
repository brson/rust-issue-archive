    "body": "Duplicate of #19035 (also see #8280)\n\n> Is this intended behaviour?\n\nIt's a known bug. The compiler relies on the type of the LHS when type checking a binary operator, and when it sees a primitive type (like `f32`) on the LHS it tries to use the built-in operation, rather than the overloaded one, which expects the RHS to have the same type as the LHS.\n\nThe workaround is to always put your type on the LHS for commutative ops and just use the unsugared method call for the other binary ops.\n\nI got a fix on #19434, but the reviewer is currently busy revamping the associated types feature, so it may take a little longer to land.\n",
