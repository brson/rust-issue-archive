Before I didn't know which version to install.... now I know which version, but it still doesn't help me at all.\n\nI like Rust when it is on Linux, however the windows install of it just isn't ready for general use, you don't get cargo by default, and mingw is currently it's own special kind of hell.\n\nI know there is a plan to bundle cargo, can we bundle a more complete mingw as well?\n",
