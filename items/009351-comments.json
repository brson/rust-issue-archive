As I recall the only reason Cell wasn't removed was the problem with closures, and because it was used in Servo?\nSome relevant IRC logs: https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust/msg/2818497/\nI couldn't find the older one with a conversation I had with pcwalton (I think it was before [o__o] joined the rust irc channel and irclog.gr has a really crappy search interface.\n",

    "body": "I'm working on this at https://github.com/blake2-ppc/rust/compare/mutable-t\n- I'm gradually replacing Cell. The pattern `Cell::new(x)` with an immediate `cell.take()` is overwhelmingly common. Should Cell still be its own type for just that pattern?\n- The BorrowFlag should be smaller than the current 2 x uint..\n- Should `Mut<T>` have the cell like interface for `Mut<Option<U>>`? Indeed Cell seems simple enough for many of its uses, and Mut might only complement the cases where you need to borrow a held value.\n- Even empty destructors like the one of `NonCopyable` will insert a destructor function call, and this should be the only overhead of Mut over Cell for the simplest use cases.\n",
