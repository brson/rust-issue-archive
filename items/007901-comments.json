    "body": "I think that this would be fairly difficult to do, and the semantics should definitely be fleshed out before any work is done.\n\nWhen translating, if there's a spot which uses the `exchange_malloc` lang item, then LLVM has to emit some call to something at that point. I think that this means that normal name-mangling couldn't happen for lang items because otherwise you're emitting a call to something you can't override.\n\nOne possible route to take that has other benefits would be to canonicalize all lang_item names to the same value. Something like `__lang_item_<name of lang item>`. I'm not quite sure how things like tcmalloc/jemalloc work by dynamically loading them at runtime and everything uses them, but this could probably work along the same lines (everyone assumes the memory allocation function is called `malloc`). Another benefit of this would be that a library crate could be compiled with a _dependence_ on lang items, but not actually define them itself.\n\nSo we could create a `libcore` which is `libstd - librustrt` or something like that, but it could still have methods for things like `~str` and `~[T]` _without_ defining the lang_item for allocation. Whenever you linked against it, you would be required to define the symbol, but at compile-time for the crate it wouldn't matter. Not only would this be hugely beneficial for allocation functions, but it'd be fantastic if `libcore` could still use `fail!()`. Programs linking against `libcore` (like kernels) would have to define what exactly they want to happen whenever a `fail!()` occurs (or an out-of-bounds exception)\n\nBasically\n- I'm not sure if this is possible without canonicalizing the names of lang_items (functions make sense, do traits?)\n- If we do that, we could extend this to make missing lang_items even more flexible!\n\nI'm curious how feasible this is. What do others think?\n",

    "body": "You can't rely on the same trick used by `tcmalloc` and `jemalloc` because it implies dynamic linking. It only works if the application dynamically links against the standard C library and it uses weak symbols. The real solution for the allocator is to use the `je_` prefix and extend LLVM's detection of `malloc` and `free` to them.\n",
