    "body": "Just as a note, I think both types are _ because rustc doesn't know exactly what types they actually _are_. The `1` could be any number type really, from `u8` to `i64`, and the `0.0` could be either `f32` or `f64`. It should have a better way of describing this, yes, but I don't think it's exactly clear what exactly it _should_ be saying instead of `_`. Since it doesn't know what either of them are, it is surprising that it doesn't assume the 1 to be an f32/f64 as well.\n",
