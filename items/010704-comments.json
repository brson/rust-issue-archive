As `RWArc::read` is almost the same thing as using \n`Arc`, this code works quite well. I tried to use `Arc` in tasks for \nread only data, and writing in one unique task reading messages, but it \nis slower (by memory, 10% slower) and more complicated.\n\nI didn't profile the code, but it seems that most of the time spend is \nin the `A` function.\n",
