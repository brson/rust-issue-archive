  "body": "See #24387. \n\nThis is a port of the first PR (#21406) to the current master branch. I also added a commit to change the characters to use WGL4 instead, as suggested in the comment thread of the original PR, since those are more widely supported.\n\nThe proposal that was more or less accepted was to remove the `--color` and `--drawing` options and replace them with environment variables and a single `--output-plain-ascii` option. The problem is that `--color` still exists, and a stable option. I left `--drawing` for now, for consistency with `--color` but there are maybe better options.\n\nThis PR is not yet ready to be merged but I wanted to post it to have feedback on this issue. The proposal also included auto-enabling Unicode output when writing to a terminal and LC_CTYPE ends with `.UTF-8`. I'll implement this if there is still agreement that this should be done.\n\ncc @Manishearth.\n\n(PS: I did not change the author of the commits since I did not implement the Unicode outputting itself, but the commits from the original PR needed a lot of fixes to build on the current master branch, maybe I should have. Let me know if I should. Doing a separate commit was also possible but generated a huge diff of duplicate modifications.)\n",
