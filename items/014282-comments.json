    "body": "@tamird I filed this issue almost a year ago. I don't recall the circumstances surrounding it, beyond what I put in the ticket. From re-reading this, I'm pretty sure that what I was saying is that if a syntax extension uses `quote_expr!()` after having previously invoked `cx.span_err()` it aborts immediately, instead of continuing the macro expansion phase (`span_err()` usually doesn't abort the compilation until the end of the macro expansion phase; I think `quote_expr!()` is basically recursively invoking the macro expansion phase and therefore aborting after the recursive invocation ends).\n",
