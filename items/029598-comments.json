    "body": "> Is there a home-run example of a problem that would be difficult to debug without the added information of what a macro expanded into?\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's a \"home run\", but I'll give an example. First some background. There are two cases where I think the output is helpful:\r\n\r\n1. Usually if I'm debugging a macro, it is because something is not expanding the way I expect. To fix this, I need to know (a) which expansion is misbehaving; (b) what part of the expansion is wrong. Seeing the output helps tremendously with both.\r\n\r\n2. Sometimes a macro expands to rather a lot of code (often an `impl`) and something in there triggers a compile error. The error message shows the line number of the original macro call in the source\u2014useless. I want to see what the Rust compiler sees.\r\n\r\nNow my example. Once in a while I write `$x:expr` in a macro template when of course I should write `$x`. Dumb; but for some reason I tend to overlook this bug when I'm staring at the macro definition. If I use `trace_macros!`, the `to:` output makes it *really* jump out at me. The `:expr` in the buggy output is a dead giveaway; it doesn't look anything like correct Rust code.\r\n",
