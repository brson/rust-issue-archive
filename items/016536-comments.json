    "body": "\"error 34\" is ENOENT - effectively, \"No such file or directory\".  Just offhand, can you check if the various paths in that command actually exist?  E.g. does `c:\\Users\\xmasotto\\coding\\rust\\i686-pc-mingw32\\llvm\\Release+Asserts/lib` exist?  Also, it looks like the path to LLVM is given as a Windows-style path, and the path to the Rust source is given as a Unix-y path - I wonder if that might be the issue...\n",
