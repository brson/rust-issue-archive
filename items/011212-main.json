  "body": "For libgreen, bookeeping should not be global but rather on a per-pool basis.\nInside libnative, it's known that there must be a global counter with a\nmutex/cvar.\n\nThe benefit of taking this strategy is to remove this functionality from libstd\nto allow fine-grained control of it through libnative/libgreen. Notably, helper\nthreads in libnative can manually decrement the global count so they don't count\ntowards the global count of threads. Also, the shutdown process of _all_ sched\npools is now dependent on the number of tasks in the pool being 0 rather than\nthis only being a hardcoded solution for the initial sched pool in libgreen.\n\nThis involved adding a Local::try_take() method on the Local trait in order for\nthe channel wakeup to work inside of libgreen. The channel send was happening\nfrom a SchedTask when there is no Task available in TLS, and now this is\npossible to work (remote wakeups are always possible, just a little slower).\n",
