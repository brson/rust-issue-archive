  "body": "Visual Studio 2015, recently released, includes the Universal CRT, a different\nflavor than was provided before. The binaries and header files for this library\nare included in new locations not previously known about by gcc-rs, and this\ncommit adds support for the necessary probing to find these.\n\nUnfortunately there are no prior examples of this probing to be found in\nframeworks like CMake or clang, so this is done is a bit of a sketchy method\ntoday. It assumes that the installation is in a relatively standard format and\nthen blindly looks for the location of the UCRT. I'd love to switch this over to\nusing registry keys for probing, but I was currently unable to find such keys.\n\nThis should enable the compiler to work outside VS 2015 dev tools prompts.\n",
