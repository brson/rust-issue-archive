  "body": "Now that MSVC support has landed in the most recent nightlies we can now have\nMSVC bootstrap itself without going through a GNU compiler first. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the bootstrap currently fails due to the compiler not being able to\nfind the llvm-ar.exe tool during the stage0 libcore compile. The compiler cannot\nfind this tool because it's looking inside a directory that does not exist:\n\n```\n$SYSROOT/rustlib/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/bin\n```\n\nThe `gnu` on this triple is because the bootstrap compiler's host architecture\nis GNU. The build system, however, only arranges for the llvm-ar.exe tool to be\navailable in this location:\n\n```\n$SYSROOT/rustlib/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/bin\n```\n\nTo resolve this discrepancy, the build system has been modified to understand\ntriples that are bootstrapped from another triple, and in this case copy the\nnative tools to the right location.\n",
