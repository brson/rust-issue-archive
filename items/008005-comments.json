    "body": "I had a look at this issue and I was wondering how (and if) a single semicolon in a line is represented in the AST?\n My first approach to solve this issue was passing the body block of the function to `check_ret` and check if the last statement is a single semicolon. (the code, which prints the number of statements in a block from `check_ret` can be found here: https://github.com/fhahn/rust/commit/4033420248270a7fe8eb25f7286c90965d9992f9)\nBut it seems there is no statement for a single semicolon. Is it possible that a single semicolon gets dropped from the AST?\n",
