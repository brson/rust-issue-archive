    "body": "Anything about indexing should be minimal and should be _very_ strongly suggesting that you shouldn\u2019t be doing this in the first place. Almost always, a string should be opaque data. Iteration is just about the only way you should ever do such things, and even iteration should very seldom be done.\n\nAlternatives that may serve certain purposes are `begins_with` and `ends_with`, and `graphemes()` will need to be mentioned.\n\n---\n\nAs for comparison, UTF-8 has the convenient property that bitwise comparison yields the same answers as codepoint comparison. Of course there is still the question of composed versus decomposed characters and so on and so forth\u2026 the simple summary is that you really shouldn\u2019t be doing comparisons, either.\n\nPeople want to do all these operations on strings, but it seems to me that the more experienced you get, the more you realise that these sorts of operations are all unsound and should never really be done.\n",

    "body": "The string guide should have some common use cases and the rust-ish (rusty?  oxidi-shous?) way described.  My case is this:\n\nI want to take a string (e.g. a url) and use it to do something not too complex (e.g. authenticate to the AWS S3 api).  This involves taking the url, and deciding based on the url which of the two available formats will be used, and returning the string that will be used to determine the signature of the request.\n\nThis means some slicing and dicing.  Coming from python/ruby/go/clojure (even C) the easiest answer is to split the string and compare to known values (e.g. does the hostname bit of the URL start with \"s3.amazonaws.com\") which lends itself naturally to a match.  The odd part is that I pass in one kind of string (an &str) , and get another kind out (a String) where I need to be familiar with a whole different set of traits vs. &str.  My understanding is that I should prefer String types, and I can see this being a common idiom - so much so that there should probably be some agreement on how something like this could be made more obvious:\n\n``` rust\nfn bucket_name_from_path <'a>(path: &'a str) -> String {\n    let parts: Vec<&str> = path.split_str(\"/\").collect();\n    return match parts.get(0).slice_from(0) {\n        \"s3.amazonaws.com\" =>  parts.get(1).to_string(),\n        _ => name_from_vhost_style(*parts.get(0))\n    }\n}\nfn name_from_vhost_style <'a>(vhostname: &'a str) -> String {\n    let hostname_parts: Vec<&str> = vhostname.split_str(\".\").collect::<Vec<&str>>();\n    let bucket_parts = hostname_parts.slice(0, hostname_parts.len() - 2);\n    return bucket_parts.connect(\"\");\n}\n```\n\nI would like to have documented where the convention should be to place type conversions via to_str() and collect() etc.  It would be nice to just be able to say that e.g. I should just convert &str strings to String and document which operations on a String are similar to common string operations in other languages (comparisons, splitting, joining, tokenizing, etc.), explain the slice types and how to operate with them (and why they exist) and just overall make it so that there is a clear path to doing common things the easy way.\n",

Why is an str a u8 slice, rather than chars, and why IS there a char that's 32-bit, but not part of string, etc.? ;)\n\nI get it, at a low level: char is a 32-bit value, capable of representing all (most?) unicode codepoints as a fixed-length binary value.  But it's not clear why they called that char, why there's no \"byte\" type, why string is essentially a vector of bytes, but already converted from bytes to unicode (rather than using stronger typing, and calling it char8, for example).  The low-level stuff is understandable, but the high-level design / reasoning, and how to use char along with all this... that stuff's not so clear.\n",

If I understand it, would this preserve the meaning and provide some more clarity?\n\n```\nFurthermore, the version of foo that accepts a &str argument can be seen as more flexible because it can be passed an &str or a String.  How is that possible?  A String has the .as_slice() trait, which presents it to the function as a string slice, so you can invoke foo(some_String.as_slice()) if it accepts an &str.\n```\n",
