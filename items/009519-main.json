  "body": "It is simply defined as `f64` across every platform right now.\n\nA use case hasn't been presented for a `float` type defined as the\nhighest precision floating point type implemented in hardware on the\nplatform. Performance-wise, using the smallest precision correct for the\nuse case greatly saves on cache space and allows for fitting more\nnumbers into SSE/AVX registers.\n\nIf there was a use case, this could be implemented as simply a type\nalias or a struct thanks to `#[cfg(...)]`.\n\nCloses #6592\n\nThe mailing list thread, for reference:\n\nhttps://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-July/004632.html\n",
