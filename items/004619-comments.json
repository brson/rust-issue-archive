    "body": "r+ overall, I trust you have a plan here. I'm confused about a number of elements and left a few line comments but don't let me slow you down. I'm fine with the multiplication of wonky allocators as stopgap measures; we're going to have a much more serious allocator -- or set of allocators -- at some point this year, this is all transitional.\n\nFor my own understanding: I realize bug #4457 uses the term \"without a runtime\", but to be precise: \"without a runtime\" is used here as an exact synonym for \"running in a thread that hasn't put a task pointer in TLS\", correct? There are enough moving pieces here that I think it pays to be precise in what we're talking about / doing.\n\n(The potential additional state of \"has a task pointer in TLS _but it's not accurate_ due to someone switching stacks without updating TLS\" is ... one of the reasons I'd like to move to pulling the task pointer out of `(sp & ~0xfff) + 0x1000`  or such)\n",

    "body": "@graydon Yes that is what I mean here by 'without a runtime'. Lately I think of 'the runtime' and 'the scheduler' as the same thing. This isn't going to get us to a true freestanding rust any time soon, but I think what people mostly want (and what we need) is to execute rust code without the scheduler. I hope to make it clear which parts of core rely on the scheduler and which don't.\n\nRegarding the issue of updating TLS, I don't yet understand the solution you are proposing and how it relates to our current implementation. Let's talk about it on IRC some time.\n",
