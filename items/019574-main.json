  "body": "(I don't understand why this works, and so I don't quite trust this yet. I'm pushing it up to see if anyone else can replicate this performance increase)\n\nSomehow llvm is able to optimize this version of Vec::reserve into dramatically faster than the old version. In micro-benchmarks this was 2-10 times faster. It also reduce my Rust compile time from 41 minutes to 27 minutes.\n\nCloses #19281.\n",
