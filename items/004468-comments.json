    "body": "This is harmless (the empty .so files just get used to track dependencies in the build system). But, I agree that the error messages you're seeing from ldconfig are confusing. We should fix this; @brson suggested using a meaningless extension for the empty files, so that we can still use them for dependencies but ldconfig won't complain about them.\n\nI'll change the title to reflect the proposed fix.\n",
