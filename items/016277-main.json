  "body": "- move some sidebar contents to a title bar when small\n- inline description toggle when small\n- make out-of-band and in-band content share space, rather than float and clash\n- compress wording of out-of-band content to avoid line-wrap as much as possible\n## [Live Version Here](http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~abeinges/doc/index.html)\n\nPages Of Interest:\n- [Vec](http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~abeinges/doc/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) (small path)\n- [TreeSet](http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~abeinges/doc/collections/treemap/struct.TreeSet.html) (long path)\n- [std](http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~abeinges/doc/std/index.html) (for stability dash)\n\nTBD in a future PR is to convert links in the sidebar into a series of nest ul/li's, so that they can easily be moved to a drop-down in the new title bar. I think this is out of scope for this PR, but am willing to implement it now if desired.\n",
