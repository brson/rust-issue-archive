    "body": "I bet `select()` needs a similar change. It will probably have to accumulate destructors for each pipe that it marks itself as blocked on. Or use `task::unkillable` (maybe also `task::rekillable` but probably not), and just one destructor to do all of the post-blocked work. I expect the latter will be a lot easier.\n",
