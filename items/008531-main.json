  "body": "...er\n\nI believe the calls to waitpid are interacting badly with the message passing that goes\non between schedulers and causing us to have very little parallelism in\nthe test suite. I don't fully understand the sequence of events that causes\nthe problem here but clearly blocking on waitpid is something that a\nwell-behaved task should not be doing.\n\nUnfortunately this adds quite a bit of overhead to each test: one thread, two\ntasks, three stacks, so there's a tradeoff. The time to execute run-pass on\nmy 4-core machine goes from ~750s to ~300s.\n\nThis should have a pretty good impact on cycle times.\n\ncc @toddaaro\n",
