It's not a security issue.\n\nIt's not a security issue for pure safe code but it may be needed to use an (unsafe) `fork` when Rust's runtime doesn't implement all required features (e.g. OS specific syscall like `clone(2)`).\nThis is why I think it should be useful to be able to centralize post-`fork` handlers to (manually) call after unsafe `fork`-like. Otherwise, there is no way (other than dig in all libraries code used) to known what should be done to cleanly re-initialize the process context.\n\nHowever, this manual solution doesn't address the problem of foreign code (binding) using `fork` (neither the developer ignoring this issue). The #9568 should.\n",

It's all in the `rand` library. As far as I can tell, nothing has changed and your argument that OsRng should be robust to forks should hold. Presumably, any security library would use that.\n",
