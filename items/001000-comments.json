    "body": "I don't know what the right solution for this is in general. In this case, #fmt is doing a pretty good job of identifying where the problem is, it just doesn't result in a very helpful error. Here `args[0]` ends up more or less being wrapped in `std::extfmt::conv_str(...)`, and we haven't declared that we're using crate std.\n\nFor this specific problem syntax extensions will probably need to declare which crates they depend on at runtime so the compiler can catch this.\n",
