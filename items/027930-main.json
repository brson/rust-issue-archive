  "body": "This PR rewrites the code that previously relied on `PATH_MAX`.\n\nOn my tests, even though the user gives the buffer length explicitly, both Linux's glibc and OS X's libc seems to obey the hard limit of `PATH_MAX` internally. So, to truly remove the limitation of `PATH_MAX`, the related system calls should be rewritten from scratch in Rust, which this PR does not try to do.\n\nHowever, eliminating the need of `PATH_MAX` is still a good idea for various reasons, such as: (1) they might change the implementation in the future, and (2) some platforms don't have a hard-coded `PATH_MAX`, such as GNU Hurd.\n\nMore details are in the commit messages.\n\nFixes #27454.\n\nr? @alexcrichton\n",
