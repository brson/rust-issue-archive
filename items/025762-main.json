  "body": "The current codegen tests only compare IR line counts between similar\nrust and C programs, the latter getting compiled with clang. That looked\nlike a good idea back then, but actually things like lifetime intrinsics\nmean that less IR isn't always better, so the metric isn't really\nhelpful.\n\nInstead, we can start doing tests that check specific aspects of the\ngenerated IR, like attributes or metadata. To do that, we can use LLVM's\nFileCheck tool which has a number of useful features for such tests.\n\nTo start off, I created some tests for a few things that were recently\nadded and/or broken.\n",
