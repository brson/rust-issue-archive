I was thinking that it could not be a macro if\nwe wanted it to appear in constant expressions. But I guess that's not\ntrue, since all the macro does is something like\n\n```\n&((T*)NULL)->f\n```\n\nwhich I believe is legal in our constant expressions -- or at least\nmight as well be legal in any world that permits `sizeof` in a\nconstant expression.\n\nIn that case, we don't need to reserve offsetof, except that it would\nmean you write `sizeof(T)` (or whatever) but `offsetof!(T,f)`. I guess\nthat's fine.\n",
