Whether this is something that the language should handle by magically using two meanings for 'ncurses' in the scope or not is a different issue. We're already doing something magical where we resolve 'import x::x' in the scope above the current scope (which was causing this error in the first place). This works in multi-module crates but not in single-mod files like this, since there is no outer scope to fall back to.\n",
