    "body": "Hi. This looks great!\n\nAs I believe this is your first contribution to Rust (huzzah!), we need to make sure the paperwork is in order (sigh). Fortunately it's really simple. If you already have level 1 committer access with Mozilla then you're good to go. Otherwise please submit a committer agreement[1], which is mostly just a legal paper trail asserting that you wrote the code.\n\nLet me know when you've done that and I will get this merged.\n\n[1] http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/notification/. Note that there's no need to request level 1 committer access for contributing to Rust - we just need the signed agreement.\n",
