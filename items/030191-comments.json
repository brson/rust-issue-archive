    "body": "So I've spent a bit of time poking at this, and ultimately the type parameter is being treated as ambiguously fulfilling the obligation here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e9ac440/src/librustc/middle/traits/select.rs#L560-L590\n\nWhile this example gets more interesting when you consider that the same code can be written as `where String: Into<T>`, which makes this even more obviously unambiguous, I think the example in the comment there is much easier to reason about. `impl<T: Eq> Eq for Vec<T>`. We are saying this is ambiguous, because when trying to evaluate whether `_: Eq`, we will eventually try to determine if `Vec<_>: Eq`, and recurse.\n\nHowever, this seems like it's actually easy to disambiguate. An impl can never overlap with itself. We can safely ignore that obligation. (I'm likely conflating the concepts of an obligation being fulfilled with traits overlapping. I'm not sure how separate those are meant to be in the compiler).\n\nAnyway, I'm fiddling with some changes to try and see if we can simply ignore the ambiguity when the candidate is where we started from, though I'd love to know if this sounds like it's on the right track.\n",

    "body": "@arielb1 Yes, it appears the specific example I gave is unsound, I was trying to get something that I could throw on playground. The problem still exists in cases that cannot be mucked up by sibling crates. Here's a simplified version of the actual case that I'm running into this, which I'm fairly certain could not be made ambiguous by sibling crates.\n\n``` rust\nuse std::error::Error\ntrait NativeSqlType;\nstruct Row;\n\npub trait FromSql<A: NativeSqlType>: Sized {\n    fn from_sql(bytes: Option<&[u8]>) -> Result<Self, Box<Error>>;\n}\n\npub trait FromSqlRow<A: NativeSqlType>: Sized {\n    fn build_from_row(row: &mut Row) -> Result<Self, Box<Error>>;\n}\n\nimpl<ST, T> FromSqlRow<ST> for T where\n    ST: NativeSqlType,\n    T: FromSql<ST>,\n{\n    fn build_from_row(row: &mut Row) -> Result<Self, Box<Error>> {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow in a separate crate, I am unable to write this impl:\n\n``` rust\nstruct User {\n    id: i32,\n    name: String,\n}\n\nimpl<ST> FromSqlRow<ST> for User where\n    ST: NativeSqlType,\n    (i32, String): FromSqlRow<ST>\n{\n    fn build_from_row(row: &mut Row) -> Result<Self, Box<Error>> {\n        let (id, name) = try!(<(i32, String) as FromSqlRow<ST>>::build_from_row(row));\n        Ok(User {\n            id: id,\n            name: name,\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe only way this can ever become ambiguous is for another crate to create a blanket impl for a trait it does not control (disallowed).\n",

It is true that downstream creates could, according to the orphan rules alone, define an overlapping impl like:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo;\nimpl<T> Into<T> for Foo { .. }\n```\n\nbut they would also be required to prove this impl is disjoint from the impls in the crate where `Into` is defined (this is the overlap check).\n\nIn other words, the crate that defines the trait has the ability to define blanket impls of that kind, since any other crate that might overlap would be able to detect the overlap easily enough.\n",

    "body": "> Shouldn't we be able to omit that assumption for binary projects, or for types which are not public? \n\nWe have not (currently) drawn any distinction between binary / library projects. I am reluctant to do so -- it seems to create refactoring hazards where you expose a binary as a library and so forth. But at the same time it seems clear that a number of coherence issues go away for binary projects -- so maybe there is a good way to handle these \"at most once\" decisions. \n\nRegarding privacy, that's another thing that coherence doesn't currently consider, but yes I could imagine taking it into account. \n",
