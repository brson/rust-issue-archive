Sorry for the delay on this PR, I was off grid for a while over the holidays. \n\nI hadn't commented yet since I wanted to check that Travis CI was passing first -- the build was failing less than a minute in for a while last night for some reason but it looks like that got resolved.\n\nI had chosen `fold_subitems_with` because I thought it made the semantics clearer, but I can see how `super_fold_with` better communicates the intended use and is more consistent.\n",
