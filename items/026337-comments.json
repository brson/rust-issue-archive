The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Yes, my original draft had hexidecimal, but we decided to remove it for now, because the target audience is people who have never seen any of this before. I've been paying attention to feedback so far, and have heard very little issues specifically.\n\nAlso, the other problem with using hex values is that they're _also_ wrong, because they don't actually go by individual byte, so the addresses are `0x0`, `0x4`, 0x8`, etc, and then they really should be going the other way too.... we decided all this complexity wasn't worth it.\n\nSo thank you, @RoPP , but for now, we can't accept this patch.\n",

    "body": "Ok maybe hexadecimal is too complex for real beginners.\n\nAnyway, there is still the problem that this notation is ambiguous. In the \"complex example\", it's pretty impossible to know what is an address and what is a value (except to scroll between the code and the table).\n\nMaybe a \"@\" could be add to the address (a note could be added for people who expected a hexadecimal value :) ).\n\nExample:\n\n| Address | Name | Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| @ 1 | i | @ 0 |\n| @ 0 | x | 1 |\n",
