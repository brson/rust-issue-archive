  "body": "After the library successfully called `fork(2)`, the child does several\nsetup works such as setting UID, GID and current directory before it\ncalls `exec(2)`.  When those setup works failed, the child exits but the\nparent didn't call `waitpid(2)` and left it as a zombie.\n\nThis patch also add several sanity checks.  They shouldn't make any\nnoticeable impact to runtime performance.\n\nThe new test case in `libstd/io/process.rs` calls the ps command to check\nif the new code can really reap a zombie.\nThe output of `ps -A -o pid,sid,command` should look like this:\n\n```\n  PID   SID COMMAND\n    1     1 /sbin/init\n    2     0 [kthreadd]\n    3     0 [ksoftirqd/0]\n...\n12562  9237 ./spawn-failure\n12563  9237 [spawn-failure] <defunct>\n12564  9237 [spawn-failure] <defunct>\n...\n12592  9237 [spawn-failure] <defunct>\n12593  9237 ps -A -o pid,sid,command\n12884 12884 /bin/zsh\n12922 12922 /bin/zsh\n...\n```\n\nwhere `./spawn-failure` is my test program which intentionally leaves many\nzombies.  Filtering the output with the \"SID\" (session ID) column is\na quick way to tell if a process (zombie) was spawned by my own test\nprogram.  Then the number of \"defunct\" lines is the number of zombie\nchildren.\n",
