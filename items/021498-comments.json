The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @huonw (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "I added some simple randomness to the directory name, and the test removes the directory when the test passes (to avoid accumulating a bunch of different directories when the test is run multiple times). The directory is not removed on failure, but I think that that might actually be helpful if the test fails. (Plus, I was feeling too lazy to implement a new RAII type to remove the directory on panic.)\n\nNote that `process-spawn-with-unicode-params` uses the same directory name every time as well, but it would need slightly more care. In that case the child asserts that it's running in a particular directory, so it needs to have access to the same path that the parent used.\n",

    "body": "@barosl: I believe that I can mostly explain this now.\n\nLooking more closely at `src/libstd/sys/windows/process.rs`, I find that if a program is found in the child's path, the child is called using the full absolute path (with extension). This is why the regression test failed.\n\nIf the program is not found in the child's path (either because an absolute path was used, or because it's just not there), we call `CreateProcessW` with whatever the user specified as the program. A relative path that is in the parent's path but not the child's path will therefore be preserved in the child `args`, while every other case will cause `args[0]` to be an absolute path.\n\nThe one thing that I don't get is why in your local path, the program is not being found in the child's path. This shouldn't vary by Windows version because `libstd` is doing the search, not Windows. But perhaps you are running into a `Path` bug or compatibility issue?\n",
