Some thoughts we had were:\n- The name is a little odd and there may perhaps be better alternatives. @sfackler notes that this is \"the memcpy\" but the name doesn't quite imply that.\n- The style of the API is somewhat unique and not always found everywhere else, so it may be good to ensure it's nice and principled as well.\n",

    "body": "I noticed that the [`rand::Rng`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/num/rand/trait.Rng.html) uses the word `fill` to refer to changing the value of every existing member of a slice. Also note that https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27744 is related to this in that it would make sense to have the function that replaces all the values in a collection with a slice's value to have a similar name to the function that appends the values of a slice to a collection. Note that there's already a function named `extend` that is a more general form of the function that appends a slice to a vector.\n\nSo, I propose that:\n- `clone_from_slice` be renamed to `fill_from_slice`.\n- `clone_from_value` (the new function I proposed in the discussion to replace `set_memory`) be named `fill`.\n- `push_all` be renamed `extend_from_slice`.\n",

    "body": "I identified some problems when trying to implement this:\n1. The name `fill_from_slice` implies that in `x.fill_from_slice(y)`, every element of `x` will be modified. However, the definition of `clone_from_slice` says that `clone_from_slice` only modifies the first N elements if `y` has N elements and N < `x.len()`. Thus, if the current semantics are intended to be carried forward, `fill_from_slice` is not a good name. However, I also feel like `clone_from_slice` is not a good name either, because it doesn't convey this idea that only the prefix will be modified.\n2. The return value is `usize` but it's not marked `#[must_use]`. This makes the non-obvious semantics described in #1 dangerous.\n3. `clone_from_slice` is part of the `SliceExt` trait. If it is renamed in the trait also, it would affect any other implementations of `SliceExt`. According to the code, `SliceExt` is being tracked in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27701. It seems it is possible to rename the slice method without renaming the trait method, but that would be weird.\n",

    "body": "I like the name `clone_from_slice` for the method `clone_from_slice(&mut self, src: &[T]) -> usize` as is.\n\nOn other naming suggestions:\n-  `fill_from_slice` and `fill_slice` - I don't like these because fill() generally means assigning multiple elements to a single value.  cf. C++'s [fill()](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill) algorithm, Java's [`Arrays.fill()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#fill%28int[],%20int%29), PHP's [`array_fill()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-fill.php).\n-  `clone_slice` - I don't like omitting \"from\" because I agree with @briansmith that it's ambiguous.  `a.clone_slice(b)` does not clearly indicate whether `a` or `b` is modified.\n-  `clone_from` - Potentially confused with `Clone::clone_from`.\n-  `copy_from_slice`, `assign_from_slice`, `set_from_slice`, `set_to_slice`, and `set_slice` - I don't like these because I think that it is better for the method to have the word \"clone\" in it so that people immediately know that `Clone` is involved.\n\nI agree with @briansmith that there is potential for this API to be used incorrectly.  If the destination slice has more elements than the source slice, then some elements of the destination slice will not be overwritten.  For example, imagine clone_from_slice() being used to erase a sensitive area of memory, but the source slice had fewer elements.  In that case, there would be `self.len() - src.len()` elements that would not be overwritten!\n\nI propose the following two changes:\n1. The method panics if the source slice has fewer elements.\n2. The method does not return a value (just like `Clone::clone_from`).\n",

Otherwise Slice wouldn't be allowed to implement `Clone` in the future (present?), which would be weird and bad.\n",

    "body": "Closing as this was intended to be closed by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30943\n\n@briansmith as @ubsan pointed out I think that rust-lang/rfcs#1419 will be useful for a guaranteed memcpy/memset\n\n@bluss we talked about this at the libs team triage yesterday and the conclusion was that we're a little wary about specializing for `T: Copy` to use memcpy for the reason that a `Clone` impl can diverge from the `Copy` one (because `Clone` is manually done). We may want to discuss this further, however, (as that divergence seems crazy), but here's probably not the right place to do so. One saving grace is that we could specialize for `T = u8` and some other primitives as that's likely what this is called with 99% of the time. That is likely also best discussed on a new issue or PR, however.\n\n@ubsan the `clone_from` method was avoided to not conflict with `Clone::clone_from` specifically, and we also can't impl `Clone` for `[T]` for the `Sized` reasons out outlined as well. If we can one day impl `Clone` for slices then we can perhaps just deprecate this method.\n",
