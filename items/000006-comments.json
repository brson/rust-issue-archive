    "body": "We just discussed this here in Toronto. The approach we settled on is:\n- `bind` will go, maybe to be restored later in the form of a macro\n- Function types will fall into three categories, `@fn`, `~fn` (both boxed), and plain `fn`, with the latter only being allowed as a function argument that's passed by alias.\n- `fn` values are noncopyable. Thus, you never have a raw `fn` value on your hand. Boxes of functions are copyable.\n- There will be `@fn(args...){body...}` and `~fn(){}` expressions to create boxed function values. They will close over their environment by copying the closed-over values into their environment.\n- Functions passed by alias to another function can be written as plain `fn(...){...}` expressions. These 'fully' close over their environment (the resulting alias holds the frame pointer). These must never outlive the function call they are passed to.\n- Function boxes can transparently be passed to a function that expects a function alias. (Or maybe require an explicit dereference with `*` if that causes ambiguities.)\n- As a form of syntactic sugar, a function that takes a function alias as its last argument can be called like `f(args) { block }`, causing the given block to become a function. If this function needs to take arguments, it becomes `f(args) { |arg1, arg2| ...}` (this syntax is not set in stone).\n- Function values take the form of a single-word code pointer followed by an environment (of any size). `@fn` and `~fn` create a box of the right size and copy in the code pointer and closed-over values. Stack-allocated functions that are passed by alias have their code pointer plus a frame pointer allocated on-stack, and the address of the code pointer passed.\n\nThe issue of returning/breaking out of blocks has not been addressed yet, I'll try to bring that up later.\n",

    "body": "You misunderstand my question. Finding the free variables certainly shouldn't be done at parse time. I mean, figuring out which \"flavor\" of capture a function has (because the current plan seems to be to have three: no capture, copying capture, aliasing capture). Which it is depends on what context the lambda occurs in (if it is being put in a box it should capture the environment by copying it; if it is being passed by as a function argument then it's by alias). So I'm wondering when the best time to decide on that is.\n",
