This forces Rust programs to either ship the UCRT Redistributable or to depend on a Windows update. The VC14 toolchain can compile C code against this as well, which must then ship the VCRuntime redistributable.\r\n- take the `memcpy`/etc assembly from an open-source C library like MinGW (or ask MS to open-source the UCRT), and compile that into Rust programs.
