  "body": "There were a bunch of problems with consts where an enum was contained within some other type (vector, tuple, struct, etc.); some of these would cause LLVM assertion failures, and some would silently read from the wrong address.  These changes should fix all of that.\n\nIt would be good if someone with access to a win32 host could do the equivalent of `make check-stageN-rpass TESTNAME=enum` on that platform before merging this.\n",
