Happy to do it if it would get merged)\n- Is marking this stable OK? It seems pretty minor\n- More subjectively, this seemed to be right on the cusp of worth macro-ifying. I suspect that it's actually worth doing this for all of [u8], [u16] and friends, so I presume that I should actually macro it?\n",
