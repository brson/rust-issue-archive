This ties in with some discussions that @pnkfelix and I were having regarding tracing GC: In particular, if you have smart pointers like `Rc`, you would like them to be traced for any kind of tracing GC -- but that means traversing `*` pointers, which is not necessarily a safe thing to do. However, if we had some other kind of pointer, perhaps itself a smart pointer (actually a lang item), that basically indicated a wrapper pointer, then we could know that we ought to trace the pointer, and also know to treat it properly in the kind computation.\n\nThis argues for replacing `*` with `Raw<T>`, as has been proposed, since it would make it cleaner to have a family of raw pointers for different purposes.\n",
