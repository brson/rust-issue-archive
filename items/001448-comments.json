    "body": "Actually using the example given, and the latest Rust compiler (0.10), the problem is closer to #1387.\n\nFor an example of this bug try:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    #macro[[#apply[f, [x, ...]], f(x, ...)]];\n    fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int { ret a + b; }\n    assert (#apply[add, [y, 15]] == 16);\n}\n```\n\nHere I know exactly what is going on, the span used is the one for the location of the pattern variable `x` and not the location of `y`.  Change that too `#apply[add, [(1 + y), 15]]` and the correct location will be reported.  The problem is the AST node for `y` has two locations associated with it and nether one is necessary the correct choice.  What is really needed is a backtrace of sorts so that both locations will be reported, much like is done for C++ templates.\n\nFailing a full backtrace I think the better location is the one for the location of `y`, I can try to fix that if its important enough, but like I said it will do nothing towards fixing the example given.\n",
