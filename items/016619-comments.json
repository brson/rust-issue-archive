Some thoughts:\n- Maybe show only `(pass --explain E0001 to see more detail)`, and have `--explain` provide the extended discussion URL message?

This would seem desirable to avoid maintaining multiple similar documents, and avoid drift/rot.\n- Do we want all error help pages to be loose static pages, or do we want the markdown to be parsed and embedded inside a general template like libs?\n- Do we want the errors to be indexed and serachable in the same way as libs?\n",

    "body": "This is exciting! :smiley: I love how extensive Rust\u2019s documentation is getting now. I do share the concerns about long error messages, though.\n\nMaybe this could be separated into a note-like message, similar to the `note: expansion site` message that appears when an error occurs in a macro expansion? To make it stand out more, perhaps it could be changed to a different colour as well. (Notes are green, warnings are yellow, and errors are red, so maybe this could be a cyan \u2018help\u2019\u00a0message or something?) Combining this with @vks\u2019s and @Gankro\u2019s suggestion of moving the URL to the `--explain` description, the error looks like this:\n\n```\nhello.rs:4:9: 4:10 error: unreachable pattern [E0001]\nhello.rs:4         7       => (),\n                   ^\nhelp: pass `--explain E0001` to see more detail\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nwhich is quite a lot shorter (horizontally) than what we have now, even without this change. The help message would also stand out if it were a different colour, hopefully drawing people\u2019s attention to it.\n\nRegarding duplication of explanations, I think this could be handled later. I\u2019d like it if the `--explain` description were automatically spliced into the online \u2018Summary\u2019 section, but that makes rendering these docs quite complex\u2026\n",

This reduces clutter in the compiler output, and provides a nice simple > moderate > advanced progression of the documentation.\n\nThere's tension here: better error output is better for newbies, and more terse output is better for more experienced people or, as @richo mentioned, parsing output. I'm not sure where the right mixture is here.\n\n@huonw you're right about the CSS.\n\nOne thing with not matching up the explain text: it allows for a 'short' and 'long' form explanation. Maybe the right answer _is_ to put the URL at the bottom of each explain text, leave the explain in the register call for now, like it is, and leave the extended explanation as the page.\n\n> I idly wonder if it's worth supporting nested directories for formatting the doc pages,\n\nIs this because of a lack of inodes or something?\n\n> Do we want all error help pages to be loose static pages, or do we want the markdown to be parsed and embedded inside a general template like libs?\n\nIt's already embedded inside of the general template, though I'd imagine that eventually, we'd want to change the template around a tiny bit. Unsure.\n\nI really like @P1start 's `help:` idea, though I have no idea how to implement it.\n",

    "body": "Technically, being brief isn't a huge problem because people often paste weird error messages into Google. Don't know that `error C1245` is from visual studio? Search `VS error C1245` and you'll usually find a good help page if it's a compiler error.\n\nVerbosity may also be a GUI issue. Visual studio (the older version I used...maybe not the new one) pastes compiler output verbatim. Qt Creator has a second mode which collects the brief _descriptions_ together and only shows the expanded output when you click on the item to expand it. GUIs are probably outside the scope of this bug though.\n",

    "body": "Digging through how this stuff is set up now. All the diagnostic messages are defined in a single file as raw strings in `src/librustc/diagnostis.rs`. They're registered with some family of macros, which are themselves full-on plugins(!).\n\nThat doesn't strike me as a particularly scalable solution if each one of these is going to be a huge discussion of the error. However I'm not sure if there's a technical reason for this, or if this was just convenient/reasonable at the time. Not sure why this had to be done as a macro/plugin either.\n\nA saner alternative might be to just provide the _path_ to the error md, and have them parsed in as plain text, with the `#Summary` header stripped and everything after the next header (`\\n#` I guess?) excluded. However I'm not clear as to what can or can't be done in librustc's code, especially if things need to be available at early stages of compilation.\n\nHowever, with this design librustc and librustdoc don't really need to know about each other, they just both know about these docs. Librustc does gain a _minor_ understanding of markdown (in that it knows #'s at starts of lines are important), and the first section of the docs will have to be _fairly_ more well-formed than other doc pages, but not by much.\n",
