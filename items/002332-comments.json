    "body": "I think this inference failure is actually legitimate.  The problem is the type declaration `type chan<T> = T`, which is pretty meaningless.  So, in effect, you wind up with an expected type for the closure of `fn~(T)`, which means that when we go to invoke the method, sure enough, we know nothing about what `po` is expected to be (it's T!).\n\nIf you change `type chan<T> = T` to `enum chan<T> = uint` or some such, it works fine.\n",
