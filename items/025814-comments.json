    "body": "I just did a quick local test to confirm my assumption that generating a revocation cert is doesn't change the key itself:\n- generate test key\n- export test key into `before_cert` file\n- generate revocation cert for test key\n- export test key into `after_cert` file\n- diff `before_cert` against `after_cert`, and they were identical\n\nAnyone who holds the private key can generate a revocation cert, stating a reason and adding an optional description. We then store the revocation cert somewhere safe until we want to revoke the key, when we use it with `gpg --import revocation_cert_filename` and then use `gpg --send-keys` to push the revoked key to the keyservers and deactivate it (as described [here](http://www.hackdiary.com/2004/01/18/revoking-a-gpg-key/)). \n\nThis means we won't need to republish the public key or anything.\n\nIf everyone who holds a copy of the private key generates their own revocation cert, we'd know exactly who revoked the key if anyone ever did, but I'm not sure if this is information we'll ever want. \n\nIn the long term, it would be better to have each person who needs to use the key actually hold a [subkey](https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys) of the signing key, and keep the actual master key Super Secret (TM).\n",
