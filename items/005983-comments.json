Places where `||` could be useful:\n- traits that act like fns (my `thunk!` macro would have required `||` to be inferable to a bare fn)\n- \"contextless\" callbacks, which are good because they can be sent freely between tasks and are POD etc\n- writing little callbacks to hand off to C\n\nShouldn't be too hard to make this infer properly, rather than based on the expected type, if there were a moment to spare on such trivialities.\n\nAnyway, this feels like it's not a 1.0 thing, improving inference can only make more code work etc etc. It can't do any worse than it does today.\n",
