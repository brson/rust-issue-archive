    "body": "@SDX2000: Thanks for this! This would be probably more appropriate as a comment on the current [collections reform RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/509), so I'm going to close this and redirect you to comment there. Generally speaking though, we already have a function [concat](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/trait.SliceConcatExt.html#tymethod.concat), so we do have some desire to not use the same name for different things. Instead, a better solution might be if we end up growing an `AddAssign` trait that we could instead write:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut v = String::new();\nv += 'a';\nv += \"foo\";\n\nlet mut v = Vec::new();\nv += 1u8;\nv += [2u8, 3, 4];\n```\n\nAnd not worry about the method. There is a chance we might be able to get this in for rust 1.0 if someone does the work :)\n",
