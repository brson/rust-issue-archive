But more importantly, the fact that it uses only one field is because it is not yet complete: in order to be RFC compliant it should raise an error when it sees no newline in a config that requires the presence of newlines.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the review, @alexcrichton.\n\nI agree that having a mandatory `Config` parameter in `from_base64` is not very good usability-wise. But at least it mirrors the fact that `to_base64` requires the same parameter, applying the priciple of least surprise.\n\nTalking of API in other design, I would like this method to work like `Fixnum#to_s` in Ruby. When called without any argument, `to_s` will produce a string \"as expected\"\n\n```\n42.to_s # => \"42\"\n```\n\nIf one wants to convert that number to a string, but using another base, they can add the `base` parameter to it.\n\n```\n42.to_s(base=16) # => \"2a\"\n```\n\nThis kind of API requires the possibility to have default parameters, something that Rust does not have at the moment IIUC.\n\nTwo concrete possibility for the API of `from/to_base64` may be\n1. a generic method `to_base64_with_config(&self, config: Config)` and a shortcut for the most common case `to_base64(&self) {self.to_base64(STANDARD) }`.\n2. same as 1. plus separate methods for each encoding config, e.g., `to_base64_url`, `to_base64_xmlnames`.\n\nI think this is the best kind of API as long as default parameters cannot be used.\n\nShould I go forth and implement one of these designs?\n",

    "body": "Sorry for being a little slow to getting back to you! It looks like the trend of other languages is to either have a separate encoder/decoder for each type of base64 encoding (a separate trait for us) or a separate pair of methods.\n\nI personally find the `from_base64` method confusing as I always forget what the \"from\" part refers to. I would tend to want to rename this encode/decode as it's clear that the receiver of the method is being encoded or it's being decoded (as opposed to \"from\" referring to the return value). I'm sure that @aturon would know about other conventions in the standard library as well. The `ToHex`/`FromHex` traits would also need to be affected.\n\nSo I suppose to speak concretely, I would advocate for something like:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Base64Decode {\n    fn decode_base64(...);\n    fn decode_base64_url(...);\n    fn decode_base64_xml(...);\n}\n```\n\nOr something along the lines of that.\n\nThis should get another opinion though as I'm sure others would differ!\n",

    "body": "The use of `from_` here does not follow [the usual conventions](http://aturon.github.io/style/naming/README.html), which use `from_` only for constructors. Given that these methods are used as part of serialization, I think `encode` and `decode` are a good pairing (rather than trying to shoehorn the conversion method conventions).\n\nAs far as `Config` goes, the Java API uses something a bit like a builder strategy -- there are [three entry points](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Base64.html) to get an encoder (vanilla, MIME, and url), but then the [encoder itself](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Base64.Encoder.html) has a builder-style method for setting the padding. We've been [exploring the builder pattern](http://aturon.github.io/ownership/builders.html) in Rust, and it might be worth considering something similar here.\n\nIn any case, I agree with @sfackler that the decoding methods shouldn't take a `Config` structure unless _all_ of the fields are relevant, and with @alexcrichton that we should have an ergonomic default. I'd personally be happy with a builder-style interface, or with convenience method(s) that wrap a more general method that take `DecodeConfig` or some such.\n",

    "body": "I see the Builder patter overcomplex for a Base64 transformation, especially because it would force the addition of one method for each supported type from which you can encode/decode. And BTW, the Java API is not exactly a model to follow for ergonomic interfaces. :)\n\nHere is my proposal, based on what @alexcrichton suggested: a `Base64{En,De}code` trait for the basic {en,de}coding and other traits for specialized conversions. I propose this split to avoid having big `Base64{En,De}code` traits that:\n1. force all implementing types to implement many different functions,\n2. require breaking the trait to add new configurations.\n\n```\ntrait Base64Decode {\n    fn decode_base64(...);\n    fn decode_base64_with_config(...);\n}\n\ntrait Base64DecodeXML {\n    fn decode_base64_xml_name(...);\n    fn decode_base64_xml_nmtoken(...);\n}\n\ntrait Base64DecodeURL { ... }\n```\n",
