    "body": "Afaik this is intended behaviour. The problem here are the uniqueness rules. In principle a user could implement both `Fn(A1, A2) -> T` and `Fn(A1) -> T` for the same type. Then it would not be clear, how a method call to `run_self` on such a type should be resolved.\n\nThere are workarounds though. You could simply go back to boxing the closure as a trait object or you could wrap the closures in a newtype if you want to avoid the vtable dispatch.\n\nIn this context rust-lang/rfcs#493 is probably of interest as it has a more detailed discussion of how one could allow this kind of thing.\n",
