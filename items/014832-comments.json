    "body": "Up front: I haven't looked at the patch.\n\nFrom the bug description, it sounds like @alexcrichton is conflating the consequences of changing the defaults of whether `rustc` itself has an `RPATH` setting with the consequences of changing the defaults for whether `rustc` auto-injects an `RPATH` into the binaries it compiles without prompting from the end-user.\n\nThat is, the former seems to related to whether you can run `$target/stageN/bin/rustc` out of the box, and the latter relates to how you would go about running rustc-generated binaries (such as `rustdoc`) out of the box.\n\nI suppose it is natural to conflate these things, since `rustc` is indeed itself a product of `rustc`.  But nonetheless, we _could_ deviate from the chosen default for the `rustc` binary itself (and only `rustc` itself).  It's just a thought; maybe we are better off not doing that though, to ensure that users who attempt to use `rust` encounter this pain point as soon as they possibly can...\n",
