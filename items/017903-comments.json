    "body": "Ah, I had not thought of that.  If absolute uniformity is the goal, I suppose that would be the way to go.  I assumed the goal was, well, good style: easy-to-read, easy-to-write, elegant code.  \n\nI'll be honest: it's mostly a taste thing.  Any variation of the range comment looks, to me, easier to read, write and just more elegant than a block of triple slashes.  As mentioned, most every other language that _could_ prefer line comments chooses not to -- maybe there's a reason?  Rust is about practicality and efficiency; a systems programming language, where less is more, perhaps a nod to the days where every byte counted.  The line comments shout \"unconsidered waste.\"  Upon first seeing it, the optimizer in me thought \"I reeeeely hope there's better way to do that.\"  It detracted from me learning Rust.  I stopped reading and reached for the language reference hoping Rust was not actually that tedious.  Plus, am I the only one for whom it evokes the ASCII-art [crack-tro scene .NFO](http://www.defacto2.net/file/detail/b13fe3) files of yore?  It just seems a little gauche by association. \n\nBy inefficiency, I mean it's O(N) characters to comment N lines, where O(1) will do.    Yes, your editor can do it for you, but just because it can generate reams of filler does not mean it should; and not everyone's editor supports Rust (yet!).  In the case of documentation, you may be writing Rust \"code\" in the context of a Markdown or other file where Rust-specific assists are not available.  (Incidentally, Pandoc does not seem to render triple-slash blocks correctly in the Guide.)\n\nPersonally I feel that much waste is distasteful enough that it will drive people to use range comments, and you will have even more divergence from the style guide than a space here or there.  A new language doesn't have to follow the prevailing style -- in fact, the style guide might be a great place to change it.\n\nAnyway, these aren't my ideas.  From [Code Complete](http://cc2e.com/), Chapter 32:\n\n> Use styles that don't break down or discourage modification. Any style that's too fancy is annoying to \n> maintain.\n> ...\n> For longer comments, the task of creating long columns of double slashes, manually breaking lines of text between rows, and similar activities is not very rewarding, and so the /\\* \u2026 */ syntax is more appropriate for multiline comments.\n",
