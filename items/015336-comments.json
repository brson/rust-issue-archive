Making things plugins that can be plugins is probably a reasonable technique though, so I _think_ we should keep it as is. @kmcallister, opinions?\n- It uses local data.\n- The fine-grained error groups.

With the organization you've laid out here one can put error code definitions near their use, but that doesn't mean every module's errors need to be namespaced (i.e. even if we put diagnostics defs in many places they can all be called \"E####\").\n\nStill though, I tend to think putting the defs in one place will make their maintenance easier. I hope this information can be filled in by casual and newbie developers, and having to look all over the compiler for the right place to document an error seems more difficult than opening up the one canonical diagnostics file.\n",
