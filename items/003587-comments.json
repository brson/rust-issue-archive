    "body": "It's a fair amount of code but it's [here](https://github.com/jesse99/gnos) and [here](https://github.com/jesse99/rwebserve). You can in theory build it and run it (use make run-db), but there are quite a few dependencies. However they should all be in cargo (except you need my forks of rust-mustache and rust-socket). If you do that then you should be able to repro the CPU spiking by clicking on the big discs in the browser window it spawns (rub-db isn't perfectly reliable because it kicks off a browser page and then starts the server: sometimes chrome gives up too quickly).\n\ngnos commit 89f2d70b553d170b9d1ac5c10a8cefe336118c9e and rwebserve commit 49cabbf56bc34f9b9acfcc6da0c0c70b4292eba8 are the bad ones. I'm going to try and remove some calls to spawn_sched that aren't doing what I thought.\n",
