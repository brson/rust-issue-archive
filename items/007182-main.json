  "body": "This is another big refactoring of `trans` though this is unlikely to have much of an\nimpact on code size or speed.\n\nThe major change here is the implementation of a `Type` struct which is the new\nhome for all your LLVM `TypeRef` needs. It's a simple wrapper struct, with static\nmethods for constructing types, then regular methods for\nmanipulating/interrogating them. The purpose of this is mostly to make the code\nsurrounding them somewhat more ideomatic. A line like: `T_ptr(T_ptr(T_i8()))` is \nnow `Type::i8().ptr_to().ptr_to()`,which is much more like regular Rust code.\n\nThere are a variety of smaller changes here and there:\n- Remove address spaces. At least it doesn't generate them, I haven't spent much\n  time looking for related code.\n- Use a macro for declaring the LLVM intrinsics, makes it look much nicer.\n- Make the type for a string slice actually create a named `str_slice` type in LLVM,\n  this makes reading the appropriate code much easier.\n- Change the way struct and enum type names are generated. This just means\n  that a struct like `struct Foo { a: int }` now produces the IR \n  `%struct.Foo = type { i64 }`, which is much easier to read. Similarly, other structs\n  are a bit tighter to make it easier to read.\n\n---\n\nThis PR did get away from me a little, as I occasionally got distracted or as I fixed\nup problems with unrelated code that were stopping me from continuing. One major\nthing is that this PR contains the work from #7168, since that would have conflicted\nwith this and it was broken anyway. Sorry for bundling it like this.\n\nFixes #3670 and #7063\n\n---\n\nEDIT: This no longer removes the llvm insn stats.\n",
