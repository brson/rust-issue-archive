  "body": "This is an almost-done draft of a guide on crates and modules. This is a hard guide to get right, I had to remove a chunk of the Guide because it was confusing.\n\nI've also pushed up https://github.com/steveklabnik/phrases which has matching code. Whenever we finish this guide, I think it'd be good to have a sample crate like this in the rust-lang org for people to compare against. The hardest part of a guide like this is that it depends on multiple files being correct, and being able to point to a repository would be very helpful.\n\nThings yet to do:\n1. external crates via cargo\n2. documentation\n\nI'm super open to still revising this if it's still confusing. There's been a lot of Reddit discussion about the module system, and I tried to incorporate those posts and the comments into this.\n",
