There is no user code in these functions except for struct and field names, and shadowing those doesn't seem to break things: http://is.gd/5KyXSL [expanded](https://gist.github.com/durka/50a5eac42af55cae6ebe) (though it does cause `non_shorthand_field_patterns` warnings)\n\nFor the type parameters unfortunately there is a risk of collision: http://is.gd/QYdfx5 [expanded](https://gist.github.com/durka/be972fef41475eaedbe7)\nHowever, it seems to me we could be doing better here: we could actually scan the list of type parameters and make a new one that can't collide.\n\nThoughts?\n",
