But libcore is, like the compiler itself, a pretty challenging test case! So for a \"break the whole compiler and put it together again\" (I'm exaggerating somewhat) change like this, you want to find test cases that don't depend on any libraries, not even core -- or just write one, all you need is a function that returns an immediate value like an int -- and compile them with the stage1 compiler (which exists, even though the step after it, building libcore with the stage1 compiler, failed) and see what happens.\n\nHopefully that's a little clearer...\n",
