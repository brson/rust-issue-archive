    "body": "Blech, it looks like I really messed up in my implementation, with this and the whole banana bug. Thanks for tracking this down - I think your guess is correct and that resetting the memory to 0 is the correct behavior, as we are moving to a place we know nothing about, so should be in a state identical to when we started.\n\nYou are correct that the byteset was not in the original algorithm. The idea behind it (which my benchmarks confirmed) was that especially when searching for small needles, there are many characters in the haystack that simply are not contained in the needle. For example, when searching code for some alphanumeric identifier, we will often run into spaces and brackets.\n\nTo utilize this, we build a very simple bitset of the characters in the needle. Then, when searching, if we find a character that is not in the needle (as confirmed by this bitset), we can jump forward by the whole length of the needle.\n",
