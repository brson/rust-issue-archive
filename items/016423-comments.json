    "body": "It is unclear to me what you expect the precise behavior of `set` to be. Is it simply a wrapper around set_grow with Default::default() supplied as the padding? Or is it just for setting values within the current bounds of the Vec?\n\nIf it's the former, then I'm reluctant only because its behaviour might be surprising (oops, `set`ing OOB just grew the array and padded it with some stuff?), whereas the curious signature/name of set_grow makes you stop and consider what it does.\n\nIf the latter, then you can `set` with `get_mut`, so the functionality is totally there, but just a bit obscured. I believe the current design of Vec is more or less that most of the provided mutation methods are for operations that _change the length_. Otherwise, it is preferred to provide the method on [slice](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/primitive.slice.html) and have the user .as_slice() the Vec. E.G. `swap` doesn't change the length, so it's on slice.\n",
