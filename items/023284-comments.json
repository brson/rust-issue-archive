    "body": "`Path::relative_from` made more sense back when we auto-normalized paths. The idea was if you joined the result to the first path, you'd get the second path. Since we don't normalize like that anymore, that behavior doesn't work.\n\nIt's still a potentially useful operation, but because of symlinks, there are two different behaviors that might be desired:\n1. The current behavior where joining the result onto the first path unambiguously refers to the same thing the second path does, even if there's symlinks (which basically means `base` needs to be a prefix of `self`)\n2. The old behavior where the result can start with `../` components. Symlinks mean traversing the `base path and then traversing the returned relative path may not put you in the same directory that traversing the`self` path does. But this operation is useful when either you're working with a path-based system that doesn't care about symlinks, or you've already resolved symlinks in the paths you're working with.\n\nBased on that I think it's reasonable to provide both implementations. The former might want to be called something like `strip_prefix()` instead. the latter could continue to be called `relative_from`.\n",
