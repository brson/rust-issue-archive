    "body": "There have been no plans for it, though nobody has yet voiced any opposition. I've been thinking about this issue for a long time, and it basically boils down to a request for default arguments. I suppose it would look something like:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo(bar: int, qux=2: int, ham=0: uint) { ... }\n```\n\nWhich could then be called as `foo(1)`, `foo(1, 3)`, `foo(1, ham=4)`, `foo(6, 7, 8)`, etc.\n\nEDIT: Please see huonw's proposed syntax below, which looks much better and more uniform with the current declaration syntax.\n",

(Also, presumably there should be a check that default args only appear at the end; and I guess there'll need to be something in the type-checker `rustc::middle::typeck`, and in `trans` too.)\n",

    "body": "@Seldaek I agree that if we want default arguments, then it's important to implement them before we commit to stdlib backwards-compatibility. However, I know of at least one language (Go) that philosophically rejects default arguments in favor of the functions-with-slightly-different-names-and-signatures approach.\n\nHowever, unlike Rust, Go has a few features that make the absence of default arguments less painful. For one, they have variadic functions.[1] Secondly, you are allowed to omit fields when creating structs, which means that it's easy to pass a configuration struct to a function (the omitted fields appear to be set to compiler-specified(?) default values, rather than being something a user can customize).[2]\n\nFor the former, we might be able to get away with macro-hackery to accomplish the same result (though at laborious implementation cost). Indeed, the forthcoming replacement for `fmt!()` does this:\n\n``` rust\nifmt!(\"{foo} {1} {bar} {0}\", 0, 1, foo=2, bar=3)\n```\n\nThis is code that works today.\n\nAs for the latter, the best analogue that we have would be to use functional struct update as per the following:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo { x: int, y: int, z: int }\n\nimpl Foo {\n    fn default() -> Foo {\n        Foo{x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}\n    }\n}\n\nfn bar(f: Foo) {\n    printf!(f);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    bar(Foo{y: 5, ..Foo::default()});\n}\n```\n\nI've seen this method offhandedly suggested in the past as a workaround for the lack of default arguments, but it's quite ungainly in practice (compare `bar(Foo{y: 5, ..Foo::default()})` to `bar(y=5)`, or my more conservative proposal of `bar(_, 5, _)`), and of course it forces all callers to create a struct even if they _do_ want to pass all the arguments.\n\nTo reiterate, as one who comes from Python and Javascript I'd obviously welcome default arguments. However, I do somewhat empathize with Go's philosophy of making APIs explicit (in exchange for (potentially greatly) inflating the number of functions in the API itself).\n\n[1] https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/NWMReL1HueQ/X9mdYduCOB8J\n\n[2] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2032149/optional-parameters\n",

    "body": "@bstrie thanks for the overview of Go. I agree with the point that overloading is probably a bad idea because it creates confusing APIs. Similarly the \"overloaded\" methods of jQuery that can take a callback in pretty much any argument you want are very weird and a pain to implement.\n\nAnd I sort of agree that wrapper functions to fill in default args are not so bad in some cases. But the problem is while it saves you from some confusing cases, it does introduce a lot of boilerplate in others. One example is `*::to_str_radix(num, radix)`. If we had optional args this could well be folded in `*::to_str(num, radix = 10)`. I feel that in some cases the explosion of function variants really makes things less intuitive and harder to remember. Just my two cents though obviously.\n",

    "body": "@pnkfelix Remember that the `Foo` struct in that example would probably have a much more self-descriptive name, and even with your proposed sugar would look something like this in practice:\n\n``` rust\nhtml::start_server(html::ServerOpts{port: 10088, *});\n```\n\nIt does look slightly nicer. Still not certain if it helps enough to warrant new syntax, or if it suffices to satisfy all use cases of default arguments.\n\nIn fact, to use my own example, when initializing something with a lot of options such as an HTML server I'd probably be just as happy setting up a `server_opts` struct beforehand and then just calling `start_server(server_opts)`. And I really don't mind adding a line with `..html::ServerOpts::default` if my struct initialization already spans several lines.\n\nI think perhaps we need to rethink where default arguments would be most useful. For me, it's not where there's a lot of potential arguments; these should be fairly rare, and a few lines to init a configuration struct is fine. Rather, I most miss default arguments when 1) the operation is fairly common, and 2) the operation has, at most, one or two arguments that are almost always superfluous but required for completeness. For example:\n\n``` rust\nlet foo = Some('a');\nfoo.unwrap();  // same as today\nfoo.unwrap('z');  // imagine that this replaced unwrap_or_default\n\nint::from_str(\"4\");  // same as today\nint::from_str(\"4\", 16);  // imagine that this replaced from_str_radix\n```\n\nHowever, now that I've typed these out, I actually prefer the explicitness of the separate methods. :) Maybe I don't really know what I want after all!\n\n@dobkeratops, from your experience with C++, can you give us some examples of nice C++ APIs that are enabled by default arguments?\n",

Optional arguments of type T without a default value are implicitly converted to T option and the function must check if a value was provided.

All optional arguments must have labels (they must be keyword arguments in order to be optional).

    "body": "Good to see more people commenting in favour :) Another reason I wanted it was to increase the amount of C++ APIs that could be translated seamlessly. Using C++ libraries is one big reason why we're stuck with C++.\n\nI suspect the only way we'd get this if the community could _implement it_ without any cost to the core developers. \nI agree they've got way more important things to do, & enums recover lost polymorphism with possibilities not immediately apparent to C++ conditioned brains.\n\nThis is why i wanted to submit the groundwork on parsing it into the AST data-structure. It would be ready for someone else to pick it up and try to get a solution. initial feedback discouraged me from making a PR.\n\nfrom c++ I look at what scala and python have on this with envy. A native non-GC language with that elegance would be great.\n..its more functionality in one place, less navigating to figure out what's going on, less nesting depth, less noise in the sourcecode. Not just trivially less typing. \nmaybe you could even claim its more self-documenting, the function signature tells you more about how its used.\n\nthe difficult bit is the type checker, preventing subtle bug possibilities and confusing errors if it was just done as a parser hack, it think.\n\nimagine if you could just write things like this..\n\n```\nfn substr(a:&str, start:int, end:int=a.len())->~str\n```\n\njust hack that sort of thing into the AST without error checks, i'm sure a lot can go wrong .. but imagine if we could fix that to do what was expected :)\n",

    "body": "I like the behavior that @tautologico describes in his comment.\n\nApplied to Rust, I believe this would translate to the following:\n\n``` rust\nfn ga(bu: int, zo: Option<int>, meu: Option<int>) {\n  let zo = zo.get_or_default(42);\n  let meu = meu.get_or_default(99);\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd these would all be valid calls :\n\n``` rust\nga(10, 20, 30); // 20 and 30 are automagically\n                // converted to Some(20) and Some(30)\nga(10, 20);         // ga(10, 20, 99) \nga(10);             // ga(10, 42, 99)\nga(10, None, None); // ga(10, 42, 99)\nga(10, 20, None);   // ga(10, 20, 99)\nga(10, None, 30);   // ga(10, 42, 30)\n```\n\nThe rule is that the trailing `Option<T>` parameters can be omitted. Here, the `Option` type is reused, but if this cause some problems another more specific `OptParam` type could be created.\n\nThis proposal allows the caller to choose precisely the parameters he wants to provide and the ones he wants to keep defaulted, independently of its position. Also, I think it's a good thing that the default value does not appear in the parameter list. This way, the default value is not limited to a constant expression, it can depend on the state of the object, or it can depend on other parameters.\n\nReal life example of a function that shows a GUI dialog box :\n\n``` rust\nfn showDialog(message: ~str,\n              parent: Option<Widget>,\n              title: Option<~str>,\n              type: Option<DialogType>,\n              icon: Option<Icon>) { ... }\n\n// Display an info box in the middle of the screen.\n// Set the title to \"information\", translated in the current locale\n// Set the icon to an \"info\" icon\nshowDialog(~\"hello, world!\");\n\n// Display a warning box in the middle of the screen.\n// Set the title to \"warning\", translated in the current locale\n// Set the icon to a \"warning\" icon\nshowDialog(~\"sick, sad world!\", None, None, WarningDialog);\n\n// Display a warning box in the middle of the screen.\n// Set the title to \"warning\", translated in the current locale\n// Set the icon to a custom icon\nshowDialog(~\"sick, sad world!\", None, None, WarningDialog, bugIcon);\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- the default value of `parent` is `None` (no parent)\n- the default value of `type` is `InfoDialog`\n- the default value of `icon` depends on the value of `type`\n- the default value of `title` depends on the value of `type` and on the current locale\n",

One is simpler to implement , with less choices to make in the syntax;\nso it makes sense for us to as for that, or to try to implement that first, as a stepping stone...\n\nHow is ommitting values that are defaulted any more cryptic than normal function calls? C++ programmers are used to sorting parameters for thsi already.  Usually some sort of control-flags word wth a sensible default at the end.. just omit the value instead of writing (..,BLAH_DEFAULT) whatever.. clarifies by only listing significant information.  People who need Rust are likely to have dealt with C++ already and hence be used to it.\n",

    "body": "I realized earlier today that [my proposal above](#issuecomment-22579034) (which tried to leverage existing struct-extension syntax to provide something close to default arguments, as I view structs as already providing the ingredients for keyword arguments), ignored one important issue: the syntax I was proposing assumed that one would be able to provide a default for _every_ argument (and then they would all be lifted into the single struct parameter).\n\nThis is of course not true in general: One quite often has some arguments that are required and others that are optional.\n\nI would still like to figure out some way to leverage the features we already have, rather than muck further with the function declaration syntax, mainly because function declarations are _already hairy_ thanks to the various ways one can write down functions/closures/methods.\n\n---\n\nMy current brain-storming has focused on whether we could leverage the existing struct syntax, perhaps by adding default expressions for fields in the definition of a struct item.  That would then allow one to have some fields that could be dropped and others that would be required.  Something like:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo { x: int = 0, y:int = 0, z:int = 0 }\n\nfn bar(f: Foo) {\n    printf!(f);\n}\n\nstruct Baz { x: int, y: int, z:int = 0 }\n\nfn quux(g: Baz} {\n    printf!(g);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    bar(Foo{y: 5});\n    quux(Baz{y: 5}); // ~ERROR: required field, `x`\n}\n```\n",

    "body": "> re. anonymous structs i think they originally had those but had to remove them 'because of strange interactions' ?\n\nOriginally all struct types were structural. They  were removed (replaced with nominal struct types) because of awkward interactions with traits, I believe.\n\nI like the default values in struct definitions idea. This seems easy to understand and at least avoids having to enumerate every field when constructing a struct - this is a problem for \"options\" type structs because it means that when a new \"optional\" field is added then every call site must be modified to initialize it to 0/None/etc.\n",

    "body": "Coming from Perl (where defaults are an ad-hoc pattern), Python 2 (where you can get `foo() takes at least 2 arguments (2 given)`), and Python 3 (where you can have named-only arguments _without_ defaults), I humbly propose: add a _teeny_ bit of sugar to allow declaring a struct as the final argument to a function, but let the caller _inline_ the struct fields.\n\ne.g.\n\n```\nimpl int {\n    struct FromStrOptions {\n        radix: uint = 10\n    }\n    fn from_str(s: str, opts: FromStrOptions) -> int {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nint::from_str(\"4\", radix: 10);\n```\n\nAdvantages:\n- No new syntax for the function definition, which doesn't actually have to care at all how the caller calls it.  This is akin to how passing blocks with `do` works: it's purely the caller's concern.  (Does there need to be a way to opt in/out, for the case of having a last argument that's a struct but not intending that it be used for kwargs?  Would anyone care?  I don't think anyone cares for `do`.)\n- Binary layout and C call semantics and etc. are still pretty well-defined.\n- Overloading by type or arity is no more difficult to implement someday, save that the final argument's type can't contribute to type overloading.  Shouldn't interfere with variadic args, either, if those ever happen.\n- Same set of defaults can be reused in multiple functions.\n- Something like `**kwargs` for free: just create the struct and pass it as a positional arg instead.\n- Required keyword arguments fall naturally out of this: just don't give a default in the struct, and you're forced to pass _something_ by name.\n- No wacky confusion when passing positional arguments by name; you just can't do that.\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Slightly magical.  But no moreso than passing `5` and having the type inferred from the function's argspec, I think.\n- Unclear how it'd interact with the existing `do` idiom.  Might be easy enough to say it has to be the last argument _written_, i.e. it works as the second-to-last argument only when used with `do`.\n",

Project lead @brson suggested that we leave prototyping anything on this task for post-1.0 (e.g. for a 1.1 release).\n\nSo that is a strong hint to all contributors: hack all you like, but please do not submit pull requests or r+ anything for this bug until post 1.0 release.\n",

    "body": "Hands down, Rust is an amazing language. It does so many things right it's not even funny. But I think postponing this feature for post 1.0 is a mistake.\n\nLet me elaborate.\n\nDefault function arguments are _critical_ for good API design; the lack of them complicates what would otherwise be simpler APIs. Examples from the std library:\n- [`concat` and `connect`](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/str/trait.StrVector.html) instead of just `concat` that optionally takes a separator.\n- [`split_iter` and `splitn_iter`](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/str/trait.StrSlice.html#tymethod.split_iter) over just `split_iter` with an optional `count`. Same thing with `rsplit_iter` and `rsplitn_iter`.\n\nAnd others.\n\nHaving all these extra function names that could be removed with default arguments unnecessarily increases cognitive load. The user now has to know two (or more) names instead of one.\n\nIf default arguments are postponed for after 1.0, then these functions in the std library cannot be removed because of backwards compatibility. This means that even if default arguments are added in the future and the \"vanilla\" version of the functions can now do the work of the other variants, the old variants will stick around and developers will have to know about them because someone will certainly use them, even if only by mistake.\n\nSo that extra cognitive load will remain _forever_.\n\n[N.B. The same argument can be made for parameter type-based function overloading (the current trait-based workaround is too cumbersome and the std library functions don't use it), but this issue is not the place for that discussion.]\n\nRust devs, thanks for working on Rust and making it awesome!\n",

    "body": "> It's not going to happen for 1.0, because there's an existing set of core languages features to either fix or remove before dreaming up very unessential syntactic sugar.\n\nI'm not saying that the other language features that need to be fixed/implemented are not more important; they probably are. But it's not either/or. All I'm saying is that this feature should be strongly considered for 1.0 (in addition to the other features) because not having it impacts the quality of the APIs in the std library _forever_.\n\nThis is probably a controversial opinion, but IMO programming languages live and die more by the APIs they provide than the core features in them. Python's \"batteries included\" std library sold the entire language. CPAN keeps Perl alive. .Net makes writing C# code awesome, and LINQ is the best thing since sliced bread. One of C++'s greatest failings is the lack of good, standardized APIs. Etc.\n\nThe APIs are critical to the success of a language so features that enable the creation of _good_ APIs shouldn't be discarded as \"unessential syntactic sugar\".\n",
