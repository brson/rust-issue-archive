    "body": "@graydon, I've updated this: added `split_char_no_trailing` (and `split_no_trailing`) which act like `str::lines`. This was easier, and seemed like it would be less surprising in terms of behaviour, than changing `split_char` and adding `split_char_keep_trailing`. (And, I noticed some old(?) code in compiletest, which I've converted to use the more appropriate str function.)\n\nAlso, I did some experimentation and it seems that it wouldn't be too difficult to convert many of the functions that return `~str` into `&str` in the str library: is it worth me spending my time doing that? (Just checking in case there is a broader plan in terms of rewrites/redesigns.)\n",
