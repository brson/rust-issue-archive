It sounds like functionality is being added, but no tests are being added as well?\n",

    "body": "As I see it rustpkg should not initialize the BuildContext before it is needed. The BuildContext mainly consists of WorkCache, and that is not needed for commands like \"rustpkg init\".  Therefore my main goal was to initialize BuildContext later in the build process.   \n\nRight now \"rustpkg init\" calls a method on the trait CtxMethods which is implemented by BuildContext, so you cannot run \"rustpkg init\"  without initializing BuildContext. Therefore I would like to replace the methods of CtxMethods with functions.\n\nIf you want to move run_cmd to a separate file, then you also need to move package_script to avoid circular dependencies, but that should probably have been a later  commit.\n\nI will retract this pull request and make a smaller request that removes CtxMethods. \n",
