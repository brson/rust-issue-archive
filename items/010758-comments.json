    "body": "Hm, it appears so, I'll close that once I land this.\n\nI'm not sure if we want to have official support for a JIT version of running rust code, although if it's a fairly small amount of code I guess there's not too much of a problem having it. I think it'd be awesome if it were possible to link to `librustc` and have something like `librustjit` or something like that. Basically it would be possible to have the JIT as its own external library (in theory).\n",
