  "body": "A few reasons:\n- `Nullable` is basically unused, save for one argument in the `glob` function in `liblibc`, so this change likely impacts nobody negatively. The constructors are never used, and I don't foresee people using them. The people implementing the glob functionality don't seem to be reaching for this POSIX `glob` function, so it seems unlikely to be used heavily.\n- At the same time, the old name, `Some`, needlessly conflicted with the same re-exported name in the prelude, which impacted everybody who use glob imports with `libc`. Changing it to something else would simplify things greatly for those people.\n- `NotNull` seemed like the best option (others included `Just`, `Valid`, etc. which all had somewhat different connotations than what this type was going for (even `Some` doesn't quite seem like the opposite of `Null`)). Other options included removing the type completely and adding a special, `glob`-specific type. This latter approach doesn't seem future-proof.\n\nOverall, I feel like this is a mildly positive change.\n",
