    "body": "This seems like the wrong solution for a real problem to me. If our name resolution rules are difficult to understand, then that means we need more thorough documentation. I was under the impression that this was all well documented now, but I could very well be wrong! What rules are you referring to when you say that they're impossible to understand? These are real bugs that we need to get fixed before 1.0.\n\nA rule like this I feel is way too much of a special case for a common bug when as @bvssvni pointed out a warning would suffice just as well.\n",
