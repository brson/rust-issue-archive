  "body": "This pull request adds the `rust-gdb` shell script which starts GDB with Rust pretty printers enabled. The PR also makes `rustc` add a special `.debug_gdb_scripts` ELF section on Linux which tells GDB that the produced binary should use the Rust pretty printers.\n\nNote that at the moment this script will only work and be installed on Linux. On Mac OS X there's `rust-lldb` which works much better there. On Windows I had too many problems making this stable. I'll give it another try soonish.\n\nYou can use this script just like you would use GDB from the command line. It will use the pretty printers from the Rust \"installation\" found first in PATH. E.g. if you have `~/rust/x86_64-linux-gnu/stage1/bin` in your path, it will use the pretty printer scripts in `~/rust/x86_64-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustlib/etc`.\n",
