I think I recall copying this decision from .NET, but I'm ok trying to move flush to its own trait. If we do that I don't think it necessarily needs to extend Writer though.\n\nMy inclination though is that having a no-op flush is fine and convenient. Without the no-op flush, Writers that don't do buffering can't be used with code that expects to be able to flush.\n",

    "body": "I think that everything calling `fail!()` today is just a relic of having been not-implemented at the time of being written, so I don't think that anything ever intended to actually fail.\n\nOther than that, I'm a little bit in favor of having `flush` on the `Writer` trait because I always fear trait-explosion problems. That being said, I wouldn't be opposed at all to having a `Flush` trait. I'd agree with @brson that it probably doesn't need to extend `Writer`.\n\nOne problem that should be addressed though: If a `BufferedWriter` has a flushable underlying `Writer`, when the buffered version is flushed the writer should also be flushed. Otherwise, if the underlying writer isn't flushable, just the buffered writer should be flushed. I don't think that this would be possible if we extract `flush` from `Writer` (although I could be wrong).\n",

    "body": "I would think that pulling `flush` out to a separate trait would actually hurt the ability to write generic code, at least if a `FlushableWriter` or whatever extends `Writer`. Code written to work with a `Writer` will not work properly if it's called with a `BufferedWriter` since it won't flush.\n\nI think better options would be to either have a default no-op `flush` implementation, or have completely separate `FlushableWriter` and `Writer` traits with adapter structs to turn a `Writer` into a `FlushableWriter` and vice versa.\n",

    "body": "So there was a PR/issue somewhere that mentions pulling in chris morgan's `BufferedStream` from rust-http. In there, I argued for splitting out a Buffered and Unbuffered stream and pushing those details down into the `RtioFoo` traits.. I think this discussion dovetails with that..\n\ntl;dr -- i want to push Seek, flush, etc and all of that out of an UnbufferedStream (which basically would/behave like an fd accessed only w/ pread/pwrite) .. and we can do Seek, `flush`, etc in a BufferedStream, whose impl would be IO backend-specific.. \n",
