    "body": "It looks like the error here is when you're building Cargo, and that looks like it's a bug because you're using the HEAD rust to build Cargo. Unfortunately Cargo will currently only reliably build with a pinned version of the compiler (due to its usage of unstable features). This should be fixed in the next rustup for Cargo though!\n",
