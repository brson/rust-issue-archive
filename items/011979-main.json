  "body": "This pull request partially addresses the 2 issues listed before. As part of the work required for this PR, `NonCopyable` was completely removed.\n\nThis PR also replaces the content of `type_is_pod` with `TypeContents::is_pod`, although `type_is_content` is currently not being used anywhere. I kept it for consistency with the other functions that exist in this module.\n\ncc #10834\ncc #10577\n# Proposed static restrictions\n\nTaken from [this](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11979#issuecomment-35768249) comment.\n\nI expect some code that, at a high-level, works like this:\n- For each _mutable_ static item, check that the **type**:\n  - cannot own any value whose type has a dtor\n  - cannot own any values whose type is an owned pointer\n- For each _immutable_ static item, check that the **value**:\n  - does not contain any ~ or box expressions (including ~[1, 2, 3] sort of things, for now)\n  - does not contain a struct literal or call to an enum variant / struct constructor where\n    - the type of the struct/enum is freeze\n    - the type of the struct/enum has a dtor\n",
