  "body": "I didn't add an equivalent free function for `map_consume_default`, `mutate` and `mutate_default` because as far as I can tell the only purpose of the free function versions is backwards compatibility.\n\nThe `mutate` methods are based on a need I have in my balanced tree implementation, which arises from doing it entirely without `Copy`/`Clone`. It factors out variations of the following pattern which occurs many times:\n\n```\nif foo.inner_option.is_some() {\n    let inner = swap_unwrap(&mut foo.inner_option);\n    inner = transform(inner);\n    foo.inner_option = Some(inner);\n}\n```\n",
