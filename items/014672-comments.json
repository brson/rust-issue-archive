Every LLDB version contains the bug and I don't think anything has to be compiled with debuginfo enabled. Just start LLDB, and set a breakpoint. I'm not sure you actually have to run the program. I have not investigated the exact circumstances that trigger the bug. However, my LLDB autotests (compiled with --prefer-dynamic) all ran into it.\n",

    "body": "It looks like it is indeed a problem: https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/99dc5ed5400268ab0ed2. When I try to set a breakpoint LLDB dies.\n\nThe problem is that whenever we suck in object files from library `foo`, we prefix them all with `r-foo-`, so in this case we're making an rlib with the object file `r-foobar-fooba.o` (exactly 16 characters). Neither `foobar` nor `fooba` are that long of names, so this may actually crop up occasionally.\n\nPerhaps we could just unconditionally rename files if they're 16 letters long? Something along the lines of:\n- If you insert a new file in an archive with exactly 16 characters, prepend `XX` to the front.\n- If you read a file from an archive with exactly 16 characters, look for the file with `XX` in front.\n\nI think we're only reading our own archives, so that should work for now.\n",

If we know all points where files are added and read from archives then just adding some prefix if needed is certainly a good idea. Fixing the `r-<libname>-` thing only is even easier. Just use something that will always make the name longer than 16 bytes, like `rust-qualified-<libname>-`, which admittedly is a bit ugly `:)`. \n\nIf we go down the smart-prefixing approach, which I prefer if we can make it work reliably, then it would probably be a good idea to make the prefix something that points to the problem it solves, like `lldb-fix-`. That would allow someone stumbling upon the strange, unexpected name to search rustc's code base and find out what this is all about.\n",
