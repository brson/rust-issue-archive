    "body": "The sequence of events that would lead to this error are:\n1. An rlib for library X is found\n2. The corresponding dylib for library X is found\n3. The corresponding dylib for library X is found again (listed in the search paths twice?)\n\nRight now this is an assertion that I used when debugging the introduction of rlibs, but I don't think that it's ok to override that assertion. If you've got /usr/local/lib as the installation directory for rust, then this is probably picking up the libstd that is used by rustc itself, and _not_ the target libstd which you're supposed to be linking against.\n\nAll in all, this is correctly an error today, although This should certainly not actually be an error. We advertise rust as being installable to /usr/local/lib, (or /usr/lib), and it looks like that doesn't quite work. This would need a resolution of #11145 to make further progress on this issue.\n\nIn the meantime, I would sadly recommend installing rustc itself not to /usr/local/lib, but you can continue to install all other rust libraries to /usr/local/lib.\n",
