    "body": "Hi Steve,\n\nUsually I would have rolled over by this point, but in the spirit of the quote by Emma Goldman on your blog, I will persist. :)  Taking out or adding \"the elided and expanded\" does not change the structure of the rest of the sentence.  It merely specifies which versions are meant by \"both.\"  This is the only relevant stackexachange I could find on the topic: http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/101332/both-the-first-and-the-last-plural-vs-both-the-first-and-the-last-singula\n\nI'd like to come up with something that we can both agree on unequivocally, so how about this?\n\n> Here are some examples of functions with elided lifetimes.  We've paired each example of an elided lifetime with its expanded form.\n\nI'm sorry if this whole thread has come off as a little too pugnacious on my part.  I really do admire the herculean documentation task that you've taken on as far as the Rust project is concerned.  I think it's some of the best documentation out there.\n\nThanks,\nLiam\n",
