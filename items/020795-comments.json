The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nick29581 (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@mahkoh and I talked briefly about atomics on IRC. The options seem to be:\n1. Just wrap. Document it, perhaps change name of methods.\n2. Abort process as @mahkoh suggests.\n3. Abort the thread, although the observed value may have been seen elsewhere.\n4. Wrap but return some indication of when wrapping occurred.\n5. Fallback to a CAS loop.\n\nEach has its own downsides. The first option is obviously prone to programmer error, particularly if someone is naively using an atomic to achieve some kind of global counter. That said, atomics are fairly specialized, and perhaps it should be expected. (Note: If we _don't_ wrap by default, then clearly we need explicit wrapping options whatever we do.)\n\nThe second process is heavy-handed. I am generally reluctant to abort an entire process as it is irrecoverable. However, this is only in debug mode -- but it impacts users who want to use checked overflowing even in optimized code, as aborting the process may not be an option for them.\n\nAborting the thread is insufficient in general since others may observe the values.\n\nAnother option is to wrap but return an enum that indicates if wrapping occurred. This seems to add some overhead and mainly serves to warn users that wrapping can occur, thus encouraging them to design a recovery strategy. Probably not very appealing.\n\nFalling back to a CAS loop gives irregular performance similarly may impact users who wish to turn on checked overflow by default (even outside debug mode).\n",

    "body": "Having given the question of atomics some more thought (and talked it over with @aturon), my feeling is that the best option is simply to clearly document the semantics of `AtomicInt` and friends as wrapping on overflow. Naturally this is something of a tradeoff. As I see it, using atomic ints and the like is somewhat advanced, and always rather isolated: it is much more reasonable to expect users to be aware of the possibility of overflow in that scenario, as compared to general arithmetic throughout the program (atomics are also much easier to audit). Finally, given that the recovery options are typically either drastic or expensive, there isn't really an appealing alternative.\n",
