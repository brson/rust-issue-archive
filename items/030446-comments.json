The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pnkfelix (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

I think you are saying: \"early const eval (before trans) cannot handle assoc constants. If we want to allow associated constants to be handled by early const eval, we should ensure that they do not reference other associated constants, because those are not handled by early const eval\". But it seems like they _would_ be handled by early const eval if... they were handled by early const eval? \n\nBut in any case I think that for assoc constants to be allowed in array lengths, we would have to move beyond the notion of early/late const eval, which is (imo) incorrect. Basically, we would sometimes have abstract array lengths that we can only determine precisely at trans time (but we may still know that two array lengths are the same, even if we don't know what they are yet).\n",
