    "body": "In you first example, `{:6>}` corresponds to  a fill character of `6` and a right alignment, for example:\n\n``` rust\nformat!(\"A{:6>6}A\", \"hi\") // => \"A6666hiA\"\n```\n\nYour second example seems to behave as expected, and your last example also seems to be working as intended. The fill character is only consumed if an accepted alignment follows, and rust, unlike python, does not have the `^` alignment specifier.\n\nDoes that resolve the ambiguity here?\n",

    "body": "That explains it. I just want to add that `format!(\"{:*>}\", ...)` where `*` denotes any character is basically a no-op. You have to also specify the width for both the filling character and the alignment spec to take effect.\n",
