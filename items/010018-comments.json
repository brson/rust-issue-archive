Isn't that only used for constant expressions (i.e., `static` decls and enum discriminants and that sort of thing?). And the compile-fail tests don't include expected error messages, so they won't pass. It shouldn't be hard to adapt this code to run at lint time instead though -- basically just visit all literal expressions, examine the type assigned to them, and check whether the literal fits. For extra credit, you would track whether the literal is enclosed within a unary minus so as to distinguish the fun edge case:\n\nlet x: i8 = 128;  // ideally, would warn\nlet x: i8 = -128; // should not\nlet x: i8 = -(128); // and this shouldn't either\nlet x: i8 = -{128}; // but you've got to draw the line somewhere, so it'd be ok if this did :)\n",

    "body": "I moved to code to the linter and fixed the test.\n\nAs it turns out, checking \n\n```\n let x: i8 = -128; // should not \n```\n\nis a tricky case. It's represented as `ExprUnary(_, NegOp, ExprLit(lit))` but `lit` holds the positive value (128) instead of the negative value, so there is some extra work needed to check if the `ExprLit` follows a `NegOp`. A quick and dirty solution would be to pass the information through the walk calls (https://github.com/fhahn/rust/commit/d468bbf3cfe3d06fc51b8d38c08c8b467f78a3cd#diff-1e2a5771a9e8a30cc0802838a4a9da9dR529 ), but there's probably a much better solution (with my solution `let x:i8 = --128;` does not warn and there must be special handling for cases like `let x: i8 = -(128);`). The `ExprLit` inside `ExprBinary` has a negative value, maybe all `ExprLit` should be folded and contain the literal with a correct sign before calling the linter.\n\nAnother thing I noticed: the overflow check for typed literals does handle edge cases correctly:\n\n```\nlet x = 128_i8; // does not fail\nlet x = 129_i8; // does fail\n```\n\nBut I guess once the check for overflows is handled by the linter, we could remove the check in check_const.rs? https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/check_const.rs#L206\n",

    "body": "Ordinarily I'd say that this is exactly the kind of case where a `bool` parameter is appropriate, except that this visitor appears to be used for many different lints. Therefore I agree with @huonw that a field is more appropriate. However, a field has the disadvantage that it's easily _forgotten_ -- for example, if `visit_stmt` or some such failed to clear the field, then `let x = - { let y = 128u8; 22 }` would fail to warn. In general, I always get afraid when writing \"context passing\" visitors that some new intermediate level will be added and screw up my code anyhow. \n\nMy suggestion (which may well be overkill) is to add a field, but rather than making it a boolean, have its type be a `NodeId`. For example, `negated_expr: ast::NodeId`. Then the unary negative expr can set `negated_expr = operand.id`, and `ExprParen` can do `if self.negated_expr == expr.id { self.negated_expr = parenthesized_expr.id; }`, and finally literals can compare `if self.negated_expr == self.id`.  Everybody else can just ignore the field altogether.\n\nIn general though this looks great, exactly what I had in mind.\n",

    "body": "I've added the warnings to the two failing tests, they should pass now.\n\nBut I was wondering if merging the type-limits and the type-overflow linter message would make sense. \n\n```\nfn bar() -> i8 {\n    return 123;\n}\nfn baz() -> bool {\n    128 > bar() //~ ERROR comparison is useless due to type limits\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the comparison is useless, because 128 does not fit into an `i8` and there is a overflow. With \"literal out of range for its type\" as the only warning, you could easily draw the same conclusion. \nGetting rid of the \" comparison is useless due to type limits\" in favor of the more general \"literal out of range for its type\" would also be more consistent with other cases. Consider\n\n```\nfn bar() -> i8 {\n     return 123;\n}\n\nfn baz() -> i8{\n    128 + bar()\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the warning would be \"literal out of range for its type\" instead of something like \"addition is useless due to type limits\" .\n\nAre logical operators special enough to have a separate warning?\n",
