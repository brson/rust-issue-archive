    "body": "This is happening because the underlying call to getaddrinfo doesn't provide an addrinfo as a hint, and so the linked list of returned addrinfo structs contains addrinfo for both TCP and UDP protocols.\n\nA simple fix would be to simply pass in a hint specifying only one protocol (e.g. TCP)\n\nHowever I'm not sure how often you'll find a hostname that has UDP available but not TCP and vice versa, and whether or not it's worth capturing that with something like LookupHostUdp and LookupHostTcp.\n",
