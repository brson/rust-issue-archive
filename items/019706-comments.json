    "body": " @andrewchambers, I read the situation differently than you do.\n\na) Rust isn't anywhere near gcc's level of popularity, platform vendors like Intel and ARM themselves devote significant resources to ensuring that gcc runs well on their platforms, so that a binary would always be available. Rust is not (yet?) in that position, and must rely on volunteer effort to port to alternative platforms. And since the language and compiler are evolving so rapidly, the compiler needs to be regularly re-ported to second-class platforms. I can't say for sure today, but before GCC achieved ubiquity, they absolutely worried about bootstrapping (for example making sure they were bootstrappable by things like Sun's compiler suite). Granted, the world has changed a lot since then, VMs are much easier to set up, and cross-compilation is easier than it used to be. But if the build process can be designed such that a VM isn't necessary (and if it isn't too onerous to do so), then why a VM be forced onto porters?\n\nb) To demonstrate real value, there at least needs to be a proof-of-concept. Right now, the proof-of-concept is harder to demonstrate than it might need to be.\n\nFor what it's worth, I filed this partly to gauge interest in the idea. I'm willing to investigate this solution, but only if it seems like there's a possibility of a payoff...\n",

    "body": "@andrewchambers GCC can in theory be bootstrapped as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Use whatever C compiler you have to build GCC 4.7, the last version before the 2012-08 conversion to C++\r\n2. Use that to bootstrap more recent GCC\r\n\r\n> I can't imagine a realistic situation where there is no access to a machine capable of cross compilation.\r\n\r\nThe situation would be a protocol to avoid self-propagating compiler trojans like those described in \"[Reflections on Trusting Trust]\" by Ken Thompson. When there exist multiple independent implementations of a particular language, the [diverse double-compiling] (DDC) defense described by David A. Wheeler can be used. But because there are no other implementations of the Rust language, the process must start with a DDC-verified compiler. Thus there needs to be some way to go from source code in a diversely implemented language, such as C++, to something that can compile Rust.\r\n\r\n[Reflections on Trusting Trust]: http://vxer.org/lib/pdf/Reflections%20on%20Trusting%20Trust.pdf\r\n[diverse double-compiling]: https://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/",

    "body": "The rust compiler used to be implemented in Ocaml. You are free to bootstrap all the way from that version to master if Ken scares you, unless you believe the Ocaml tools have code hidden inside them to detect whether they are compiling a Rust compiler, but at that point you're probably excessively paranoid.\r\n\r\nRegardless, there is a project to implement a Rust compiler in c++, so soon (tm) you will be able to bootstrap that way as well.
