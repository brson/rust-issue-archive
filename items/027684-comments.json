    "body": "OK, I've read over this entire PR. As usual, very satisfying.\n\nMy one worry: some of the removals are APIs that were deprecated in 1.3 (currently in beta), whose replacements were also introduced in 1.3. That risks introducing a strong split between the nightly and stable ecosystems.\n\nIn general, we want for deprecations to only take effect once a stable release providing their replacement is available -- and the same is even more true for removals. When we haven't done this, e.g. with `connect` -> `join`, it's been a hassle for people. We've talked about using the `since` attribute to not even warn until the relevant release has hit stable.\n\nI'm not sure whether this is a blocker; I feel like we don't have a ton of experience to go from here. Thoughts?\n",

The APIs are unstable so they can't be used in beta/stable anyways so the ecosystem was already split.\n",

    "body": "Er, after thinking about this some more:\n\n> In general, we want for deprecations to only take effect once a stable release providing their replacement is available -- and the same is even more true for removals.\n\nI totally agree for stable APIs we want this, but it's not as clear to me that we want this same guarantee for unstable APIs. Once an unstable API is deprecated the second you see that is the second you have the replacement available to you. In that sense I don't think it's as pressing that we leave around unstable + deprecated APIs for a long time.\n\nIt's certainly nice to still have a grace period as projects tracking nightly update every so often, but a 2-ish releases may be a bit much.\n",
