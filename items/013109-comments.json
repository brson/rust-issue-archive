It's pretty easy to ignore them via an `allow` attribute, and once we start adding special cases it's unknown where we draw the line.\n\n@bvssvni, do you know if there's precedent for this sort of exception? Googling around for camel case I didn't find anything related to this. Is there a reason that an `allow` attribute doesn't suffice for you?\n",

For example, all bindings to windows functions have to opt-out of the lints because they use camel case for variables and often uppercase variables. Additionally, LLVM has quite different style than rust does.\n\nI would imagine that an `#[allow]` at the top of the generated bindings would be sufficient for the entire block of generated code?\n",
