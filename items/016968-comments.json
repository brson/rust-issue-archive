Almost every example just uses `int`, which is almost never what you want. (The in my opinion only legitimate use of `int` I can think of right now is `offset` and similar pointer arithmetic, which does not occur in safe code.)\n\nI think even small programs should not use `int` as it is currently defined. The current practice only works as long as the code does not need integers larger than what `i32` can represent. So why not just use `i32`?\n",

    "body": "@vks `int` is large enough to hold any memory address, so it's suitable for [slicing](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/trait.ImmutableSlice.html#tymethod.slice), [indexing](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/trait.ImmutableSlice.html#tymethod.get), [lengths](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/trait.Collection.html#tymethod.len), [sizes](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.size_of.html), unsafe pointer arithmetic, etc. Actually, I just realized the main signature `fn main(argc: int, argv: *const *const u8) -> int` uses int correctly. It looks like the manual defines them [correctly](http://doc.rust-lang.org/rust.html#primitive-types), but the guide doesn't cover the issue.\n\nI don't like the idea of granting a special place in the language to a particular fixed-size type. Also I run into i32 overflow pretty often, so I prefer i64. The fallback int is for prototyping only, and should be as large as possible without significantly compromising speed (like an emulated 32-bit on a 16-bit microcontroller, or an emulated 128-bit on a cpu with only 64-bit registers and operations), so it should be target dependent.\n\n@l0kod I think `intptr` and `uintptr` are the correct names, since `intptr_t` must be at least as large as `size_t` and `ptrdiff_t`. Also `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t` are the standard in C and C++. Using a newly coined name like \"index\", \"offset\", or \"size\" would add confusion. And `isize`/`usize`/`offset` are all incorrect in environments (like segmented memory) where the address space is larger than the maximum possible size. `iaddr`/`uaddr` are correct alternatives, but why invent a new name?\n",

It is implicitly advertised as a default in most documentation and examples.\n> I think most people learning Rust will be using `int` instead of the fixed size types, because of the way it is taught.\n\nThat's right. Moreover, one-letter suffixes like `u` and `i` are also to blame because they are so sweet to use. They looks like default integer types.\n",

    "body": "After reading through both comment threads I think I agree that while at first glance it sounds like a reasonable modification it seems to have the potential of becoming a bad default in certain cases. And it's not like the lack of fallback is _that_ painful to work with, the compiler messages are generally very explicit and the suffixes are not generally very intrusive.\n\nI mean, if you consider the examples in the RFC:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut m = HashMap::new();\nm.insert(1, 2);\nm.insert(3, 4);\nassert_eq(m.find(&3).map(|&i| i).unwrap(), 4);\n```\n\nIn today's rust would be:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut m = HashMap::new();\nm.insert(1i, 2i);\nm.insert(3, 4);\nassert_eq(m.find(&3).map(|&i| i).unwrap(), 4);\n```\n\nAnd\n\n``` rust\nfor _ in range(0, 10) {\n}\n```\n\nBecomes\n\n``` rust\nfor _ in range(0u, 10) {\n}\n```\n\nThe RFC states that it might deter newcomers but I think it's a moot point because if they come from C/C++ they still save massively on having to specify all the types and if they come from dynamically typed languages it might give them the false impression that those counter values have no type or are dynamically typed or that their type does not matter, which isn't strictly true in all the cases.\n",
