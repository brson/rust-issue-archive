It may be a little tricky to do at certain phases of the compiler, because the current for-loop expansion moves the label into the _inside_ of a block (basically implicitly building in the scoping semantics outlined by @arielb1 above), so I don't think I can meaningfully do the analysis post expansion, at least, not without knowing enough to skip over such blocks as not introducing an inner scope.)\n\ncurrent branch is here: https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust/commit/fsk-detect-duplicate-loop-labels\n\n---\n\nsemi-ironically, I think the fact that the loop-label ends up inside a block in the expansion is my own fault; due to #21984\n",
