For normal, LLVM can still decide to inline if it decides that it'd be better, but we don't provide a way for this to happen cross-crate (because we only write the necessary metadata for `#[inline]` and `#[inline(always)]`), that's what this PR is providing.\n",

This is probably the right behavior since it's consistent - you know that no `#[inline(maybe)]` calls are into dynamic libraries - but I could imagine LLVM being smart enough to defer to the external function if it's not inlined.\n\nWhen an `#[inline(maybe)]` function is copied but not inlined you do save some small amount, depending on platform, for not interacting with the dynamic linker.\n\nI suppose that it is difficult to know when to choose `#[inline(maybe)]` over `#[inline]`.
