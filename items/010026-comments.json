I agree with @huonw that we should probably just replace it with `BindByValue` and then taking a mutability argument seems to make the most sense to me.\n\nAlso, would you mind expending the `lint-unused-mut.rs` test a bit to include the new cases where mutability is allowed? Other than that, this looks great!\n",

Otherwise, if you add some tests with errors about mutable matches, I'd r+ this.
