  "body": "Originally, this was my 30 minute introduction, and we eventually made\nit the opener to the book. But as #25918 has shown, the example I use\nhere has some issues. The good news is that Rust makes heap allocation\nsyntatically expensive, but the bad news is that that means showing\nequivalent programs from Rust and other languages is difficult. After\nthinking about it, I'm not sure this section is pulling its weight, and\nsince it has problems, I'd rather just pull it than try to re-write it\nright now. I think the book is fine without it.\n\nFIxes #25918\n",
