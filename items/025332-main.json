  "body": "The `FunctionContext` is now passed around mutably pretty much everywhere.\n\nThe `RefCell` motherlode in trans is in the local crate context, but I think this part can stand on its own.  I did check to see if I could make the local crate context mutable really easily, but after a few tests I think it would require enough additional work that it probably isn't worth delaying this PR submission.\n",
