    "body": "Yes, this is basically the same as that issue. You can't implement a trait you don't own for a type you don't own. So it's not possible to implement standard library traits, like `Clone`, for standard library types that don't have them already, like `[T; N]`.\n\nIn addition, Rust already provides a Cell type, so you may end up with weird shadowing errors.\n\nThis issue is going to end up needing https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1038 to be fixed, so I'm giving it a close.\n",
