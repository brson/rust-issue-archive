    "body": "Similarly to #9194, I'm hesitant to include more half-baked implementations into `libstd` when we've got enough of a half-baked runtime already. I don't think that this is a critical problem right now which needs to be fixed as soon as possible. This certainly needs to be fixed for this module to even be considered to move outside of `unstable`, however.\n\nI do think that statically initialized mutexes would be a useful thing to have, and this is certainly a good place where they'd be nice to have.\n\nThat being said, this isn't the worst thing ever, so if there are indeed good reasons to get this patched over for now, I think that we could include it.\n",
