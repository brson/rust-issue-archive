  "body": "This commit is an implementation of [RFC 565](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0565-show-string-guidelines.md) which is a stabilization of\nthe `std::fmt` module and the implementations of various formatting traits.\nSpecifically, the following changes were performed:\n- The `Show` trait is now deprecated, it was renamed to `Debug`\n- The `String` trait is now deprecated, it was renamed to `Display`\n- Many `Debug` and `Display` implementations were audited in accordance with the\n  RFC and audited implementations now have the `#[stable]` attribute\n  - Integers and floats no longer print a suffix\n  - Smart pointers no longer print details that they are a smart pointer\n  - Paths with `Debug` are now quoted and escape characters\n- The `unwrap` methods on `Result` now require `Display` instead of `Debug`\n- The `Error` trait no longer has a `detail` method and now requires that\n  `Display` must be implemented. With the loss of `String`, this has moved into\n  libcore.\n- `impl<E: Error> FromError<E> for Box<Error>` now exists\n- `derive(Show)` has been renamed to `derive(Debug)`. This is not currently\n  warned about due to warnings being emitted on stage1+\n\nWhile backwards compatibility is attempted to be maintained with a blanket\nimplementation of `Display` for the old `String` trait (and the same for\n`Show`/`Debug`) this is still a breaking change due to primitives no longer\nimplementing `String` as well as modifications such as `unwrap` and the `Error`\ntrait. Most code is fairly straightforward to update with a rename or tweaks of\nmethod calls.\n\n[breaking-change]\nCloses #21436\n",
