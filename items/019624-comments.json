    "body": "Some thoughts from IRC:\n1. One easy option is to use the `tidy` script to do a check across all crates. This would require making the `E123` syntax something more greppable as part of the `span_err` macro (e.g., `#E123#`).\n2. Another option is to have the crates have individual tables then get reconciled at runtime (or compilation time). This requires more work and I fear that we will add a crate and then forget to include that crate in the list of crates whose diagnostic tables must be reconciled.\n3. I don't want to namespace the `E` codes by crate because I want the freedom to change crates as we like.\n",

    "body": "I was thinking more. I think that we should introduce an abstraction layer between the identifier that is present _in the code_ and the error code that _the user sees_. I actually think this has the potential to solve all of these problems and then some more.\n\nHere is how I envision it working:\n\nIn the main crate (probably driver), we compile a list of all the error codes. The list looks like this:\n\n```\nerror_codes! {\n...\nE0123, ERR_MISMATCHED_TYPES, \"some detailed comments\";\n...\n}\n```\n\nthen in the code instead of writing `span_err!(...E0123...)` we write `span_err!(...ERR_MISMATCHED_TYPES...)`. By convention, whatever naming scheme we use for these codes (e.g., `ERR_FOO`) should be distinctive enough that we can easily find it using a simple regular expression. We then write a python script that scrapes these codes out of the `librustc_*` directories and checks them against the master list in driver. At runtime, the driver can install a master table in TLS (much as it does today) or the session or whatever, and we can translate from `ERR_MISMATCHED_TYPES` to `E0123`.\n\nAdvantages of this scheme:\n- Python script can easily check conformance, no need to write a complicated cross-crate plugin.\n- Merge conflicts are easily resolved: right now it's a pain because you have to update the diagnostics.rs file (where the merge conflict occurs) but _also_ all uses of the code. \n- You can report the same conceptual error from multiple spots in the code without contortions or warning (right now you get a warning about using the same code E123 twice -- but if codes were more descriptive, that wouldn't be a bad thing to do).\n\nNow, we could arguably go one step further and just NOT USE NUMERIC CODES at all. It's not clear what advantage numeric codes offer over some distinct keyword like `ERR_MISMATCHED_TYPES`. In that case, we could remove all the cross-crate checking completely since we wouldn't expect overlap between identifiers, and we can just check crates locally, though we still need some way to compile a master list, so we may still want to use roughly the scheme I described here. @brson you may have an opinion about numeric vs descriptive codes.\n\nOne thing I might like is that we do offer a mode for using the descriptive names rather than the numeric code in the output (perhaps a -Z flag). The reason for this is that I would like all the tests in `src/test/compile-fail` to eventually use `//~ ERROR ERR_MISMATCHED_TYPES` rather than the _actual string_. This would make them much less fragile to refactoring error messages. We could use (and I have been using whenever possible) `//~ ERROR E0123` but the problem is that this is prone to merge conflicts when numbers clash.\n",

    "body": "Here's my revised proposal, which is substantially similar to niko's\n- Get rid of the `__diagnostic_used` and `__register_diagnostic` builtins that try to enforce sanity at compile time, as well as `__build_diagnostics_array`. All this logic will be handled through either a tidy script or normal macros.\n- Change the current invocation syntax to make the error codes more distinctive, like `%E0000`, which appears nowhere in the existing source.\n- Add a single file in the driver that includes two macro invocations:\n  - `error_codes! { }` - basic metadata per Niko. There would be a comment above it saying to never remove an existing code.\n  - `extended_errors! { }` - optional detailed information\n- Add a tidy script that ensures that each of the `%ENNNN` strings is unique, that they all exist in 'error_codes'.\n- Update the `span_err` etc macros to accept either the numeric codes or the descriptive codes.\n",
