    "body": "> So just to check I poked around at some other libraries to see what they do. In libuv at least, nothing with signals is handled in terms of forking, but they also don't by default disable SIGPIPE\n\nlibuv _appears_ to be processing signals via signal handlers. I can look in more detail if you think it's interesting, but if they're doing handlers instead of a thread and [asking library users to ignore `SIGPIPE` themselves](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/45#issuecomment-66100888), strictly speaking none of this is their responsibility (and I'm also a little unsure if they've thought through their signals-and-subprocesses story enough to be a worthwhile reference). Rust libstd ignores `SIGPIPE`, so it incurs that responsibility, and while there's no signal-handling API in libstd, mio (for instance) wants to avoid handler functions to avoid `EINTR` problems. But without cooperation from libstd, unintentionally masking all signals in children is a bad plan.\n\n> I couldn't make heads or tails of what Ruby does\n\nSeems to get this right:\n\n```\nhowe-and-ser-moving:~ geofft$ ruby -e 'open(\"/proc/self/status\").each_line { |line| puts line if line.include? \"SigIgn\" }'\nSigIgn: 0000000000001000\nhowe-and-ser-moving:~ geofft$ ruby -e 'puts `grep SigIgn /proc/self/status`'\nSigIgn: 0000000000000000\n```\n\n> but it didn't look like Python did much with signal masks or forking despite ignoring SIGPIPE like we are.\n\nPython 3 (at least 3.4) appears to have fixed this relative to Python 2.7:\n\n```\nhowe-and-ser-moving:~ geofft$ python2 -c 'print [line for line in open(\"/proc/self/status\") if \"SigIgn\" in line][0]'\nSigIgn: 0000000001001000\n\nhowe-and-ser-moving:~ geofft$ python2 -c 'import subprocess; print subprocess.check_output([\"grep\", \"SigIgn\", \"/proc/self/status\"])'\nSigIgn: 0000000001001000\n\nhowe-and-ser-moving:~ geofft$ python3 -c 'print([line for line in open(\"/proc/self/status\") if \"SigIgn\" in line][0])'\nSigIgn: 0000000001001000\n\nhowe-and-ser-moving:~ geofft$ python3 -c 'import subprocess, sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(subprocess.check_output([\"grep\", \"SigIgn\", \"/proc/self/status\"]))'\nSigIgn: 0000000000000000\n```\n\n> Shouldn't that be up to the application instead of the library here instead? For example this makes it so it's impossible to spawn a process with a signal mask in place through the `Command` API. This info also makes me uneasy about ignoring `SIGPIPE` by default, but I think that setting it to `SIG_DFL` here is fine.\n\nYeah, I do actually mostly agree: there is definitely a use case for intentionally starting a child with ignored signals, e.g., writing `nohup` in Rust. (I'm less convinced there's a use case for starting a child with a mask, but [`posix_spawn` supports it](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/posix_spawnattr_getsigmask.html), so whatever.) What would be nice is a method on the `Command` object to change signal handling, just like the methods to change standard I/O inheritance -- and a static method that allows libraries to reset signal behaviors (or perhaps run a general-purpose `unsafe fn` to clean things up) post-fork. But I don't think we need that immediately. I was planning on non-urgently sending in a PR or writing a third-party crate to add some methods to do these sorts of things, but this current PR fixes the immediate problem with `SIGPIPE`, and also enables libraries like mio to turn on signal masks safely.\n\nIf you're worried about the regression possibility with signal masks (although the docs don't promise anything either way, and I can't imagine any users will ever care, let alone have cared), we could set things up to reset `SIGPIPE`, and also offer a static method that an external library like mio can call to undo its signal mask. That would also solve my immediate problem, although it's more complexity and unsafe code surface, and I don't think it gains us anything in practice. If you're just worried about the ability to set signal masks one way or another, I can get you a separate PR for that, though probably not immediately.\n",

    "body": "Yeah I think the change here to reset `SIGPIPE` back to `SIG_DFL` is definitely the right way to go (e.g. we differ from libuv here). My only pause now is whether to reset the sigmask on a spawn. For example the test here does not require the procmask to be reset, and nor does anything else in the standard library. \n\nPerhaps a test could be added at least which requires procmask to be reset on spawn? I think it's fine to do, but it'd be nice to have a regression test to ensure it's not accidentally removed as well!\n",

    "body": "@bstrie: Opened #25872.\n\n@nagisa: If you `SIG_IGN` something other than `SIGPIPE`, then yes, there's currently no way to reset that. If you set a signal-handling function, UNIX resets it to `SIG_DFL` on exec. There should eventually be a way to un-ignore signals before exec, but I think it's less urgent. I don't think that there's a strong use case for ignoring any signal other than `SIGPIPE` in the current process only. Of the terminate-by-default signals, most are things like `SIGSEGV` where you can't ignore them, or things like `SIGHUP` that are generally sent to the entire process _group_ (so you want behavior to be inherited). Besides those two groups, the rest, other than `SIGPIPE`, appear to not be automatically generated (`SIGUSR1`, `SIGUSR2`, `SIGPIPE`, `SIGIO`, etc.), so you don't even get them in the first place unless you specifically want them. So I doubt anyone will be needing this badly in the immediate future, although yes, the functionality should exist at some point.\n\n(BTW, current status of this PR is that I _just_ got an Android build working locally, and I'm trying to figure out why the buildbot is unhappy.)\n",

    "body": "OK, I've gotten this passing against Android API level 18 locally, and rebased against current HEAD. The big problem was that, until Android API level 21 (introduced in Android 5.0), several of the signal-handling functions were _only_ exposed as C inline functions: see [Android 4.4's `<signal.h>`](https://github.com/android/platform_bionic/blob/android-4.4_r1/libc/include/signal.h). So we need to translate those to Rust ourselves. I've kept that as a separate commit to make it easy to revert once the API level is bumped, but [that's unlikely to be a good idea for a while](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#Platform). This feels ugly and I'm open to style suggestions, but I don't think it'll ever be non-ugly.\n\nAlso, my run-pass test case wasn't working on Android for lack of either `yes` or `head`, but it turns out that [Android's dynamic linker unconditionally sets a `SIGPIPE` handler](https://github.com/android/platform_bionic/blob/android-5.1.0_r1/linker/debugger.cpp) on all processes (to tell debuggerd to take a crash dump), so the question of `SIGPIPE` inheritance is completely irrelevant on Android. I suppose this makes sense, given that Android is primarily a mobile platform, not a UNIX, and if your _app_ dies with `SIGPIPE` you'd want to know. So I disabled the test on Android. It mostly exists to catch changes in `std::process`'s semantics, so it doesn't need to run on all platforms.\n",
