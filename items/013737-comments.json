    "body": "Discussion is fine.\n\nThe intent of this trait is to be used where current code uses `ClonaeableVector`. E.g. I have a function\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<V: CloneableVector<u8>>(v: V) {\n    let v = v.into_owned();\n    // do stuff with v\n}\n```\n\nIn order to convert this over to `Vec<u8>` instead of `~[u8]`, I need a way to convert both `&[T]` and `~[T]` into a `Vec<T>`, which is what `IntoVec<T>` provides. So the equivalent function is\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<V: IntoVec<u8>>(v: V) {\n    let v = v.into_vec();\n    // do stuff with v\n}\n```\n\n`IntoVec<T>` is missing `to_vec()` (the equivalent to `CloneableVector<T>::to_owned()`) because that method requires `Clone`, and `into_vec()` should be usable on `~[T]` and `Vec<T>` without `T: Clone` (the impl for `&[T]` still requires `Clone`, of course). Also I don't think a `.to_vec()` trait method is particularly useful.\n\nIt's worth noting that `std::str::Str` contains `to_strbuf()` and `into_strbuf()` methods.\n",
