    "body": "You don't \"allocate DST-s\" in Rust: for trait objects, you allocate a regular struct and then cast the `&Struct` to an `&Trait` (or `Box<Struct>` to `Box<Trait>`), and for arrays you use something like `Vec`, which malloc-s a block of memory and creates a `&mut [T]` with the right length that points to it.\n\nTrait objects already work with arenas, and teaching `Vec` about them requires allocator traits.\n",
