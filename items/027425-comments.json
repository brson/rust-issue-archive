    "body": "Not enough demand, maybe? Rust follows a minimalist philosophy: the standard library doesn't try to cover all possible use-cases, only the ones that appear to be the most common.\n\nThat said, this sounds like it could be pretty useful, especially in unit tests that are expecting failure. I don't see any mention of an `expect_err` counterpart on the discussion for [the original `Result::expect()` RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1119). I guess no one thought to consider it.\n\nIf you want to try drafting an RFC to propose adding `Result::expect_err()`, [this is a good place to start](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#before-creating-an-rfc). It's common practice to post the draft on https://internals.rust-lang.org first to get feedback on it.\n",

But since this is a small request and nobody has commented in over a year, I'm going to give this issue a close. Thanks!",
