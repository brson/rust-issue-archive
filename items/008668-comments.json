    "body": "IMO - \n[1]the first useful thing that springs to mind is the zero.rs idea of a subset running _without_ the runtime - i gather this might mean splitting the stdlibs into 2 layers.\n[1.1] this would facilitate ports.  \nThere is a niche in gamedev for being able to get onto new platforms _first_ -  my own career relied on that... launch titles for new consoles, in effect - doing games before the tools were widely available.(after doing a hit driving game on the PS1, we were approached to do one for dreamcast whilst that platform was in development, and then ported this for launch to the xbox - \nthis would have been impossible if we had dependancies on external libraries and were waiting for those to be ported)\n\n[1.2]\nIts much less common now , but some game-developpers still like to minimize use of dynamic memory allocators, and we certainly did \"back in the day\" (PS1/DC) -we ran without an allocator, just had dedicated pools for allocating actors and graphics resources. \nThe logic of the engine itself involved measuring available memory in a custom pool and throttling the scene (eg prioritizing objects to display). intead of trying to allocate and handling OOM. \nThis approach carried through to our streaming system on the xbox360. \n\nI recall an obscure bugs from with virtual memory interacting with runtime libraries creating graphics resources whilst decompression threads were consuming data after asynchronous loads. i think Gl implementations are usually general enough that you wouldn't run into this,but this was with the console customized apis.\n\n[2] The rust ideaof lightweight tasks does seem rather useful;\nExposing some control over how these tasks map to physical cores - perhaps being able to spawn tasks 1:1 with cores, manually (bypassing the scheduler) might be nice- gamedeveloppers do like to feel in control.\n\n[3]\nAnother idea that might be worth mentioning is control over the growable stacks;\n ithink there's been some discussion on that and I'm not entirely familiar with the details here;\n- currently there is a little overhead with function calls for checking if stacks overflow? \n  if you could disable this check/grow behaviour on a task by task basis that might put peoples' mind at rest on that front - also provide a 100% 1:1 mapping with what you get from a C compiler\n\n[3.1] Would it be possible to do something like the \"leaf-function\" idea inspired by how register saving wored on MIPS. \nLets say the stack was always reallocated with some fixed _over-estimate_, any _leaf function_ that is known to use less than this can omit any checks. I would hope this would allow the best of both worlds.. minimzing the overhead of the growable stack _and_ being safe- .\n\n[4] dont add exception handling :) rust already gets that right i think. Gamedevs usually use C++ with exceptions disabled. \nThis might be worth mentioning r.e. [3],[3.1] - the reason we _didnt_ use exception handling is we didn't like the idea of extra overhead on the stack associated with function calls- its possible hearing that \"stacks check to  reallocate\" might put some gamedeveloppers off.\n\n(now, Apologies if i'm rambling or diverging from the original question, the Runtime)\nOverall from my experience in game development the things that attracted me to rust generally are:-\n\n[1] the open-world replacement for classes - avoiding the problems of headers&classes in c++. better ability to decouple code whilst using the friendly a.foo(b) syntax with autocomplete and easy chaining.\nWe had terrible problems with this in C++ over the years especially as the company grew, merging work between source-bases.\nThis is where i get the desire for an option to impl for types in other crate when making exe's instead of libs.. with a warning instead of an error :)\n\n[2] the promise of a language better at (compile-time) reflection (serialization in particular) \nGame development is very _data driven_ . Getting between creation tools/export pipeline  & runtime is a big deal.\n\nremembering all the  hacks with  C x-macros or manually keeping serializes/deserializers/runtime representations in sync, or  generating debuug UI's etc. game engines frequently had their own hacks for getting around that and I always looked at c# with envy.\nmulti-item macros would be a great feature here,\n\n[3] the functional 'flavour' (const by default etc) - I became interested in this after experience parallelizing on the xbox360(ILP&SIMD, not just threads); \nit seemed the whole 'map/filter' mentality was highly applicable to the challenges there. \nI think the ideal would be to write code in a 'functional style' with iterators that expect pure functions/predicates which can then compile (if need be) what you wrote to patterns without branches, or turning decisions into SIMD masks or whatever... whilst not having to completely butcher your source like we did on those platforms . Now there's 8way simd, and gather instructions on intel..\nC++11 got lambdas about 5+ years too late for us. i've been encouraged by the way the chainable lazy iterators work in rust.\n\n[3.1]Even if you have \"enough processing power\", parallelizing can reduce _latency_.\n\n[4] the concurrency oriented memory model, seperate heaps per task, seems perfect. As a gamedevelopper i had never liked the idea of multiple threads poking into the same heap.\n",

While I'm not against this idea, I will say that game developers (especially in C++ land) often rely on some way of unwinding when things start going wrong. Of course, for a proper game, a fail!() is simply not going to cut it. Where I work, we use exceptions for this, since it's guaranteed that everything in scope will be destroyed (server connections, In-App-Purchase managerment, file handles, etc).

There's quite a bit of state to clean up between\nwhere we get that error and where we want to prompt the user that\nsomething bad just happened. Furthermore, we cross a couple app\nboundries between native C++ and, for example, Java code (where there's\nnot a very clear route 'back').\n\nIf this were Rust, I don't see a good way to guarantee everything is\nunwound properly. Do you?\n",
