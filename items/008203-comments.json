    "body": "@graydon: Upon thinking more about the ugly code in `with_argv` I'm no longer convinced that my replacement is safe. Specifically, `as_c_str` may actually copy the string if it's not null-terminated, and provide a pointer to that copied string. I suspect I may have to go ahead and use my new `into_owned()` so I can then use `as_bytes_with_null()` instead, although this will mean copying strings even if they were null-terminated to begin with.\n\nAlternatively I could reimplement `as_c_str()` but have it return `(Option<~str>, *libc::c_char)` instead, which would let me hold onto the temporary if one was constructed.\n\nThoughts?\n",

I could try refactoring those declarations to be outside the generic fn, but I have no way of test Windows short of going through the whole r+ -> full make check process again.\n",
