    "body": "@erickt If I'm understanding you correctly, the concern you have is addressed by using `emit_object(v, e)` rather than `v.encode(e)` for Objects in the implementation of Encodable for Json.  Because of that usage it's still possible to interact with json via rust maps, as long as the map is wrapped in Object before encoding.  This requires calling `someMap.to_json().encode(e)` rather than `someMap.encode(e)`, but beyond that I don't think there's any breaking changes here.\n\nIf the Encodable implementation for Json is changed/hidden as suggested in #9028 then that would become `someMap.to_json().to_writer(wr)`, but again this seems rather small, especially given the fact that we're currently producing invalid json...\n",

    "body": "@erickt:  I think there's still some misunderstanding on what this PR allows/prevents.  The short version of this mini-essay is that round-tripping works intuitively as long as you don't mix and match encode/decode mechanisms.\n\nAs long as values encoded using Encoder/PrettyEncoder are decoded using Decoder, and values encoded via the Json enum (so in most cases by using `to_json()`) are decoded using `json::from_str` (without Decoder), you'll be able to encode/decode just fine.\n\nTo steal your example:\n\n```\nlet mut map1: TreeMap<~str,~str> = TreeMap::new();\nmap1.insert(~\"k\", ~\"v\");\nmap1.insert(~\"foo\", ~\"bar\");\nlet encoded = do io::with_str_writer |wr| {\n    let mut encoder = json::Encoder(wr);\n    map1.encode(&mut encoder);\n};\nlet mut decoder = json::Decoder(json::from_str(encoded).unwrap());\nlet map2: TreeMap<~str, ~str> = Decodable::decode(&mut decoder);\n```\n\nThis works and results in `map1 == map2`. (It should also probably be a test...)  I will agree that the json it outputs (`{\"key0\":\"foo\",\"val0\":\"bar\",\"key1\":\"k\",\"val1\":\"v\"}`) is somewhat ugly.  However, if you need the output that is produced before this change (`{\"foo\":\"bar\", \"k\":\"v\"}`) then you can just use the `map1.to_json().encode(...)`.  Using `to_json()` would require slightly more work when decoding to convert from `json::Object` to a map (as Decoder would not work for the json produced), though it _might_ be possible to add helper methods for that.\n\nRegarding things being unintuitive: Mostly I'd be worried about someone encoding a map using Encoder and expecting `{\"foo\":\"bar\"...}` but getting `{\"key0\":\"foo\"...}`.  However, as long as values encoded using Encoder are decoded using Decoder, and values encoded using `Json.to_str()` (and similar) are decoded using `json::from_str` (without Decoder), the code will work, though the json may be overly complex.\n\nThe encoding/decoding implementation is fairly complex and is still possible to break (encode with Encoder, decode with just `json::from_str`, get a `json::Object` you probably don't expect).  Waiting for #9145 may indeed be warranted, but as I said I think there was (is?) misunderstanding on what exactly this allows/prevents.\n\n**TL;DR**: Round-tripping works intuitively as long as you don't mix and match encode/decode mechanisms.\n",

    "body": "Whoops, didn't intend to leave this sitting unattended for so long.\n\nIn any case, I'm not sure I want to re-open.  I feel like there's some doubt as to the efficacy of/need for this change.  As I mentioned in my last reply here, it does work, and round-tripping is in a functional state.  (Though, of course, it needs updating after several changes in other parts of the library.)  However, looking at it again, I feel like the need to not have data flow from ToJson to Decoder or from Encoder to FromJson could potentially be a sticking point.\n\nIf there's input saying that this change is wanted, then I'll happily jump back in and update it to match up with the latest rust, but without that input I feel I could better spend my time doing things like doc-fixing. (Which I haven't done enough of lately!)\n",
