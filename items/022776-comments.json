    "body": "I think the problem here is (the old) `byteorder`: `.as_ptr` only returns a pointer that is valid for as long as the slice it is called on, and the slice in the original code only lasts until the end of its `let` statement. Thus, the original code actually had a use-after-free bug.\n\nI'm closing since I don't think this is a bug in Rust, and thanks to @romanb for diagnosing and even fixing the problem in `byteorder`!\n",
