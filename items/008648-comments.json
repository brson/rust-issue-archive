    "body": "Let's please do this in a way that doesn't expose the `intrinsicness` of these functions, e.g. the docs shouldn't reveal that `cast::transmute` is actually a reexport of `unstable::intrinsics::transmute`. I guess this could be done by making `cast::transmute` a lang item that just decays into the transmute intrinsic during codegen. Then of course the actual \"rust-intrinsic\" intrinsic wouldn't need to exist, so maybe we'll end up with another class of intrinsics. We could also just make rustpkg not treat \"rust-intrinsic\" functions as special then declare the transmute intrinsic where `cast::transmute` is now. Would be nice to have standalone decls for that: `extern \"rust-intrinsic\" fn transmute(...);`.\n",
