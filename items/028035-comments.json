The bots also have very few environment variables set up for this, they basically just configure `PATH` so most things are there and everything works out OK.\n\nWhen you say you're running the latest windows cmake, where'd you install it from? Is it the `cmake` package in MSYS2? The `mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake` package? The CMake installer from their site?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Yes, the installer from the cmake site: http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.3/cmake-3.3.1-win32-x86.exe. The msys version of cmake cannot build for visual studio (by design). That's the reason I send commands via `cmd`, so it will look on the windows path for cmake rather than the msys path (it's not strictly necessary if the windows version is also on the msys path, but if you have both versions of cmake installed it means that you can set up PATH differently between msys and windows, so that the two versions don't conflict, and rust will automatically use the windows version)\n\nWhen I spoke to @retep998, he said that he also had manually run `vcvarsall.bat` before configuring.\n\nIf as you say the bots are configured so that they have most things on PATH already, couldn't that explain why it works? A normal VS installation will not add itself to PATH or modify environment variables, but whatever installs it on the bots may do things differently?\n",

    "body": "This is what I've discovered:\n- Running `./configure --build=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` from mingw64 terminal on a fresh checkout of master will succeed (but CFG_MSVC_INCLUDE_PATH_x/CFG_MSVC_LIB_PATH_x do not include the paths set by vcvarsall.bat, although that doesn't seem to matter)\n- Running the same command from bash running inside `cmd` will fail with `./configure: eval: line 1226: unexpected EOF while looking for matching \"'`, due to `cmd /c` getting path converted to `cmd C:\\`.\n- Running `cmd /c \"echo test\"` directly from mingw64 terminal will succeed (the `/c` is not converted)\n- Running `cmd /k \"echo test\"` in the same terminal will fail (the `/k` _is_ converted to `K:\\`)\n- Running `cmd /c \"echo test\"` from bash in cmd will fail\n- Running `cmd.exe /c \"echo test\"` from bash in cmd will succeed\n- Running `cmd.exe /k \"echo test\"` from bash in cmd will fail\n- Running `which cmd` and `which cmd.exe` show that they resolve to the same executable in all circumstances\n- In all cases, the conversion of `/c` to `C:\\` is done by the parent shell, before the child process is started.\n- Running `cmd` by its full unix-style path will always cause the `/c` to be converted, and fail.\n- Running `cmd` by its full windows-style path behaves exactly the same as just running `cmd` or `cmd.exe` depending on whether the extension is included.\n\nThe only conclusion I can come to is that bash/msys does some bizarre guessing game, based on the environment, the terminal, the filename, and the arguments passed in, to infer whether the command is a windows or a unix command. If it infers the latter, it converts the path.\n\nThe only saving grace is that using `//c` as I have done in this PR seems to work in all circumstances, regardless of how `cmd` is invoked.\n\nedit:\nOK, after getting a response on the msys IRC channel, I figured out what's going on (mostly):\n- Cygwin has a special exception for `cmd /c`: https://github.com/Alexpux/Cygwin/blob/msys2-master/winsup/cygwin/spawn.cc#L373-L374\n- It will only detect `cmd`, if either: 1) it's called as `cmd.exe` or 2) it's called as `cmd`, and `/usr/bin` is on PATH _before_ the windows path.\n- Running msys `make` from `cmd` directly is not supported - it must be executed via a bash login shell, which will set up PATH correctly.\n\nIt still seems like a bad idea to rely on the special casing of `cmd /c`, so most of this PR still stands, but it may not be necessary to run `vcvarsall.bat` before executing `cmake` - I'll experiment with that part more thoroughly tomorrow.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton There are four changes here (apart from `//c`):\n1) Calling `cmake` via `cmd`\nThis will make sure that the windows or mingw builds of `cmake` will be preferred over msys `cmake`. Without this, installing the `cmake` package in msys will break the build.\n\n2) Changes to how `include_path` and `lib_path` are set (specifically the addition of `//V:ON` and `\\&`).\nThese never worked as intended. Under some circumstances (as documented above) `vcvarsall.bat` _was_ successfully called. However, due to the way environment variables are substituted in `cmd` (http://ss64.com/nt/delayedexpansion.html), `include_path` and `lib_path` were expanded _before_ that happened. This didn't seem to break the build.\nAlso, `cmd` uses a single `&` rather than `&&` (this differs between command line vs batch file execution).\n\n3) Checking for `VisualStudioVersion` rather than `LIB` in `rustc_trans::back::msvc`\nThe purpose of this check is to determine whether `vcvarsall.bat` has already been run (as a way to allow the user to override which msvc version is used by rustc). Checking `VisualStudioVersion` is a more reliable way to do this, as the `LIB` environment variable is not guaranteed to be empty, even when `vcvarsall.bat` has not been called. (For example, some SDK installers will add to `LIB` and `INCLUDE` environment variables)\n\n4) Calling `vcvarsall.bat` directly before configuring `cmake`\nThis was necessary for to get it to build on my machine: I'm still in the process of determining why that was the case, and whether my setup was incorrect, or whether it will happen under unusual circumstances on valid setups.\n",

What's worse is that when it doesn't work it's very hard to track down what's really the problem, and even when you do, to fix it properly means breaking the configuration of other software you might have installed.\n",
