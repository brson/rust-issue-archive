Before this patch, all 16 bytes were returned successfully.\n\nThis is a problem because this sort of cast lunacy is used all over the place in the glibc/BSD sockets code, and libnative wraps this pretty faithfully. This causes the test failures since the `sockaddr`, `sockaddr_in`, `sockaddr_storage` structs are casted and created with this type of code, and once that is fixed (by avoiding casting), there are later failures which cause packet checksums to be wrong.\n\n<b>Edit:</b> replaced the test code to eliminate all the socket-related cruft.\n",

The difference is that it's non-idiomatic to return structures by value in C, so this is not a problem I've ever encountered (even when writing low-level socket code). IIRC for this sort of stuff out-pointers are the usual C idiom.\n\nI noticed this when trying to chase down the cause of the \"no-padding copies\" and finding myself surrounded by the faceless stares of LLVM intrinsics...so this gives weight to the \"change the TCP code\" strategy for fixing this :/.\n",

This lint would verify that structs marked `repr(C)` do not have any implicit padding in them.\n",
