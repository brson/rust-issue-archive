    "body": "Thanks for undertaking this @TeXitoi. Some thoughts on the process here:\n- All moco employees' work can be relicensed here without written permission\n- The most important thing is that we get written permission from the major authors\n- Agree we don't need permission from authors whose code no longer appears\n- Although we want permission from all authors, we can probably exercise some discretion for trivial changes if we can't round everybody up.\n- A lot of these authors will appear on multiple benchmarks, so get a blanket statement to relicense all of them\n\nFinally, please _email me_ the written statement from each, and I will file them somewhere. Please don't r+ this until I'm satisfied we're covered.\n",

I will put some time into this tomorrow to make sure I'm confident we've got a reasonable documentation trail, then I'll merge.\n\nI think comments on GitHub are good enough, but mostly because this is such a minor licensing issue that it hardly matters. If we were being more careful we would craft the exact statement we want them to say and tell them to copy and paste it into an email. A statement like the following is probably best:\n\n\"I agree to relicense any previous contributions to http://github.com/mozilla/rust according to the following terms:\n\n[complete license text]\"\n",
