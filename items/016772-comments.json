    "body": "Both `.as_ptr()` and `.as_mut_ptr()` are unsafe, so in principle, anything goes. But as far as I can see the use cases, `CString` is understood as an immutable wrapper, its main purpose being RAII over a foreign-allocated buffer while string modifications are preferably done elsewhere in Rust code. Perhaps there is no need for the crowbar that is `.as_mut_ptr()`, because one can always cast pointers explicitly in unsafe code and be aware of the implications.\n",
