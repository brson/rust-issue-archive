  "body": "Many changes to code structure are included:\n- removed TIME_SLICE_IN_MS\n- removed sychronized_indexed_list\n- removed region_owned\n- kernel_owned move to kernel.h, task_owned moved to task.h\n- global configs moved to rust_globals.h\n- changed #pragma once to standard guard in rust_upcall.h\n- got rid of memory.h\n- moved type stuff to rust_type.h\n- moved refcounting stuff to rust_refcount.h\n\n---\n\nSome things are still a bit weird, like the circular depencies between sched_loop and task, but I hope overall it's much more clean than before\n\nFixes #2083\n",
