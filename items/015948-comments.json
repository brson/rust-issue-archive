    "body": "I am inclined to say `find_slice()` is a sensible addition, but this is a very naive implementation. Unfortunately I'm not sure if there's a better way to search for arbitrary equatable elements. `find_str()` has a much better implementation but it relies on being able to search bytes. I'm not sure if the dependence on a `u8` value is actually critical to the implementation, but it's possible.\n\nFWIW `find_slice()` can be done in one line as\n\n``` rust\nlet i = haystack.windows(needle.len()).position(|v| v == needle);\n```\n\nNot that I'm saying that this is how it should be implemented, but I am saying that, as long as it's implemented with a naive solution, I'm not sure if there's actually a particularly compelling reason to have it. I'd much rather provide a solution that's more efficient than what people can trivially do on their own.\n",
