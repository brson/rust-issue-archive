    "body": "I think I've narrowed down the problem to the code in trans that handles class constructors, which created an 8-bit field within a 64-bit struct field and left three uninitialized bytes (plus, my dodgy shape code for resources wasn't properly skipping over that field (the \"drop field\"), and was comparing it instead of the actual pointer to the object). Working on a fix.\n\nFor future reference, the `--track-origins=yes` flag to `valgrind` will actually pinpoint where the uninitialized value was created. Wish I'd known that before I wasted hours barking up the wrong tree :-D\n",
