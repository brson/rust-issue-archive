    "body": "A bitmask of the right hand side would be the cheapest way to make the behavior defined.  It is what x86 does by default so it would be free there, it would just prevent LLVM from turning it into undef.  The behavior isn't very nice, but it's still way better than what we currently have, and if the current behavior is considered backwards compatible to change then so would this.\n\nAnother option would be to always turn the result into 0 (which I think most people expect when they do a long bit shift) wherever it went out of bounds.  I believe it would require a branch, though, but maybe there's a less expensive way to do it.  An assert would work too, it would be more expensive though.  The thing that gives me pause here is that (1) bitshifts are mostly used where performance is paramount, so having the default option be too expensive might not be good, and (2) bounds check removal is likely to be a lot more optimized in LLVM than overlong bitshift check removal (so the effect might be larger, plus we don't have an abstraction like iterators that would make them always defined).  OTOH, maybe nonconstant bitshifts are not that common.\n\nA third option would be to add the ability to make bitshift not undef to LLVM, but I suspect that doesn't really change the question of how best to do it, just moves the discussion to a different repository.  The biggest advantage to doing that would be that there wouldn't be additional overhead on --opt-level 0 (I'd imagine).\n\nAn unsafe (unchecked) version and a checked version would also be exposed, of course.\n",
