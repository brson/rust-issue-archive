    "body": "First of three PRs to push peripheral Unicode handling to crates outside of libstd.\n\nI believe this is the only one of the three forthcoming PRs that ends up touching functionality\nused in the compiler. Specifically, libsyntax and librustc_driver used `width()` for\npretty-printing. If this functionality is really necessary/desirable, we can either retain\n`width()` in std (presumably behind a deprecated gate encouraging others to use the\ncrates.io implementation, as with `rand`), or pull in unicode_width as a submodule. It\nseems a shame to leave a big character table in libunicode for a prettyprinting case\nthat will realistically almost never come up.\n",

    "body": "Awesome! Thanks!\n\nSome suggestions:\n- Could future crates be called `unicode-foo` instead of `unicode_foo`? Conventionally package names in crates.io have hyphens in them which are auto-translated to underscores in the crate name for the compiler.\n- Could this leave all the support for the functions around temporarily with a `#[deprecated]` tag? That should help ease the transition for users currently leveraging these functions. We should be able to delete all the support code soon hopefully!\n\nAlso cc @aturon, I'm a fan of this strategy but want to check with you as well!\n",
