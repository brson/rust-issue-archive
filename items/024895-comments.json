    "body": "To my mind, we should obviously fix the `dropck` implementation to check for methods properly.  (I have a patch that does this; that's how I actually found this problem -- because the regression test I added was also checking that it still accepts `Copy`, but of course it _shouldn't_, by the reasoning above.)\n\nThe remaining question is: Do we continue to have `Copy: Clone`?  Or does we remove that relationship, at least for the short term (i.e. remove it for the 1.0 release, with the expectation that we would put it back if we had some way of enforcing that the `Clone` implementation were in fact just the direct copy of the data).\n",

    "body": "Wow, that's surprising - I expected it to be illegal to have a type that is `Copy`, and has an explicit `clone`. I mean, is there any usecase for a type where the implicit copies performed by the compiler are different from the explicit copies created by calling `clone`? I would consider that very surprising, unexpected behavior. Not even C++ allows this: Either you overload the copy constructor, and it is used in all places, or you don't.\n",
