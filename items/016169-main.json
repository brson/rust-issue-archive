  "body": "<strike>Adds a simple/detailed toggle to api doc pages.\nDetailed mode is the current behaviour, simple mode hides all doccomment details leaving only signatures for quick browsing.\n</strike>\nAdds [expand all] and [collapse all] \"links\" to all api doc pages. All doccomments are collapsed, leaving only signatures for quick browsing.\n\nIn addition, clicking on a <strike>function name</strike> function's [toggle details] link now toggles the visibility of the associated doccomment.\n\n---\n# [Live Build Here](http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~abeinges/doc/std/vec/struct.Vec.html)\n\nThis is something that's been bothering me, and I've seen some people mention in IRC before. The docs are _great_ if you want a full in-depth look at an API, but _awful_ if you want to scan them. This provides the ability to toggle complexity freely. Interacts perfectly well with noscript, since the static page is effectively unchanged. Collapsing is just hiding divs with css.\n\nI'm not much of a designer, so design input welcome on the actual UX for toggling.\n\nThe actual javascript is _a bit_ brittle to layout changes, but it always will be without adding lots of extra junk to the actual markup, which didn't seem worth it.\n",
