    "body": "Thanks for the report! If you pass `--disable-docs` that just means that `make` won't build documentation by default, not that the documentation generator itself (rustdoc) won't be built. To prevent building standard build artifacts (e.g. those needed for a complete Rust installation) we could add another configure flag (e.g. --disable-rustdoc) or you'll need to tweak your `make` invocation.\n\nFor now though this is working as intended, so I'm going to close this.\n",
