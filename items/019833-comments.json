    "body": "The test case is I was using rust-bindgen to generate rust bindings from a C header and it was outputting `struct Struct_Foo {}` for the C code `struct Foo {};`. But by the sounds of it the bug is rust-bindgen generating incorrect ASTs for empty structs. I'll look into it some more then probably come back and close this.\n",
