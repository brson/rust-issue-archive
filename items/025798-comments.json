Adding undefined behavior probably isn't something we want to do to a core iterator adaptor, so we'll need to make a decision on this one way or another.\n\nThere's also the question about the `Step` trait and what to do about it. There have been a few small bugfixes recently to the `steps_between` calculation (handling negative steps), and it may not be 100% bullet-proof just yet.\n\nJust points to consider!\n",
