    "body": "I'm sorry, but I'm unhappy with most of this PR. :(\n- `rsplitn` should only require `ReverseSearcher`, not `DoubleEndedSearcher`.\n- It was intentional that the `where P::Searcher: Searcher<'a>` clauses can and are being omitted because of the inherent `P::Searcher` bound. The idea is to make the \"simple\" signatures of the basic string operations not too complex by having all these bounds everywhere, by adding the reasonable constrain that any pattern should least provide a regular forward searcher. Of course, that only works for methods returning iterators and non-iterator returning methods that don't also require `ReverseSearcher` or `DoubleEndedSearcher`.\n- If we would add those \"early\" `where` clauses, then the inherent bound on `Pattern::Searcher` should be removed to remove redundancy, and to make the API consistent. As the patch is right now, its weird that `rsplitn()` has a needed bound, `splitn()` has a redundant bound, and `split()` has no bounds.\n- However, those early `where` bounds on `splitn()` and `rsplitn()` only really work for those two methods because there the generic bounds only have one valid option each: `P::Search: Searcher -> SplitN: Iterator` and `P::Searcher: ReverseSearcher -> RSplitN: Iterator`. It doesn't work for the general cases like `split`, because there its both `P::Search: Searcher -> Split: Iterator` and `P::Search: DoubleEndedSearcher -> Split: DoubleEndedIterator`.\n- So even if we add the early where clauses to improve error messages, they should not be added for methods returning iterators because it would make their API inconsistent. You could make the case for having the bounds on all impls and non-iterator returning methods though.\n\nSo, in summary I'd be fine with a fix to make `RSplitN<'a, P>` work with `P::Searcher: ReverseSearcher` and `SplitN<'a, P>` without `P::Searcher: DoubleEndedSearcher`, but I think the other changes at least warrant a separate discussion and/or PR.\n\nI'd much rather see the compiler solve the error message problem in a general way, eg by deeply searching for the cause of why a trait might not be implemented:\n\n```\n<anon>:14         \"foo\".split(\"o\").rev().collect::<Vec<_>>()\n                                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nerror: type `core::iter::Rev<core::str::Split<'_, &str>>` does not implement any method in scope named `collect`\nnote: Possible trait that provides `collect`: `core::iter::Iterator`.\nnote: `core::iter::Rev<core::str::Split<'_, &str>>` would implement `core::iter::Iterator` if\n      `core::str::Split<'_, &str>` would implement `core::iter::DoubleEndedIterator`\nnote: `core::str::Split<'_, &str>` would implement `core::iter::DoubleEndedIterator` if\n      `<&str as Pattern<'_>>::Searcher` would implement `core::str::DoubleEndedSearcher`\nnote: `<&str as Pattern<'_>>::Searcher` does not implement `core::str::DoubleEndedSearcher`\n```\n",

    "body": "@sfackler: ~~The signature would not be incorrect - it returns a type that conditionally implements iterator based on whether the pattern has some properties like supporting a reverse searcher.~~\n\n~~I agree that if we would just be talking about `rsplitn` in isolation, it would be less confusing to just add the bound up front. But you can not do that for something like the DoubleEndedIterator impl of `split`, so it makes sense to me to treat them consistently in that regard.~~\n\nThat said, while writing this I changed mind: I just realized that we can preserve consistency by treating DoubleEndedIterator impls and reverse iterators differently, but uniformly so.\n- Reverse iterators can only work with a ReverseSearcher bound, so having the bound on the method can be done for all of them and does not restrict their usage. \n- Independent from that, both forward and reverse iterators would conditionally implement DoubleEndedIterator without it being obvious from the method signature, which is consistent to other APIs.\n\n... and this, apparently is also how @shepmaster interpreted the situation, so yeah, patch looks good!\n\nTests should definitely be added, but I wouldn't fuss too much about code layout and the code duplication introduced here: I've started working on a patch that adds the missing methods from the string pattern RFC, which also includes the changes here, and in which I try to reduce the general complexity of forward/backward iterator wrappers with a more specialized macro that generates them.  \n\nNot sure when that will be done though, so I'd definitely try to get this PR merged first.\n",
