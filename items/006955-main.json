This patch makes no\nassumptions about the same author using different email addresses, and\nonly collects cases where the full-name of the person is spelt\ndifferently for the same email address.  Verify with:\n\n  $ git shortlog -se | cut -f 2 | cut -d< -f 2 | sort | uniq -d\n\nIt only assumes that the author prefers the full-name that appears\ndominantly, by number of contributions.\n\nFor the purposes of merging, a strictly alphabetical ordering is\nadvised.  See MAPPING AUTHORS section of git-shortlog(1) to understand\nthe format of this file.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ramkumar Ramachandra artagnon@gmail.com\n",
