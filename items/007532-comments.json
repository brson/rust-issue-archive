You can either just ask on the channel, or specifically ask one of the people with an @ in front of their nickname (those are the core team members), or ask cmr, who left several comments above. I'm probably not going to be on IRC much today, but you can ask me as well, tomorrow (my IRC nick is tjc).\n",
