  "body": "This factors out the install.sh file used by both Cargo and Rust in anticipation of creating a single combined installer for both, per https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/16456.\n\nThere should be no changes in functionality.\n\nThe installation script has been moved to [a new shared project](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-installer).\n\nThe impacts to Rust are:\n- When running `make install` or `make dist`, `rust-installer` itself does yet-another copy of the installation image during its prep.\n- When running `make install` the tarball is built as a side-effect, though it isn't used.\n\nWe might want to wait a week to land this since I will be OOTO from Wednesday through Sunday and unable to deal with fallout.\n",
