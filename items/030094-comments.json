    "body": "Based on the discussion in that PR, it seems like introducing such a change would be too controversial and will cause some existing doctests to stop being executed (by default). I do agree that such doctests are not useful to write, but introducing such a change is basically like breaking existing code - even though we're not causing something to fail that wasn't, we'd be stopping tests from executing that were being run before. Since that behavior has been in place all this time (the original issue was filed almost three years ago!), it's basically too entrenched to give up. I'm closing this issue in light of this.",
