After all this lands, follow-up commits can fix the whitespace (perhaps at the same time that they put in other transformations like replacing cases of `Visitor<Env>{ ... }` with `Visitor<()> { e: Env, ... }`).\n\nBut for these immediate pull requests, I wanted to ensure that these changes kept their nature as refactorings as obvious as possible.\n",
