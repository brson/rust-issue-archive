This represents a decision to move away from parametricity; we started down this road when accepting the [specialization RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210) (where there was much discussion). This is also relevant to `mem::discriminant` (rust-lang/rfcs#1696).\n\n**Note:** This final-comment-period lasts for (roughly) the current release cycle, which began on Aug 18, 2016.\n",

    "body": "On the general topic of parametricity, there have been numerous comments. In an effort to summarize the conversation, I wanted to link to some of the most salient exchanges:\n- The `Reflect` bound was being used for the `discriminant_value` intrinsic (#24263) and was removed for the proposed `mem::discriminant` alternative (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1696):\n  - the bound existed because \"discriminant-value\" allowed one to extract information (the index of the variant) not normally available from a value of type `T` (where `T` is a type parameter), as [explained by @glaebhoerl here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1696#issuecomment-236669066)\n  - also in that same comment, @glaebhoerl explains that because specialization is not yet stable, it would perhaps be \"improper\" to consider parametricity removed. (I [was sympathetic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1696#issuecomment-236982368) to this POV, and hence the decision to initiate a formal decision to remove `Reflect`.)\n- The specialization RFC was where most discussion about parametricity took place. \n  - @glaebhoerl [began the discussion](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-179898277), arguing that parametricity \"is one of the most important guarantees for writing code whose behavior is easy to understand and refactor\".\n  - @aturon highlighted the [inherent tension](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-179984798) between parametricity and zero-cost abstractions ([summarized again here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-179994147)).\n  - @glaebhoerl counters that one can [make specialization \"unsafe\"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-180674876), requiring that violations of parametricity do not change \"observable behavior\", in order to support both parametricity and zero-cost abstractions\n  - @aturon argues that [parametricity is not as important in practice as is widely believed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-181969196), showing the relatively few places that is it required in Haskell, and further argues that making parametricity into a matter of `unsafe` would be very difficult to formalize and is likely to be widely misunderstood and misapplied.\n  - I argue that parametricity [prohibits useful patterns and that privacy can give you the same kinds of guarantees](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-181992044), but in a more robust way.\n    - @bluss [cites an example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-182043281) where the Go language used reflection to violate parametricity in a way that they have come to regret. The [takeaway](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-182062204) is that one should violate parametricity with care (something with which the [Go developers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-182068949) agree), but not necessarily that one should abandon specialization altogether.\n    - @glaebhoerl argues that [confusion over the formal meaning of parametricity is not found in Haskell](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-186008829). [@aturon responds here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-186443287) to many of the particular point.\n    - I propose a way to extend Rust in the future with [\"opt-in\" parametricity](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-186429434) if we should ever find we want it.\n  - (Much of this is covered in the [final comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-187777838) here as well.)\n",

    "body": "@withoutboats In a nutshell, it means that Rust will not attempt to ensure traditional parametricity for type arguments (i.e. that generic code behaves \"equivalently\" when instantiated with different types). This is already formally the case due to the ability to get the size of a type parameter, but we're opening the door to observable, behavioral differences under different type arguments.\n\nThat means we will permit language features that let you write a function like:\n\n``` rust\nfn print<T>(t: &T) { ... }\n```\n\nwhich e.g. prints its argument using `Display` if available, otherwise `Debug` if available, otherwise prints a generic message. Whereas in today's Rust, you might assume that such a function must behave more \"uniformly\" for all `T` (and in fact that it couldn't interact meaningfully with its argument).\n\nThe tradeoff is:\n- **Benefit**: additional expressiveness, of course. In particular, in the specialization thread I and others argued that this kind of \"static reflection\" is essential for reaching true zero-cost abstraction. A possible counter-argument: it could be treated as an unsafe feature, where marking as safe requires ensuring that there's no \"observable\" difference in behavior, just better performance. But of course there are use cases like `print` above where different behavior is the whole point. See the specialization thread for more.\n- **Downside**: the signature of a function tells you less about that function's behavior. That is, you can make certain assumptions about a signature like `print` in Rust today, e.g. that it cannot access anything \"inside\" its argument -- and that reasoning would be invalidated. Counter-argument: in almost all cases you need a contract for a function that goes beyond what the types say anyway; if this kind of lack of reflection is important, just make it an explicit part of the function's contract. In particular, the vast majority of generic functions will still behave parametrically, and those that don't are likely to be fairly obvious or otherwise marked.\n\nNote that all of the above is specific to _type_ parameters. _Lifetime_ parameters, on the other hand, are intended to remain parametric -- e.g. you can't change the behavior of your function depending on whether a given lifetime is `'static` or not. That's important for functions like [`Ref::map`](https://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/cell/struct.Ref.html#method.map).\n",

    "body": "> That means we will permit language features that let you write a function ... which e.g. prints its argument using Display if available, otherwise Debug if available, otherwise prints a generic message.\n\nIn my opinion, strict parametricity is not so important, but explicit, algorithmic reflection almost always is a band-aid over a wrong abstraction which results in increasingly unmaintainable spaghetti. Having automatically determined aparametricity during monomorphization (so specialization) is fine, in my opinion, but making explicit downcasting a normal and commonly used part of the language would be a very negative change. The fact that its so hard to do this is one of the language's key selling points to me.\n\nThat is, I'm comfortable with this:\n\n``` rust\ndefault fn print<T>(t: &T) { ... }\ndefault fn print<T: Debug>(t: &T) { ... }\ndefault fn print<T: Display>(t: &T) { ... }\nfn print<T: Debug + Display>(t: &T) { ... }\n```\n\nBut I'm uncomfortable with something like this:\n\n``` rust\nfn print<T>(t: &T) {\n    if T::implements::<Display>() { ... }\n    else if T::implements::<Debug>() { ... }\n    else { ... }\n} \n```\n\nPartly this is an intuitive judgment, but some obvious advantages of the first:\n1. The compiler can automatically check your specialization hierarchy - you have to think explicitly about \"what if `T: Debug + Display`?\" and \"what if `T: !Debug + !Display`?\" or your code won't compile.\n2. No conditional thickets.\n",

While that's true, the _intent_ was actually to retain some form of \"strict\" parametricity, by forcing you to signal when even \"static reflection\" was occurring.\n\nSo we've been talking about this in terms of strict parametricity, but we should perhaps think about its implications for encouraging downcasting.\n\nGiven the way the setup currently works, I don't actually think the `Reflect` trait provides much of a speedbump for using downcasting. Basically all concrete types are automatically `Reflect` anyway. So this just acts as a signal that you're doing something connected with reflection (static or dynamic) and generic type parameters. In practice, people end up bounding by `Any` anyway.\n",

    "body": "@durka There's a proposed extension to specialization that would make it work, what @aturon referred to as 'lattice impls,' which would allow you to have diamond specializations like this as long as you've completely accounted for the area of overlap with a _more specialized_ impl.\n\nThat extension seems fine to me - as long as you are forced to make an explicit decision about every possible case, specialization should be as flexible as possible. The problem with something like downcasting is that you aren't required to think about the case, so if you don't think about it the answer depends on the order you wrote the conditionals in.\n\nThat is, I don't like that these two implementations behave differently. I think that polymorphism should be code order independent. (existing `Any` downcasting doesn't have this problem because Rust doesn't have subtyping between `'static` types).\n\n``` rust\nfn print<T>(t: &T) {\n    if T::implements::<Display>() { ... }\n    else if T::implements::<Debug>() { ... }\n    else { ... }\n} \n```\n\n``` rust\nfn print<T>(t: &T) {\n    if T::implements::<Debug>() { ... }\n    else if T::implements::<Display>() { ... }\n    else { ... }\n} \n```\n",

Or, more explicitly, I tend to prefer downcasting when it is used with other features that encourage exhaustive handling (e.g., a `match` statement downcasts an enum, but it requires you to write a `_` case; same with specialization, which requires you to write what happens for all `T`). Ultimately this doesn't stop people from writing fragile code of course, but I find it a helpful reminder (also during code reviews). (I'm not keen on the overuse of `if let` for similar reasons, since I view that as effectively a non-exhaustive downcast.)\n",

This discussion of introducing typecase puzzles me, particularly because Rust already supports ad-hoc overloading via traits, so why introduce yet another way to overload, and via a mechanism that is more limited to boot, ie. typecase is closed where traits are open?\n\nWith impl specialization seemingly merged, zero-cost open overloading already seems available, so what's the real use for typecase, aside from reducing a little typing by avoiding trait and impls?\n",
