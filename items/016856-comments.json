I wouldn't be surprised if my machine is doing something wrong but I'm at a loss as to what.\n\nFor reference, this is the clang version that's building Rust:\n\n```\n] clang -v\nApple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin13.3.0\nThread model: posix\n```\n",
