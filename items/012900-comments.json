    "body": "Awesome, finally the API gets in a mostly sensible shape.\n\nOnly thing that seems really objectionable is putting \"condvar\" inside MutexGuard, since most mutexes won't need condvars, and tying them is really inflexible (e.g. can't put them in a HashMap<~str, Condvar> but only a static array inside the mutex itself).\n\nI think condvars need to be split from mutexes, take a guard parameter, and check at runtime that the guard is from the correct lock.\n\nAlso, naming seems debatable: maybe Mutex<T> and RWLock<T> should be renamed to something like SyncCell<T> and RwSyncCell<T> or perhaps just Sync<T> and RwSync<T>?\n\nThe current naming scheme in this pull request is akin to calling RefCell<T> BorrowFlags<T> instead.\n",
