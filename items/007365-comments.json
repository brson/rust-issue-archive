    "body": "Eek! I'm sorry, I didn't see you working on this. I started working on a higher-efficiency interner a while back already, just never cleaned it up. It keeps all the strings in one buffer, so no separate-allocations overhead. http://people.mozilla.org/~graydon/interner.rs\n\n(I think we might also consider shifting to a model wherein all strings are \"interned\" as slices from file buffers, not (re)allocated strings at all, but that's another matter. It's how many other compilers work.)\n",
