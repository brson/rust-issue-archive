I have not been able to produce one, although I do have a test that uses the `#[fixed_stack_segment]` annotation to ensure a stack switch when returning a double. This leads me to think that while we are technically violating the cdecl ABI, it may in fact be harmless for doubles (though I thought I saw errors that seems to be specifically caused by the floating point stack being corrupted, so maybe I just haven't found the right code path to trigger an error).\n",
