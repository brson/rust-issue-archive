I suppose we could batch the commands on windows instead of doing it all in one go. \n\nIf you feel like going whole-hog on this issue, I know that LLVM has an `llvm-ar` tool which is in theory a replacement for `ar`. This also means that they should have all the library support in LLVM proper to write all of this without invoking an external `ar` tool, but that's also dreaming a bit!\n",

    "body": "I've modified `ArchiveBuilder::build` to use multiple `ar` invocations when the total length of the argument list would exceed 32k (the limit on Windows).   I also made it run `ar` out of the temp directory, using just the filename instead of the absolute path for each archive member, which on its own is sufficient to get `rustc_llvm`'s `ar` command under 32k.\n\nI looked at `llvm-ar`, but the archive-writing code is in `llvm-ar.cpp`, not a library.  The format is pretty simple, so it wouldn't be that hard to write a pure-Rust archive writer, but there are also some annoying details regarding GNU format vs. BSD format archives, and I figured it was best to leave that for the system binutils to sort out.\n",

    "body": "I've fixed the error on OSX by changing how the rlib symbol index is updated on that platform.  Previously, `link_rlib` produced rlibs that were unusable because they did not contain a symbol index at all (`update_symbols` was never run).  The simple fix (always run `update_symbols`) doesn't work because `ar` apparently still has trouble dealing with non-object files when producing a symbol table.  So `link_rlib` now makes two `ar` invocations: one to add all object files and update symbols, and a second to add non-object files (metadata and bitcode) without updating symbols.  (`link_staticlib` may make a third invocation if there are more objects to add.)\n\nOn non-OSX platforms, `link_rlib`/`link_staticlib` still uses a single `ar` invocation to add all object and non-object members and generate symbols.\n",
