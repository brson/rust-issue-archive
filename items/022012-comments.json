    "body": "Are we going to miss this? I have a branch which removes this facility. The root problem is that we do object conversions differently depending on if we are using coercion or casting. My branch removes the cast code path completely so `x as Box<Foo>` is essentially compiled as `(x: Box<Foo>) as Box<Foo>`. The solution is to re-implement this patch for coercions, but I'm not sure if that is possible because coercions are a little less 'directed' by the types involved.\n",

(I guess I should have maybe put in some tests to ensure this did not get regressed.)\n\nIn other words, make sure that this [playpen](http://is.gd/cuJPL7) does not stop working, and I'll be happy.\n",
