    "body": "Hm true. In general I've been very worried in the past about this form of `deriving` as it seems like a footgun for various forms of configuration of `deriving`. For example it looks like instances of `derive(Eq)` with a manual `PartialEq` impl were removed in favor of a manual `Eq` impl. I worry about the \"half-`derive`\" case, but it may not be too large of a worry in practice. For example adding an impl of `Eq` is just a marker trait so it's not so bad, and I'm not sure how much this applies to `Ord` and `PartialOrd`...\n",

There's a big cliff between:\n\n``` rust\n#[derive(Ord)]\nstruct Foo { ... }\n```\n\nand\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo { ... }\n\nimpl Ord for Foo {\n    fn cmp(&self, other: &Foo) -> Ordering {\n        // ... lots of stuff ...\n    }\n}\nimpl PartialOrd for Foo {\n     fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Foo) -> Option<Ordering> { Some(self.cmp(other)) }\n     fn lt(&self, other: &Foo) -> bool { /* supafast */ }\n}\n```\n\nThat said, it seems like this PR is the right default, and we can add an opt-out mechanism in future.\n",
