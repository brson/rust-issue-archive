  "body": "Even when optimized, something like vec![1i,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] will\nallocate three times, because LLVM can only drop the call based on the\nobserved size of the previous allocation. Using a simple macro to count\nthe number of elements, we can initialize the vector with the correct\nsize and avoid reallocations.\n\nSince LLVM already does constant folding for us, the new count!() macro\nresults in a single integer constant even if building without\noptimizations, so we don't end up with an awful lot of additions in the\ngenerated code.\n",
