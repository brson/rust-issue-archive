You could make a private `std::io::raw_net` module for testing this and use the `iotest!` macro if you'd like.\n\nSome tests you may want to write:\n- send/receive smoke tests\n- clone() and concurrent send/receive\n- clone() and concurrent drops\n\nYou'll want to be pretty careful with the tests because there's not a whole lot of error handling here so the tests are susceptible to EINTR or possibly EAGAIN spuriously\n",
