  "body": "This pull request completely rewrites std::comm and all associated users. Some major bullet points\n- Everything now works natively\n- oneshots have been removed\n- shared ports have been removed\n- try_recv no longer blocks (recv_opt blocks)\n- constructors are now Chan::new and SharedChan::new\n- failure is propagated on send\n- stream channels are 3x faster\n\nI have acquired the following measurements on this patch. I compared against Go, but remember that Go's channels are fundamentally different than ours in that sends are by-default blocking. This means that it's not really a totally fair comparison, but it's good to see ballpark numbers for anyway\n\n```\n          oneshot         stream          shared1\nstd         2.111           3.073          1.730 \nmy          6.639           1.037          1.238 \nnative      5.748           1.017          1.250 \ngo8         1.774           3.575          2.948 \ngo8-inf     slow            0.837          1.376 \ngo8-128     4.832           1.430          1.504 \ngo1         1.528           1.439          1.251 \ngo2         1.753           3.845          3.166 \n```\n\nI had three benchmarks:\n- oneshot - N times, create a \"oneshot channel\", send on it, then receive on it (no task spawning)\n- stream - N times, send from one task to another task, wait for both to complete\n- shared1 - create N threads, each of which sends M times, and a port receives N*M times.\n\nThe rows are as follows:\n- `std` - the current libstd implementation (before this pull request)\n- `my` - this pull request's implementation (in M:N mode)\n- `native` - this pull request's implementation (in 1:1 mode)\n- `goN` - go's implementation with GOMAXPROCS=N. The only relevant value is 8 (I had 8 cores on this machine)\n- `goN-X` - go's implementation where the channels in question were created with buffers of size `X` to behave more similarly to rust's channels.\n",
