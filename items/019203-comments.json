    "body": "I don\u2019t think that the parenthesised part of the message should have backticks around _all_ of it. In quite a lot of cases, the parenthesised part refers to something like an \u2018integral variable\u2019 (e.g., the message from `let x: Box<int> = 1;`), and should not be surrounded by backticks, as it does not represent code. Even something like \u2018enum std::option::Option\u2019 shouldn\u2019t have backticks around the whole message; the actual code part is the \u2018std::option::Option\u2019 part, so that alone should have backticks around it. Making that change should be as simple as modifying [`rustc::middle::ty::ty_sort_string`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/770378a313a573776b16237a46b75bafa49072c1/src/librustc/middle/ty.rs#L4039) to put backticks around the path of any enum, struct, or trait.\n\nI also suspect that some tests may be affected by this change (and stop passing). Have you run `make check` on these changes? I suspect that, since this is the first multi-line error message in Rust, that `compiletest` will have to be updated to recognise that messages can span multiple lines.\n",

See how with the second, it is straightforward to see where the only difference lies.

    "body": "It\u2019s sad to see this pull request closed. I\u2019ve wanted multi-line error messages (particularly this \u2018mismatched types\u2019 one) for quite some time now, and I know I\u2019m not the only one who does. It is true that long type names don\u2019t play well with word wrapping, but that\u2019s true for the current error messages as well. I believe that multi-line error messages would significantly improve readability of long type names, if done properly. Compare:\n\n```\n<anon>:2:5: 2:10 error: mismatched types:\n    expected: `core::option::Option<SomeReallyLongTypeNameWith<Lots, Of, Generic, Parameters, Too>>`\n    found:    `core::option::Result<SomeReallyLongTypeNameWith<Lots, Of, Generic, Parameters, Too>, SomeOtherType>`\n    (expected enum `core::option::Option`, found enum `core::result::Result`)\n```\n\nAnd:\n\n```\n<anon>:2:5: 2:10 error: mismatched types: expected `core::option::Option<SomeReallyLongTypeNameWith<Lots, Of, Generic, Parameters, Too>>`, found core::option::Result<SomeReallyLongTypeNameWith<Lots, Of, Generic, Parameters, Too>, SomeOtherType>` (expected enum `core::option::Option`, found enum `core::result::Result`)\n```\n\nWith or without word wrap, the former is _much_ easier to read. I honestly don\u2019t see what word wrap has to do with the argument.\n\n---\n\n(An extra compiler flag shouldn\u2019t require an RFC. RFCs are only for language and major library changes: the compiler frontend is unrelated to either of those two.)\n",
