    "body": "Ok, since I've been working with this stuff already, I took a moment to investigate:\n\nFor the first two errors, those are issues with `check_match`, unsurprisingly.\n\nFor the third error, the issue is due to an inconsistency between how the `&<pat>` pattern handles DSTs and how `ref ident` expects DST values to be given to it, so `& ref ident` has the outer pattern passing along a different value to the one the inner inner pattern expects, yay! I fixed one case in #30245, but not the one you're hitting here.\n\nThe last error is the most complex as it's a weird case of `struct Test([i32])` being a perfectly valid type, but `fn([i32]) -> Test` not being a valid function. We probably need to check whether you're forcing the creation of an invalid function and error somewhere earlier. That's where the error comes from, btw, the creation of the `fn Test(_0: [i32]) -> Test { ... }` function body.\n",
