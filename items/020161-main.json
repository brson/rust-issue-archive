This was done to reduce morestack thrashing.\nHowever, since we do not have segmented stacks any more, this is not\nnecessary and the issues mentioned in the comment apply more strongly.\n\nDefer the load until we actually need it, as it was causing LLVM to miss\nsome obvious optimisations.\n\nFixes #20149\n",
