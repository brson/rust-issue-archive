    "body": "@pnkfelix It is a bit hard to say, precisely because the old code was not well-behaved. I can however surely say that this does not change the intention (say, it doesn't make `{:e}` to print decimals only). More precisely, I _think_ that exact changes are as follows:\n- When the precision is not given, all specifiers default to the shortest representation.\n- When the precision is given, all specifiers round precisely based on the exact (not shortest) decimal expansion. Unit tests have some examples, but namely, the exact value of `0.95f64` is slightly smaller than 0.95 and `format!(\"{:.1}\", 0.95f64)` will give `\"0.9\"` instead of `\"1.0\"`.\n- Given the enough precision (more than 800 fractional digits) it will (correctly) print trailling zeroes.\n- NaN is unsigned, i.e. `format!(\"{:+?}\", 0.0/0.0)` is simply `\"NaN\"`. (Previously it gave `\"+NaN\"`.)\n\nEdit 2015-04-22: I've changed the implementation so that it preserves the original behavior as much as possible. The changes specific to the original code (but subsequently reverted in this PR) are as follows:\n- For `{}` and `{:?}`, large (>=10^16) or small (<10^-4) value will rendered in the exponential notation.\n- Every letter inside the formatted number (`e`, `inf`, `nan`) is lowercased except for `{:E}` where it is uppercased instead. (Previously `inf` was always lowercased and `NaN` was always mixed-cased.)\n\nRegarding the existing discussions, with an exception of the sign of `nan`, it behaves identically as before. It is easy to switch the behavior (e.g. in order to get a trailing `.0`, use `frac_digits` of 1), so I'm not too worried.\n",

Maybe we can go ahead and change this without going through an RFC.\n",

    "body": "FWIW, the `%g`-like format is the default in many languages -- probably because it's non-lossy, concise, and convenient for values near zero in magnitude.  It _is_ awkward that it can take either of two different forms, though, and perhaps it's too late.  I think the precision field for `%g` typically controls the total number of digits (before and after the decimal point).\n",
