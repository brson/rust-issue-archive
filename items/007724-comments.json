It went something like this:\n\n```\nuse std::libc::c_void;\n\npub type Foo = c_void;\n\n#[deriving(Clone)]\nstruct Bar {\n  priv foo: *Foo,\n}\n```\n\nMaybe this is just a missing Clone impl for raw pointers. Or perhaps this pattern is specifically not supported. I didn't have time to look but figured I'd update this bug.\n",
