    "body": "This is actually currently intended behavior because you need to install the target Rust libraries (e.g. the standard library) before you're able to cross compile for new targets. For example any old rust compiler can't automatically succeed when targeting all the platforms Rust supports.\n\nWe're working on bolstering up the installation scripts (e.g. rustup) to allow much easier installation of these libraries, but in the meantime [you can manually install the target libraries](https://github.com/alexcrichton/gcc-rs/blob/e76ff5f3dcf36b798fa4997da40ae392ab543f76/.travis.yml#L8-L14).\n\nAs this is intended behavior, however, I'm going to close this.\n",
