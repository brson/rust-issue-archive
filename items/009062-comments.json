I'd be a little in favor of replacing `Permutations::new` to avoid confusion if that were the case. Alternatively we could even have `v.permutations()` where it's a method on vectors as well. What do you think?\n\nI was also thinking we could make `vec::unzip` an iterator method instead of tying it to vectors, but that doesn't _quite_ make sense to me, so nevermind.\n",
