    "body": "Some comments:\n- In general we want the `io::native` modules to present an interface that is compatible with the non-blocking interface, so that `std::io` can multiplex between them based on the execution context.\n- `read_line` should probably be done as part of the general 'encoding' subsystem that doesn't exist yet. That said, this function is pretty critical for porting `std::io` users, so we can live with this for now.\n\nI'm not sure whether it should only be defined for `BufferedReader` or just on `ReaderUtil`. My inclination is that it should probably be available on all readers.\n",
