    "body": "Just a random idea, how about having traits like `BigO_n`, `BigO_logn` and implement them by container structures just for the purpose of documentation. This would make it easy to show all structures that are O(n) in the documentation just by clicking on BigO_n. Ok, it's not that easy, as we'd need traits for every operation, like `Insert_BigO_n` and `Lookup_BigO_logn`. There could also be different traits for space usage and time.\n",

Not sure if this is useful at all. Much more useful I find the aspect of documentation. I.e. clicking on the `LogN` trait shows me all algorithms and data structures that operate in `LogN`. I agree that it would be mostly a nasty abuse... :). The good thing you wouldn't have to change rustdoc in any way and \"document\" performance aspects, nor have to implement a new annotation. \n\n```\nimpl<A> Insert_LogN for LinkedList<A> {}\nimpl<A> Find_LogN for LinkedList<A> {}\nimpl<K, V> Insert_LogN for HashMap<K, V> {}\n```\n\nYour annotation approach is of course more general. \n",

    "body": "This was written before I knew we were considering dropping traits for the time being. I had envisioned this providing basic context, with the actual traits providing a summary of their implementers. I think it would probably be more suitable as a separate standalone guide that is linked to by this page (and perhaps others).\n\nI'll work on hacking this out into something more generic, and then start on something more direct for collections. I guess this should be closed?\n\nfwiw I also wrote this to test the waters on how people overall felt about including formal and informal performance discussions in the docs (overall reaction: positive).\n",
