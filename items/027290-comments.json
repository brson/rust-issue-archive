At least I get the same error message.\n\nI tried to follow your instructions at #24777, but stumbled upon an issue:\n\n> Clone and build LLVM's libcxxabi library. Only the libunwind.a artifact is needed. I have tried using upstream libunwind's source repo but I have not gotten unwinding to work with it unfortunately. Move libunwind.a adjacent to MUSL's libc.a\n\nI followed the instruction of libcxxabi, but got no libunwind.a at all (tried with trunk and the 3.6.2 release tag from svn).\nSo I went for the [libunwind by pathscale](https://github.com/pathscale/libunwind) and got the artifact.\nBut building rust with this in place results in the error mentioned above.\n\nYou can find my build steps at https://gist.github.com/asaaki/e15fb009ba4b40611d78\n\nWould be awesome if you could provide more detailed instructions on how to reproduce a successful build.\n",
