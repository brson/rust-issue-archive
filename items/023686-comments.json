    "body": "This looks the same as https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18082#issuecomment-59311096\n\n> it's just that the definitions of \"unused\" and \"private\" are a bit fuzzy with this example.\n\nThis [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0136-no-privates-in-public.md#when-is-an-item-public) states: \"Items that are explicitly declared as pub are always public\". Per the RFC, the `Alpha` struct is public, therefore it's correct for it to appear in the return type of `yeah`. `Alpha` also happens to be, what I call, an \"inaccesible\" item because it's inside a private module that downstream crates can't `use`/reference/name.\n\nNot sure what the behavior should be in this case:\n- `yeah().value()` should just work, i.e. the inaccessible `Alpha::value` symbol should be exported in the upstream rlib, even though it's not visible in the upstream docs and is not `#[doc(hidden)]`.\n- `yeah().value()` should not compile, and error with \"type `Alpha` does not implement any method in scope named `value`\". Which begs the question, what can you do with the return value of `yeah()`?\n- Forbid putting \"inaccessible\" items in public signatures, i.e. the upstream crate should fail to compile the `yeah` function. (FWIW, I prefer this option)\n\ncc @pnkfelix @nrc @alexcrichton\n",

    "body": "This code is valid, and it's a compiler bug that the link error is coming up. As @japaric noted, the `Alpha` struct is considered public because it's marked `pub`, and then the compiler's analysis is falling down by not detecting that the `value` function is indeed reachable and needs to be a public symbol.\n\nThe link error is covered by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/16734, so I'm going to close in favor of that. Thanks for the report though!\n",
