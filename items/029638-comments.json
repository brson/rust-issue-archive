    "body": "Some serious bugs and downsides of `macro_reexport` that I know of are:\n- The source of macro is mangled during the reexportation process. This means that error messages of the macro when used from the reexported location get worse. For example compare [`std`'s `try!`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.try!.html) to [`core`'s](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/macro.try!.html)\n- The macro is just copy/pasted into the reexported crate. This means that references like `$crate` break because they don't refer to the original crate, but now the reexported crate. This means it's basically useless to reexport a macro unless the two crates have the same exact internal structure.\n\nI personally see this as a half-baked feature that was just nice to reduce duplication in std/core, it doesn't seem like it fits the normal high standard we might have for language features. There's certainly an argument that `macro_rules!` is \"bad enough\" that this doesn't make it worse, but I would prefer to not continue to make it worse.\n\nI'd be fine deprecating and removing this while just copying the macros between core/std to have the same source.\n",

    "body": "The first bug seems possible to fix -- if the mangled source of a macro is stored in crate metadata, the unmangled source can be too. I agree the second one is a downside, but it can be mitigated by `pub use`ing items that are referenced from a macro when you reexport it. And not all macros reference items in the crate anyway! With no stable way to reexport macros, macro crates _cannot participate in the dependency system_. So I think this makes `macro_rules!` better (though not a whole lot better), not worse.\n",
