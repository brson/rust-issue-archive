    "body": "I believe that this is technically correct as the _trait object_ `&Foo` does not implement the `Iterator` trait. This is similar to how the `Writer` trait is not implemented for `&mut Writer`, but rather there is a manual implementation for it. The fix you'll need is `impl<'a> Iterator<int> for &'a Foo { /* ... */ }`\n\nFor now, however, this is working as intended, so I'm going to close this.\n",
