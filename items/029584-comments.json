It is an implementation detail that should not leak out.\n- Because of the above, the fix is to not list the trait on the implementing type's page, **not** to generate a doc page for `FullOps`.\n- Other examples of such traits are `RawFloat` and `DecodableFloat` on `f32` and `f64`, which are also listed on the respective pages with dead links.\n",

    "body": "@Ketsuban Thanka for tracking this down! You are right that impls in private modules should generally be displayed since they are public in a sense. But I think the current state of affairs is very unsatisfying, since Rustdoc generates broken docs for perfectly valid code. Shouldn't it at the very least somit links that will wind up dead? And if both trait and implementing type are dic(hidden), as is the case here, it seems like a reasonable heuristic to treat the impl as hidden too. I'm less sure about hidden traits in public types (e.g., RawFloat and f64) but if it's overridable it also seems sensible.\n",
