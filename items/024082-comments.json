If this is in the wrong place, I'll move it to where it would be better suited. I'm not sure this is that important of an issue if it was specifically excluded from the change in `str.splitn`, it was just a bit confusing when using the slice method after using the new str method.\n",

Currently the count parameter on both functions indicates the number of returned items, for example:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    for a in \"ababa\".splitn(2, 'b') {\n        println!(\"{}\", a);\n    }\n    for a in [1, 2, 1, 2, 1].splitn(2, |x| *x == 2) {\n        println!(\"{:?}\", a);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\na\naba\n[1]\n[1, 2, 1]\n```\n\nDo you think this is a docs problem?\n",
