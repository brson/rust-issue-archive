Each of the sorts should probably get their own module. There should probably be some kind of sorting trait. But that all can be done later. Also, we probably don't need this many sort functions.\n",

MergeState's destructor calls `set_len`, so even if the task fails, `tmp` get cleaned up without double-freeing or running the destructors of anything left in it. The performance is better than `merge_sort` in all the cases I tested, and everywhere that `quick_sort` is faster, `quick_sort3` beats it.\n",

    "body": "This is going to need more tests. It's a complicated algorithm and all the included tests are on scalar data with small vectors. It looks to me like all the test cases cause timsort to immediately bail to the fast path, so there is no coverage for the difficult parts.\n\nNeeds tests with both managed and owned boxes, and with cases that cover the different strategies used by timsort. I know it's a bit more work, but it's important.\n\nFWIW, I've poked at writing more tests a few times, but don't have enough time right now to keep at it.\n",

On the one hand, I'm excited to see such improved performance; on the other it seems like \"unsafe required to do sorting\" is a bad sign, and I'm pretty hesitant to merge something ostensibly high-level like a sorting algorithm that has unsafe code all through it.\n\nI'm curious exactly how much the performance difference just has to do with hitting native memcpy. If it's \"most\", we should probably take a step back and figure out how to make vec-to-vec copies in general speed-competitive.\n",

The performance of `tim_sort` is actually about the same as `quick_sort3` on random data when I added a tls get and set call to the compare when getting the compare numbers.\n",
