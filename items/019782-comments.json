    "body": "Random comment on the benchmarks:\n\nIt's really weird that `find_rand_10_000` takes 12 ns, but `iter_100_000` takes 17 ns per element. Does that imply that we could make iteration faster by just calling `find` in a loop? That seems a little crazy to me.\n\nAnd since `iter_1000` would be iterating through ~ 24 KB, and `iter_100_000` would be iterating through 2.4 MB, I'd expect a bigger timing difference since we're stepping through two cache boundaries. Since we aren't, this leads to be believe iteration is speed limited by something other than cache, and is therefore a good candidate for optimization. Alternatively, Intel could just be prediction wizards and there's just no cache misses.\n",

A _substantial_ refactor would also potentially consider this fancy kind of BTree that shares data between pairs of children. Each child must be ~2/3's full or something. Can't remember the name.\n",

    "body": "Actually, looking at the benchmarking code, there seem to be many more differences between `insert_seq_n` and `insert_rand_n` than I originally thought:\n- Before the benchmark, the map being mutated is created sequentially in `insert_seq_n` while it is created randomly in `insert_rand_n`.\n- The map being mutated has exactly `n` elements in the sequential case, but at most `n` elements in the random case.\n- The map being mutated is likely to become very dense in the random case, as the keys range from 0 to `n` and `n` of them are being inserted.\n- In the sequential case, the element to be inserted and removed moves along sequentially, while the element is chosen randomly in the random case. (This is what I thought would be the only difference).\n- In the sequential case, every search will be a hit until the element being searched for ends up larger than any key, at which point every search will be a miss. In contrast, the keys for the random case are chosen independently of creation, and so some will hit and some will miss.\n",
