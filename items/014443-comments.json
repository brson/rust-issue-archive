    "body": "@bill-myers Having a CountedSet without the ability to find the most common elements seems pointless. I also can't think of a situation where I would need O(k) most common, but be willing to take additional overhead on every other operation. I don't think that the differences between the two are big enough to warrant having both a CountedSet and a RankedSet. \n\nI propose that I simply replace the current naive implementation of `most_common` with a partial heap sort (I must have been completely blind to miss that this is in fact how Python does it), and clearly state the time complexity in the documentation. That way, if a user really needs O(k) most common, he or she can implement it using some sort of binary heap, as you suggested.\n",

    "body": "This seems like a nice collection, thanks for taking the initiative for working on this!\n\nHere's a list of things I've seen about this:\n- This isn't included in the `collections` library just yet. You'll want to add `pub mod counted_set;` to `libcollections/lib.rs` as well as removing the `extern crate` directives in this file.\n- The inherent `add` methods should just be implementations in their respective traits. There shouldn't be a need to have both an inherent method and a trait method.\n- This requires that all keys always be `Clone`, but that shouldn't be necessary, right? Some methods may require `Clone`, but it doesn't seem that all of them require `Clone`.\n- The `most_common` method should not have to clone the keys.\n- The `elements` method starts out by cloning the entire map? It also clones keys multiple times, it should be able to return references, right?\n-  `get` is the same as `get_copy`\n- The `MutableMap` and `Map` traits seem like they shouldn't be implemented for a \"counted set\". Perhaps the `Set` traits should be implemented instead?\n- Make sure that all methods are documented well with what they do.\n- This module would benefit greatly from a few examples which show off how to use the map.\n- Tests should be in an inner `mod test` module by convention.\n- Be sure to have all code indented with 4 spaces (some of the code is indented extra spaces)\n",

    "body": "I'm not sure about the API here. For example, `elements()` returning a `Vec` of `&K`, with each element repeated by its count? That seems surprising to me. I would expect instead to get each element only once, and then be able to query the data structure to find out its count. Or more accurately, I would actually expect `elements()` to not exist at all, and to just use `iter()`, and have that return an `Iterator<(&K, uint)>`.\n\nI would also expect `iter()` to return a type defined in the `counted_set` module, rather than one pulled from `hashmap`, even if it's just a `pub type` for the `hashmap` iterator.\n\n`get()` should probably be renamed to `count_of()`.\n\n`keys()` and `values()` seems inappropriate. I have no idea what they would return. This is a set, not a key-value map. Just stick with `iter()`, and if I want the elements without their counts I can `map()` the iterator.\n\nWhy are `|` and `&` defined (and in terms of a private function confusingly named `get_min_or_max()` when it's really conceptually a `union_with()`)? I would not normally expect `set1 & set2` to return a union of the sets with the maximum counts, or `set1 | set2` to do the same with the minimum counts. That's very surprising behavior.\n\nSimilarly, `+` and `-` being defined is surprising, although understandable. But they should be defined as wrappers around `union()` and `difference()`, rather than being the primary implementations themselves.\n\nFor that matter, the normal set operations aren't defined here. I would expect `CountedSet` to follow the APIs of `HashSet` and `TreeSet` as closely as possible, only diverging where necessary to account for counts (e.g. set difference would subtract the second set count from the first, only removing the element entirely if the count hits 0).\n",

    "body": "I just looked up some more information on `multiset` (or \"Bag\", which is the name I've used for this data structure in the past). Wikipedia says `multiset` can actually be defined either to store counts or to store all the equivalent objects, which I guess means a counted set is actually just a form of multiset (and it explicitly lists `NSCountedSet` as an example). My concern with Rust calling it `multiset` is people coming from C++ will then expect it to be storing all the equivalent objects, but this implementation just stores counts.\n\nThere's also the question of whether this should be based on `HashMap` or `TreeMap`. C++ provides both versions (`multiset` and `unordered_multiset`). And Rust, of course, provides both variations for maps and sets. Forcing `CountedSet` to be just `HashMap` seems unnecessarily limiting. To that end, it would be nice to provide e.g. `CountedHashSet` + `CountedTreeSet`.\n\nOf course, it might be even nicer if we could simply provide a wrapper that can be initialized with either a `HashMap` or `TreeMap`, using traits to abstract away the common functionality, but unfortunately there's necessary functionality (such as iteration) that's not expressed as a trait.\n",

    "body": "@kballard Thank you for your feedback! I'll give it a thorough look tomorrow, but for now just a quick comment: most of the API and design decisions are not mine, I simply tried to emulate the [Python Counter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter). That's why it's based on a `HashMap`, and it uses these specific operators etc. However, what's appropriate for Python must certainly not be appropriate for Rust, so some discussion is needed so we can find the best fit.\n",

    "body": "@schmee I see. That explains some of the questions I had (like the behavior of `elements()`). My basic suggestion here would be to try and match the existing Set APIs used by `HashSet`/`TreeSet` instead of matching a Python API that has no precedent in Rust.\n",

This is certainly doable, but I don't feel like working on this right now, so I'm closing this pull request and maybe I'll reopen this at some point with a better design!\n",
