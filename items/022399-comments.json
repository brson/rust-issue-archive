    "body": "I'm not 100% sure this is dependent on having a stable ABI... AIUI, this issue more related to being able to match the file format packagers expect. That is, we _do_ currently version libraries and binaries via the included hash (it should change as versions change), but packagers expect the file format to include the trailing version numbers instead. (Maybe some are flexible enough to work with alternate versioning schemes?)\n\nHaving a non-stable ABI means one cannot easily release patches for already released dynamic libraries, but I suspect we're not intending to do so for the compiler, given the short 6 week release schedule and it doesn't mean we can't be able to conform to the file format expected.\n\nThat said, the lack of a non-stable ABI means that release dynamically linked Rust programs is slightly pointless.\n",

    "body": "If there's an ELF `DT_SONAME` tag, then there absolutely is an expectation of a stable ABI.  Sometimes it's `libfoo.so.MAJOR`, but it could be any ABI stamp committed to long ago, like glibc's current `libc.so.6`.  The usual setup then is a symlink chain `libfoo.so` (for linker `-lfoo`) -> `$SONAME` (for ld.so loading `DT_NEEDED`) -> `the-real-libfoo.so`, where the final name can take many forms.\n\nThen on top of this you can have symbol versions, which lets you safely extend an SONAME and even replace old symbols with better ones.  See Ulrich Drepper's [How To Write Shared Libraries](http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf), especially section 3 on ABIs.\n\nThat's what library versioning is really about, IMO.  But Rust doesn't set any SONAME right now anyway, and shouldn't bother until there's a stable ABI.  And even then, the developer has to really commit to maintaining a stable interface themselves too.\n",
