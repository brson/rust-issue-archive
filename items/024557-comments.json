I've been meaning to try to look at this for a long long time; for the most part we've always just triaged these issues as \"just a bug\", but that's not a reason to not try to fix them, if someone has time.\n\nI am very familiar with Will Clinger's paper, as he was my Ph.D advisor -- though floating-point parsing was not my topic area -- and I have seen him present the material more than once.  Also relevant are the other papers I listed on my comment here:\n\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/7648#issuecomment-23472198\n\nand possibly also relevant is Steele and White, _also_ from PLDI 1990, \"How to Print Floating Point Numbers Accurately\"\n\nand possibly also this recent paper:\n- http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/florian-loitsch/printf.pdf\n",

It compiles and said helper routines pass some tests but the whole thing is still missing some pieces before I can start running it against well-behaved inputs. I hope to finish this part next weekend.\n\nBefore I file a PR I also want to implement correct handling of overflowing, almost-overflowing, underflowing, subnormal and almost-subnormal numbers. This may turn out to be more tricky (the paper mentions this more as an afterthought) but I have a pretty clear plan of attack.\n\nRegarding 0.6: No, 0.60...0 is correct. It's not what Python outputs for `%.17f` (and I'm not sure if this is done using Martin Gay's code or the System `sprintf`) but 0.60...0 _is_ read back in correctly by Python. I can also promise that my dec2flt code will handle it as correctly as plain 0.6. It may not be _more_ correct than 0.59... but it's equally correct.\n",

There may be a relatively easy fix that's somewhat correct, but I'm not sure and (now that I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about proper support) I don't think the bandaid will be significantly faster to implement than a proper solution. I'll just have to implement bignum long division and Algorithm M from the paper &mdash; of which I have already written a reference implementation in Python &mdash; with checks for the minimum and maximum exponent. Well, and set the right cutoff for when to use Algorithm M.\n\nAside: I'm sure you're aware but @lifthrasiir's code correctly handles subnormals, at least on this example. Only the old code has this problem and 1.0 stable (and thus play.rust-lang.org with default settings) still uses the old code.\n",

I will go back later and do it again with proper bignum-based fractions in the future.\n\n---\n\nNow, as for the question of what _should_ be printed (since we seem to have a number of options available to us) ... obviously when you use `{}` then the shortest output possible is nice (perhaps even \"required\").  But when someone requests a certain number of decimals, I would usually opt to print a value as close as possible to the value that is actually represented by the floating point value.\n\nBased on some interactions with a Scheme interpreter (my go-to choice for bignum stuff), the 64-bit float for `0.6` corresponds to the following base-10 decimal value:\n\n``` scheme\n0.59999999999999997779553950749686919152736663818359375\n```\n\nFrom this we can see why @kballard might expect to see `0.59999999999999998` from `{:.17}` -- that really is close to the represented value (assuming my Scheme code and runtime is accurate...)\n\n---\n\nSo: Its possible that some people may be annoyed by our current flt2dec handling of specifications like `{:.17}`, and I may be curious enough to dive into the flt2dec code again to try to understand why we are not handling this as I would expect there ... but I would not call it a \"bug\" per se, I do not think.\n",

The path that utilizes bignums is only exercised in exceptional cases, right?\n- I mean, yes, there is the unfortunate subsequent bloating of libstd; but we can work on reducing the amount of code size it introduces later...\n\nI'm referring to the `libnum` crate removed in fb169d5543c84e11038ba2d07b538ec88fb49ca6 that currently lives in https://github.com/rust-lang/num\n\n---\n\nUpdate: Its possible I'm missing the point and that the abstractions provided by `libnum` does not suffice; still, seems like it might be a nice starting point...\n",

    "body": "Decimal parsing and float formatting lives in libcore, i.e., can't use dynamic memory allocation. That alone already rules out using libnum verbatim. If I dug deeper, I'd probably find several other reasons, but it's a moot point since @lifthrasiir has already implemented almost all functionality I need (and all that flt2dec needs).\n\nFYI, while _division_ is only needed in exceptional cases, most code paths do require a bignum to some degree (subtraction, comparison, multiplication by powers of two and ten). I realized just now how it can be avoided on some cases (fewer than 15 decimal digits and the absolute decimal exponent is less than 23) but it's still required even for some relatively common cases.\n\nMaybe libnum's code for division is a good starting point algorithmically, and I'll make sure to look at it in more depth before I dive into implementing division, but from a cursory glance it seems like importing the code and whipping it into something working may be more trouble than writing division from scratch.\n",

    "body": "Just to note, I think that `{:17}` printing `0.60000000000000000` is explicitly wrong. Yes, typing that as a float literal will yield the exact same value that typing `0.59999999999999998` does, which is a perfectly fine rationale for why `{}` should print `0.6`. But when there's multiple possible string representations at a given precision that evaluate to the same value, it should print the _most accurate_ one. Printing something that's not strictly accurate is only a reasonable choice when this results in printing fewer digits\n\nWhich is to say, the behavior of printing some value that's not strictly accurate but evaluates to the same value when parsed as an IEEE floating-point value is behavior that's only appropriate when precision has not been specified. When output precision has been specified, it should always print based on the precise floating-point representation.\n",

    "body": "> I hope to finish this part next weekend.\n\nFamous last words, heh.\n\nThat said, I also did a lot of other clean up and refactoring and testing, confirmed a couple of bugs I'd long suspected, and addressed the underlying issues satisfactorily. For example, up-front input validation is now pretty comprehensive and prevents any way I can think of to cause integer  (including bignum) overflow during the conversion.\n\nAs for actual functionality: the code paths for nice inputs work now and passed a couple of simple tests. I'm not willing to declare it correct yet, but I'm hopeful. This is only for f64 as of now (of course I can parse into f64 and cast that to f32 and indeed I do that, and have plenty of test cases where it fails). Still missing, in order:\n- AlgorithmM. This is mostly blocked on bignum `divmod`. I know when to call it, I just have to write the damn thing.\n- Refactor everything so that f32 parsing works (correctly).\n- Many many more tests.\n- In particular, unit/regression tests in libcoretest. All tests so far are of the \"take several minutes to try millions of inputs\" kind. Those are necessary, but they can't reasonably be run by bors on every merge.\n- Get an idea of the performance, especially for common inputs. There are a few easy optimizations that I'm itching to try out. (Yeah, I also want to land this feature soon, but if I don't do this now, I risk putting it off forever.)\n- Actually integrating the code into libcore. It's currently an independent crate for much faster edit-compile-run cycles.\n\nI won't make any predictions, but I feel I've solved all the hard problems and the rest is polishing and making sure I haven't overlooked any hard problems.\n",

    "body": "My code is now at https://github.com/rkruppe/rust-dec2flt (virtually no git history though). The modifications to @lifthrasiir's bignum code are in my rust fork in the `dec2flt` branch.\n\n@pnkfelix Thanks for the offer, but splitting the work between two people seems tough. None of the steps are particularly hard in isolation and most depend on earlier steps. For example, half of the testing can't be done before f32 is properly supported, and integrating into libcore before the code is 99% done would just slow down the edit-compile-test cycle significantly.\n\nThat said, additional test cases are always good and the optimizations should be independent from everything else. If either interests you, take a look at what's there and submit a PR. Since you'll be the ideal reviewer for the PR, even reading through the code will be valuable. And if you notice a bug, a possible optimization, a way to simplify the code, etc. &mdash; great!\n",

    "body": "Quick FYI, AlgorithmM is implemented and everything works with `f32`. I ran so many different tests and hammered out so many bugs that I'll going out on a limb and declare it functionally complete. Now to clean up the code some more, optimize it a little bit more, and write even more tests to ease my paranoia! Here's hoping this won't take another two weeks :smile: \n",
