  "body": "This allows mass-initialization of large structs without having to specify all the fields.\n\nI'm a bit hesitant, but I wanted to get this out there. I don't really like using the `Zero` trait, because it doesn't really make sense for a type like `HashMap` to use `Zero` as the 'blank allocation' trait. In theory there'd be a new trait, but then that's adding cruft to the language which may not necessarily need to be there.\n\nI do think that this can be useful, but I only implemented `Zero` on the basic types where I thought it made sense, so it may not be all that usable yet. (opinions?)\n",
