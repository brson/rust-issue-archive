Our loops are probably not hygienic at the moment, but hopefully they will be in future and so removing this only to add it back in later seems counter-productive.\n",

    "body": "> also, it's worth noting that #6993 is specifically \"replace Ident by Name after libsyntax\", i.e. libsyntax (and presumably the resolve pass) still needs Idents.\n\nYeah, bad wording from my side!\n\nI tested something similar to the first example yday and forgot to comment back here. Anyway, I gave both your examples a try with and without this change, as expected the behavior was the same in both cases. The first example works as expected whereas the second one doesn't.\n\nPresumably, reverting #9103 should make our for-loops hygienic again.\n\nI'll close this PR and work on bringing the hygienic behavior back.\n\nThanks @huonw and @alexcrichton \n",
