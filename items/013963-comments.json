    "body": "@alexcrichton I agree that we should hold off on r+'ing immediately, although I don't want to wait too long as this is likely to bitrot fast. But I do think it's something we need to do.\n\n> `FromIterator` was the only way to construct a variable sized `~[T]` right now.\n\nAssuming you mean without cloning `T`. Correct. But `~[T]` isn't growable any more, and yet that's precisely what `FromIterator` was: a method of growing a `~[T]`.\n\n> The performance hit (in its current state) is not a reason to migrate.\n\nThe problem is not just the performance hit on constructing `~[T]`. The problem is this performance hit spread throughout disparate parts of the standard libraries. Even methods that claimed they converted into a `~[T]` without copying were in fact copying memory (doing it twice, no less! Because the `FromIterator` impl had to copy into a `Vec<T>` and then copy from there into a `~[T]`).\n\n> I want to talk about this at tomorrow's meeting\n\nPlease do. My impression was, with the movement of I/O toward `Vec<T>`, that it had tentatively been decided to go ahead and migrate APIs to `Vec<T>`, with the understanding that they could be migrated back if it was determined that `~[T]` really is the correct type long-term (which I really don't think it is; converting from `Vec<T>` to `~[T]` post-DST is not free, nor is converting back if the API client wants a `Vec<T>` after all).\n\nMy belief is that this is the right move, and in fact we should think about moving even more APIs away from `~[T]` (although this PR only concerned itself with APIs that broke when the `FromIterator` impl was removed).\n",

This same trait can then be reused for smart pointers once DST lands (e.g. for `Rc<[T]>`).\n",

    "body": "@nick29581 @alexcrichton @pcwalton It's rebased on top of latest master, and includes the requested changes.\n\nThe one additional breaking change was removing `&[T]`/`~[T]` addition, as that cannot be implemented to return `Vec` with `Add` being defined in libcore. It's still defined for `Vec<A> + T:Vector<A>` (although I'm of the opinion that even that should be removed, but it's not applicable to this PR).\n\nThis has passed a full `make check` locally.\n",
