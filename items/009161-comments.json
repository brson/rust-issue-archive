I think the only people this would look weird to are those coming from something like mustache or the django template language.  \n\nIn Shell, Perl, Groovy, Scala and I'm sure others, ${} indicates variable substitution, and Ruby uses #{}, so someone coming from those languages seeing %{ might guess that was indicating a sub, not escaping, but doesn't seem like an insurmountable surprise.  \n\nC, C++, ObjC, D, Go, Python, Haskell, Java, Clojure, PHP, and R are all printf or derived (though Haskell has a .Net-like template package and PHP supports interpolation with $), and JavaScript punts to a billion and a half different templating libraries, so don't have much guidance to offer given we've already put printf syntax behind us.\n\nEd:  for the record, I'm fine w/ %, or whatever, really.

    "body": "Sorry about that, I should have put more information in the commit message. Here's the situation we're in:\n\nRight now we're using `\\` as an escape character. The main reason for doing this is that every programmer instantly recognizes `\\` as an escape sequence. This does have a serious downside though. The format string parser is not parsing the raw source file, but rather rust's interpretation of a _string literal_. What this means is that the characters you type pass through two parsers, first the rust parser, then the format string parser. What this means is that to escape the `{` character, you've got something like this:\n\n```\n\"\\\\{\" => rust parser => \"\\{\" => format parser => \"{\"\n```\n\nAnd that's not even the worst part. If you want a literal `\\` character in your output string, you have to format that with _four_ slashes: `\"\\\\\\\\\" => rust => \"\\\\\" => format => \"\\\"`. So basically for these reasons, I'm seeing that the `\\` character as an escape is basically un-usable. @thestinger and I had a discussion on IRC where we came to the conclusion that passing through `\\\\` as `\\\\` probably wouldn't work.\n\nSo now that we've ruled out `\\` as an escape character, let's pick the next most natural thing. Python has a pretty good way of doing this by having `{{` become `{` and vice-versa `}`. With an excellent example from @huonw on IRC though, this leads to ambiguities. What should this format string become?\n\n```\n{0, select, other{test }} }}\n```\n\nBasically, we support methods where python does not (to support internationalization). What this means is that `}}` will naturally come up in the grammar as simply closing blocks. Again, sadly, the standard convention is unusable (although this has a better reason for being unusable than `\\`).\n\nSo now we're back to square one. The syntaxes that @jfager was mentioning were mostly for interpolation, and this is rather for escaping. I do agree though that `#{}` may be easy to conflate with `%{` when you first see it, but I think some quick usage where you will never see `%{}` will make you soon realize that `%` is an escape character. That being said, I'm still not too fond of using `%` as an escape character, I would much rather use `\\`. In this situation though, `%` has fewer drawbacks than `\\` in my mind.\n\n@jfager, @sanxiyn, are you guys ok with that explanation? I wish there were a better solution, but I'm drawing blanks :(\n",

    "body": "In the case of `{0, select, other{test }} }}`, you need to close two brackets. Is the first pair of brackets the closing ones? Or is the second pair the closing one? Which one counts as the double-escape? It's ambiguous which-is-which.\n\nFor example, modify it slightly to `{0, select, other{test}} }}`, then we get:\n\n```\n// first pair is the escape sequence\nformat!(\"{0, select, other{test}} }}\", \"a\") // => ~\"test} \"\n\n// second pair is the escape sequence\nformat!(\"{0, select, other{test}} }}\", \"a\") // => ~\"test }\"\n```\n\nThose two strings are different, yet have the same format string, and we don't know which you specified. Also, if we resort to typing `}}}}` to escape `}`, then we're no better off than we were with `\\\\\\\\` sadly :(\n",
