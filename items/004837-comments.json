    "body": "Rust does already make a strict distinction between bytes and strings. A string (types named `str`) are UTF-8; an array of bytes (types named `[u8]`) make no restriction on their contents. A `cat` program generally does not deal with text (in any encoding), but plain bytes. So for that generally one should use `[u8]` rather than `str`.\n\nBut I generally agree that:\n- Rust's string-based IO routines should provide a condition for hooking in different behavior when presented with malformed UTF-8. The current behavior predates conditions, and should be upgraded.\n- Rust's standard library should contain an interface to iconv, so that we can accept input in multiple character sets from the _outside_ of a rust program. Currently we only really support UTF-8 and UTF-16 (for windows compatibility).\n\nI'll rename this bug to match these concerns.\n",

    "body": "Agreed on the blurred subject(s). I know `[u8]` and `str` are separate, but practically speaking `[u8]` is not much used compared to `str` even when it should be used due to the lack of useful methods on `[u8]`. Personally I hit this issue many times during porting some program in C to Rust.\n\nIn the short term, I'm thinking of adding two functions to `core::str` (and possibly `impl &str`):\n\n```\npure fn fix_utf8_range(s: &str, begin: uint, end: uint, handler: &fn(&[u8]) -> ~str) -> ~str;\npure fn fix_utf8(s: &str, handler: &fn(&[u8]) -> ~str) -> ~str;\n```\n\n...so that one can write `str::fix_utf8(line_just_read, |_| ~\"\\ufffd\")`. Maybe that is for another issue though.\n",

In any case, I think there's been a pile of rumblings/discussion recently about how to handle encodings properly, and there's a bug specifically about this https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6164.\n\nI'm closing this in favour of the two bugs above, reopen if you disagree.\n",
