    "body": "@catamorphism From reading commit 3fcdb7d6a758ac4ed1f27fcda77c372edaab4c09 where the original FIXME was injected and which introduced `begin_unwind_`, it looks like `begin_unwind_` was originally called from only two places: `rt_fail_` and `begin_unwind`.\n\nSo I suspect the intention of the FIXME was to say \"once we get rid of `rt_fail_`, we should manually inline the body of `begin_unwind_` into `begin_unwind` and then get rid of `begin_unwind_` itself.\n\nI'll try to do that now.\n",

    "body": "Of course, commit 3fcdb7d6a758ac4ed1f27fcda77c372edaab4c09 also ensured that its `begin_unwind` and `begin_unwind_`, which both lived in `sys.rs`, had the same signature.  I poked around a little, it looks to me like @catamorphism was talking about a different `begin_unwind` method of the `Unwinder` struct (currently in `std::rt::task` though at the time of @catamorphism's comment it was in `core::rt::local_services`).\n\nAnyway, at this point, there are now six callers of `begin_unwind_`; two of them live in sys.rs right next to `begin_unwind_` (those probably replaced the earlier `begin_unwind` from commit 3fcdb7d6a758ac4ed1f27fcda77c372edaab4c09), a third is `fail_` from libstd/unstable/lang.rs, and the remaining three are in `std::rt::borrowck` (my reaction to that last one: \"reallly?  weird.\")\n",

    "body": "In case it is not clear, I was visiting this bug for triage last week, for 2013-07-15.  I had thought it would be easy to fix this based on my analysis from [my earlier comment](#issuecomment-21039130).  But further investigation revealed that new external callers of `begin_unwind_` have been introduced.  I spent some time trying to at least change the interface used by the external callers to not use unsafe code (e.g. not use native pointers to null terminated strings) but that did not appear to be an easy local transformation in the majority of the cases.\n",
