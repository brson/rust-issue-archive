The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pcwalton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@mihneadb these were just queries I wanted to do that don't work right now. Launch this as is, and we can add more stuff later.\n\nI have no idea how performant compressing this stuff in JS is. [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako) looks like a nice library (the deflate part is 26k minified). You might want to test how well that works. Don't forget that these docs are also served locally; I don't know how to load a compressed file so that it can be read in JS without using AJAX requests.\n\nIf you are concerned about the file size, it might help to restructure the JSON output a bit. E.g. change\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\"name\": \"char\"},\n    {\"name\": \"i32\"}\n  ],\n  \"output\": {\n    \"name\": \"char\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nto:\n\n``` json\n[\n  [\"char\", \"i32\"],\n  \"char\"\n]\n```\n",
