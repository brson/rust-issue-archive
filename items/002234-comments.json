    "body": "I found a [extract_grammer.py](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/etc/extract_grammar.py) script in `src/etc`, which extracts the grammer from `rust.md`, but the resulting grammer does not work with LLnextgen at the moment. There is no separate lexing step. My approach is to use flex for lexical analysis (for everything in Section 3 of the manual) and use LLnextgen for the parsing.\n\nSo far, I stumbled over one part of the grammer where I think the productions in the `rust.md` are not LL(1).\nI think there is a FIRST/FOLLOW conflict in `block_comment` . `block_comment_body` in  `block_comment` is can be epsilon and is followed by '_' and an alternative in `block_comment_body` starts with '_', so it isn't possible to decide which production to take with look ahead of 1\n\n```\nblock_comment : \"/*\" block_comment_body * '*' + '/' ;\nblock_comment_body : non_star * | '*' + non_slash_or_star ;\n```\n\nBut I think ignoring comments should be done in the lexer, so this wouldn't be a problem for the Rust grammer being LL(1).\n",
