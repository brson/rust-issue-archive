    "body": "Ah sorry @Gankro, been a bit busy. Here are some thoughts:\n- Generic approach to comparators seems fine. Similar to what C++ does with their priority queue.\n- Does it make sense for `RevOrdering` to reverse `Comparator` or should it simply reverse `Ord`?\n- Really like the `min_heap`, `max_heap` constructors.\n- For ease of use, do we want `min_heap_with_*` etc? To abstract away explicit comparators? I'm not really sure, but we should probably go with the way easiest for the users.\n\nGenerally the approach seems fine. Good job!\n\nAnother idea _could_ be to specify `PriorityQueue` as a trait, and make `MinHeap` and `MaxHeap` (possibly other names) which implement the trait. But it seems like the only thing we would gain by going that route would be to avoid one extra typename.\n\nAnd later on when we standardize the library more, maybe `Comparator` could be useful for other structures? `TreeSet` and `TreeMap` comes to mind.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the feedback, @treeman!\n- With RevOrdering I'm favouring composability in the same way Iterators work. I want to eventually move this out into a common area so people can write their own Comparators, and this will wrap any comparator to reverse it. Maybe I should make rev a method on all Comparators? And expose the full Cmp interface while I'm at it?\n- I don't have any strong feeling on min/max_heap_with_*. I agree it would be useful. Don't know if the bloat is justified.\n- PriorityQueue should definitely become a trait eventually, but I don't think this is the PR for that, though. \n",

Are there many open questions about how unboxed closures will behave/look, or is unboxed closures basically done?\n\nAssuming they take the from described in the RFC, I propose that the Comparator trait is still desirable for the following reasons:\n- Clarity: `cmp.ge(a, b)` is _much_ clearer to me than `cmp(a, b) != Less`\n- Efficiency: It's possible that the individual operations could be written more efficiently than simply wrappers around `cmp`. If the comparator is being used as a building block for a collection, this overhead could be significant.\n- Adapters: we can add a `.rev()` method to a Comparator Trait in the same vein as Iterators\n- Nothing lost: It's easy enough to write a Comparator genericized over an unboxed closure, to permit easy conversion\n",
