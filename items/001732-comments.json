    "body": "Sorry to jump in here, but I'd like to stress that calling C functions should be fast, as in _blazing_ fast. If I want to write a game in rust using a C library like Allegro, SDL, or Opengl, this is essential. Otherwise the game will slow down in the rendering code where there are a lot of C calls, which is unacceptable. The default Go language compiler with cgo has such problems. \n\nSo I'd prefer a solution that is fast, even though it may restrict what the function on the Rust side can do. \n\nAlso, wouldn't it be an idea to use \"native fn\" in stead of  \"crust fn\" or does that have another planned meaning? \n",
