    "body": "I'm increasingly concerned about this from a library design view point. It requires defining and importing a whole pile of extra traits, and also requires a library author to remember and think about \"enabling\" trait objects for a trait.\n\nE.g. `Iterator` and `std::rand::Rng` are traits for which it is sensible to make trait objects, but they have generic methods, and, the standard library/tests/compiler never make trait objects out of them, meaning this 'problem' will only be picked up by users. Separating out a trait to rectify this is backwards incompatible, and also may require users to manually implement multiple traits (not everything is like `Iterator` and `Rng` where the generic methods are default methods).\n\nMost libraries will have less associated code than our stdlib and compiler, and so even less \"chance\" for a trait object to be made and hence a lower chance of detecting the problem locally.\n",

    "body": "I share @huonw and @alexcrichton's concerns about the impact of this on library APIs. In particular, @huonw's point that this\n\n> requires a library author to remember and think about \"enabling\" trait objects for a trait.\n\nis a very good one that was not discussed at the meeting where we accepted this RFC. And as we're seeing with the changes needed for `std` alone, this looks like it would involve a fair amount of additional API complexity.\n\nI think this RFC merits another round of discussion before we land these changes, where we think through the concrete implications on `std`. I also think we should consider the alternatives more closely.\n\nThat said, it's interesting to consider the design of `Iterator` with respect to trait objects. Yes, you can create trait objects around iterators today, but you lose most of the adapters -- and not for any good reason. Right now, these adapters are set up via default methods, which are basically not overridable because they nail down specific concrete iterator return types. If we did split this out as a core trait with e.g. just `next`, and an `IteratorAdapters` trait with the rest of the methods, we could provide a _blanket_ impl of `IteratorAdapters` for any `Iterator`. That would allow the adapters to be used even for boxed iterators.\n\n(On the other hand, in the future these adapter types could be provided as associated types via HKT, and then you _could_ specialize the implementations for performance reasons...)\n",

    "body": "I'm happy to discuss it more, but I still think this is the right approach. I think it's a GOOD thing that trait authors have to think about enabling traits for objects at trait design time. Specifically, if you have some trait X that is not object safe, then it means that if we permit objects to be created they are second-class citizens: many of the methods of the trait are unavailable, and you cannot use them with generic functions (because the type X cannot implement the trait X).\n\nIterator makes for a good case study. The fact that we could create objects of type Iterator means that we think the current design is object-friendly, but actually it's quite hostile: you can call `next` on an `Iterator<int>`, but not `map` or `filter`. Moreover, if I have some generic function:\n\n```\nfn foo<T:Iterator<int>>(t: T) { ... }\n```\n\nthen I can't use my `Box<Iterator<int>>` with this fn either. \n\nIt would be better if we made the core iterator trait object-safe and then implemented `map` and other things as extension traits. This would mean that iterators cannot override map and friends, but in exchange they would be usable on objects. Seems like a good trade to me personally.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis \n\nActually, a follow-up for iterators:\n\nSuppose we went with the design where you _can_ create trait objects for any trait, but that you only get DST-style impls for certain traits.\n\nWe would not get the automatic DST-style impl for `Iterator`, but we could always provide an `impl` ourselves. That would retain the simplicity of having a single trait, while allowing full-fledged use of boxed iterators.\n\nAnother, somewhat related worry: fully automatic DST-style `impl` of traits for trait objects means that you'll _never_ be able to provide your own custom `impl`. Is that a problem? I think it's probably fine, but worth thinking about.\n",

    "body": "@aturon Yes, I realize it's a tradeoff. Clearly this is a point about which reasonable people can disagree. \n\nI think I'd prefer to make the distinction sharper precisely because I think it's easily forgotten, so the more we gray the line the more people get confused. I think it's clear from this conversation that it's very easy to not realize the repercussions of generic methods in a trait and so forth. (It almost makes me wonder if it's worth having a different declaration form or some other way to opt-in to advanced features.)\n\nIt's worth considering what the workarounds are in both cases. Under this design, end users who want an object but can't have one have to make a copy of the trait that deletes the disallowed methods. This is annoying, but has the advantage that its limitations are clear: naturally you won't be able to the disallowed methods on the new trait, since they're not there, and naturally you won't be able to use the trait elsewhere.\n\nUnder the other design, the workaround is... well, I don't know what it is. I guess we could permit you to hand-write an impl that failed if you tried to use the negative methods.\n\nRegarding overriding `map` -- it occurs to me that impl specialization could give us a \"best of both worlds\". That is, you can make the `IteratorMap` trait specializable -- and then specialize it when the iterable type is _known_ to be your particular iterator. (Also, if we want to preserve the ability to override at all, we have to be very careful about the return type, as you are well aware, since you originally raised the issue.)\n",

As a relevant aside, many people I've spoken to about this issue over the years when we've been debating it :) have found the very notion of `impl Iterator for Iterator` confusing. Basically I think that the pun of using a trait name for both a type and an object is a good one so long as the brain can kind of elide the difference -- but when there start to be subtle differences, it can be hard to even talk about.\n",

And in all that code there were only 3(?) traits which broke with this change. And I agree with Niko, in those cases, the split caused a better design - extracting the `by_ref` methods from Reader/Writer seems like a good idea.\n\nWe discussed @aturon's suggestion, the problem is that having T not implement T for some traits seems even worse than having T not implement T all the time - I would hate to have to explain that to someone.

    "body": "@alexcrichton In the future, that use of `Box<Iterator>` _could_ be replaced with an associated type + HKT:\n\n``` rust\npub trait Headers {\n    // Theoretical\n    pub type HeaderEntries<'a>: Iterator<(&'a str, Vec<&'a str>)>;\n\n    fn find<'a>(&'a self, key: &str) -> Option<Vec<&'a str>>;\n    fn has(&self, key: &str) -> bool;\n    fn iter<'a>(&'a self) -> HeaderEntries<'a>;\n}\n```\n\nThat said, we can't do it today, which is _critical_ since there is no promise of when if ever HKT will be added, and it seems it will almost certainly be after 1.0.\n\nIn my experience with downstream Rust code, `Box<Iterator>` is not particularly common as it is slow for Iterators common case, but use of trait objects for traits which are not fully object safe _is_ much more common.\n\nFor instance, in Iron, we've got:\n\n``` rust\npub trait Chain: Handler {\n    fn new<H: Handler>(H) -> Self;\n    fn link<B, A>(&mut self, (B, A)) where A: AfterMiddleware, B: BeforeMiddleware;\n    fn link_before<B>(&mut self, B) where B: BeforeMiddleware;\n    fn link_after<A>(&mut self, A) where A: AfterMiddleware;\n    fn around<A>(&mut self, A) where A: AroundMiddleware;\n}\n```\n\nwhich is not object safe, but it is still useful to make `Box<Chain>` objects because you can still call the inherited `Handler` methods through one. In practice, this is usually accomplished through making it a `Box<Handler>`, but this is only one case. It's entirely possible that `Chain` could grow more methods which could be called through an Object, and losing the ability to do `Box<Chain>` would then be very painful.\n\nGenerally, it's sometimes useful to have methods which you can only call through `T: Trait` but still have the ability to do `Box<Trait>`.  Under this proposal, we would have to have two different traits, which just feels unnecessarily unergonomic.\n",
