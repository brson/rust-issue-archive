It would also force the compiler to look for such patterns, something that would be so fragile it would make the feature useless.\n\nIf you're asking to treat `Variant(a,b,c).foo()` as a call to `(a,b,c).foo()`, then that isn't possible because methods are resolved based on the type.\n\nI'm going to close this as I cannot think of a realistic use case where you wouldn't just use a tuple anyway.\n",
