The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @huonw (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

I would expect, however, that a socket which has been shut down prevents all future reads as well, so I'm a little curious as to why you're getting an error. Could you paste the logs of the test?\n",

    "body": "Hm interestingly enough it appears I wasn't even reading the output of my program! It also appears to return an error (of the same kind). Oddly enough it looks like it _also_ unblocks any pending read (but not future reads).\n\nIn light of this we may not want to expose this at this time. One can indeed `connect` a UDP socket to another address, but we don't currently expose support for that. I think it may be best to actually hold off on this for now until a need for it arises, how does that sound?\n",
