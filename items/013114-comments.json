    "body": "I moved all the bytes to `u64` conversion to using a new `u64_from_le_bytes`, combined the various writer functions into a macro and added a comment explaining why I am overriding them in the first place. I think that covers all the concerns brought up. If this looks good, I'll squash and rebase.\n\nIncidentally, why are `u64_from_le_bytes` and friends in `io::extensions` instead of `mem`? They are largely unrelated to input and output.\n",
