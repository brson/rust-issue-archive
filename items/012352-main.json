  "body": "This deadlock was caused when the channel was closed at just the right time, so\nthe extra `self.cnt.fetch_add` actually should have preserved the DISCONNECTED\nstate of the channel. by modifying this the channel entered a state such that\nthe port would never succeed in dropping.\n\nThis also moves the increment of self.steals until after the MAX_STEALS block.\nThe reason for this is that in 'fn recv()' the steals variable is decremented\nimmediately after the try_recv(), which could in theory set steals to -1 if it\nwas previously set to 0 in try_recv().\n\nCloses #12340\n",
