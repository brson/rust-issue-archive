  "body": "Implements https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/192.\n\nIn particular:\n1. type parameters can have lifetime bounds and objects can close over borrowed values, presuming that they have suitable bounds.\n2. objects must have a bound, though it may be derived from the trait itself or from a `Send` bound.\n3. all types must be well-formed.\n4. type parameters and lifetime parameters may themselves have lifetimes as bounds. Something like `T:'a` means \"the type T outlives 'a`\" and something like`'a:'b`\" means \"'a outlives 'b\". Outlives here means \"all borrowed data has a lifetime at least as long\".\n\nThis is a [breaking-change]. The most common things you have to fix after this change are:\n1. Introduce lifetime bounds onto type parameters if your type (directly or indirectly) contains a reference. Thus a struct like `struct Ref<'a, T> { x: &'a T }` would be changed to `struct Ref<'a, T:'a> { x: &'a T }`.\n2. Introduce lifetime bounds onto lifetime parameters if your type contains a double reference. Thus a type like `struct RefWrapper<'a, 'b> { r: &'a Ref<'b, int> }` (where `Ref` is defined as before) would need to be changed to `struct RefWrapper<'a, 'b:'a> { ... }`.\n3. Explicitly give object lifetimes in structure definitions. Most commonly, this means changing something like `Box<Reader>` to `Box<Reader+'static>`, so as to indicate that this is a reader without any borrowed data. (Note: you may wish to just change to `Box<Reader+Send>` while you're at it; it's a more restrictive type, technically, but means you can send the reader between threads.)\n\nThe intuition for points 1 and 2 is that a reference must never outlive its referent (the thing it points at). Therefore, if you have a type `&'a T`, we must know that `T` (whatever it is) outlives `'a`. And so on.\n\nCloses #5723.\n",
