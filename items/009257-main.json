  "body": "If a static is flagged as address_insignificant, then for LLVM to actually\nperform the relevant optimization it must have an internal linkage type. What\nthis means, though, is that the static will not be available to other crates.\nHence, if you have a generic function with an inner static, it will fail to link\nwhen built as a library because other crates will attempt to use the inner\nstatic externally.\n\nThis gets around the issue by inlining the static into the metadata. The same\nrelevant optimization is then applied separately in the external crate. What\nthis ends up meaning is that all statics tagged with #[address_insignificant]\nwill appear at most once per crate (by value), but they could appear in multiple\ncrates.\n\nThis should be the last blocker for using format! ...\n",
