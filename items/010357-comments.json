Depends if it were just a matter of defaults, or\nsomething that would be overridden.\n\nMore and more I am coming to the opinion that we need a distinct\n`class` and `struct` (yet again I find I admire C++). In my view, a\n`class` would have very different defaults from a struct which are all\noriented around encapsulation:\n- not implicitly copyable,\n- fields private,\n- fields must be declared mutable to be mutated,\n- (perhaps) not creatable via `Foo { ... }` expressions outside the\n  module where the class is declared.\n\nwhereas a struct would be what we know and love today.\n\nThe last point is something that's been rattling around in my brain\nlately. We removed field-level mutability because it interacted poorly\nwith inherited mutability, but that is partially because of the way\nthat we interpreted it (\"always mutable\"). Another interpretation of\nfield-level mutability would be \"mutable if uniquely reachable\", which\nis how we interpret `&mut` today. In that case, we could go back to\n`mut` fields. Fields not declared `mut` would not be directly\nassignable; of course they could still change value if the entire\nstruct/class is overwritten as a whole, but they can't be changed\nindepdendently. These rules would play nicely with the borrow checker\nand address the desire to have fields that can only be set when the\nstruct as a whole is initialized.\n",
