    "body": "I don't think so. The reason is that shifts outside the range [0, bit_size - 1] are already undefined behavior (per https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10183), and for builtin types every valid shift amount (all <= 63) fits within 8 bits comfortably. I don't think there would be problems even if the shifting behavior was defined to be anything reasonable (i.e., either reducing modulo bitsize or zeroing the variable).\n",
