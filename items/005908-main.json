This integer will eventually be a reference to a side-table of syntax contexts, presumably stored in TLS. This pull request also adds a bunch of utility functions required for hygiene, and associated tests, but doesn't actually deploy those functions.\n\nFinally, it also has a number of small cleanup items.\n",
