I've tried to cleanup and comment the logic for function calls and in particular foreign function calls, so hopefully it won't be too hard to figure out.\n",

It looks pretty good, I'd just like to see one minor stylistic fix (not returning the immediate flag but rather using methods on the `FnCtxt`). Obviously, it needs rebase, and yes it will conflict with #6661 but we'll deal with it. #6661 still has not landed (mired in niggly ABI details of various platforms, but getting closer) so whichever lands first the other can rebase.\n",
