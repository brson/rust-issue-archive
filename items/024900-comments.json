However, it seems likely to me that there is a hard distinction between lints and compiler errors that will always be true: the former has levels (including 'disabled').\n",

    "body": "I want to emphasize that the most useful portion of such lints would be an explanation of how to turn them off or suppress them, both globally or in the specific case.\n\nAs such, perhaps it would make sense to have a generic reusable explanation of `#[blah]` vs `#![blah]` (perhaps as `L0000`).\n\nFor the extended message for the dead_code case specifically, it might also make sense to have a pointer to `cfg`, `cfg_attr` and the associated possible logic options, as those things (particularly `cfg_attr` and the logic options) are not easy to stumble upon in my experience - even if that's only a pointer to the relevant section of the official docs. I only found out about `cfg_attr` when Huon mentioned it to me (context: wrote about 2-3,000 lines of Rust over the last 3-4 months before that).\n",
