It may be worth benchmarking the difference in compile time for crates with lots of `#[derive(Clone)]` to get a handle on what the impact is going to be.\n",

    "body": "I ran the two tests @alexcrichton described, code: https://gist.github.com/Diggsey/7268beefb47a2cc9a740\n\nEach test was run five times, and the best result used (all times are in seconds):\n\n```\n              before       after\ntest_0.rs       2.08        7.43        (struct with 1000 fields)\ntest_1.rs       1.90        3.23        (1000 structs)\n```\n\nSo clearly this does have a large negative impact on compile times.\n\nHowever, in real code it's extremely rare to _only_ derive `Clone`: normally you'd at least be deriving `Debug` or `PartialEq` as well, so I reran the same tests, but with `#derive(Clone, Debug)`.\n\n```\n              before       after\ntest_0.rs          -           -        (struct with 1000 fields)\ntest_1.rs       4.02        5.36        (1000 structs)\n```\n\nUnfortunately, rustc overflowed its stack for `test_0.rs`, both before and after this change.\n",

It's good to know that it's not outlandishly more than that, but could you also try this out on an idiomatic crate with lots of derives? The example that comes to mind for me is winapi, but there may be others as well.\n",
