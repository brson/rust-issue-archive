    "body": "It's not a correct implementation of `TotalEq`. It requires these invariants:\n- `a != b` returns the same value as `!(a == b)`\n- `a == a` is true\n- `a == b` implies `b == a`\n- `a == b && b == c` implies `a == c`\n\nThe first two requirements are not true for floating point types using this implementation. It's separate from `Eq` _because_ `Eq` is implemented for floating point types via the hardware comparison operation. It's also not a correct implementation of `TotalOrd` for similar reasons.\n\nWhat should `cmp` for two `NaN` values return? At the moment it's saying they are equal. However, the `TotalEq` implementation is saying they are not equal. It's also treating `-0.0` and `0.0` as equal but they are not equivalent, so it's breaking some basic assumptions about equality/ordering.\n",
