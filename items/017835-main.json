  "body": "This allows the user to specify which asm syntax is desired for\n`--emit=asm`\n\nI also considered an environment variable to let it lurk under the covers a bit more but this seemed most optimal for a generic interface.\n\nI asked on irc and didn't hear anything back so I figured I'd just go ahead and do it and amend if necessary. I was torn between a toplevel option and lurking it in behind `-Z` or similar.\n\nI have some concerns that would hold this back from being merged:\n- ~~What does this do on arches that can't intel? (my intuition is that `llc` will barf horribly but I have no idea how rustc will deal with that)~~ Haven't tested on arm (rustc builds are /very/ expensive), but unless anyone objects I don't think this should block.\n- Is the toplevel option ok?\n- Do I need to add tests for this? It seems like it should have them, but I couldn't find any preexisting. If not I will fumble through them.\n",
