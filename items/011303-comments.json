Option's representation is so dependent upon it's contents, and I'm seeing FFI user's want to deal with various other different Option types from C. Personally, I do not think it's a best practice to use Rust pointers in the FFI and always convert to unsafe pointers. I would not be opposed to keeping Option<pointer> a struct and telling people to leave it out of the FFI.\n",
