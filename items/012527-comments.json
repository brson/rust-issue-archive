    "body": "@edwardw just to be clear, the patch you made is pretty reasonable, it's just that I've been moving responsibility for these sorts of checks to the borrow checker, which is probably not clear from the code. I think I didn't do a good job of finishing the job of simplifying liveness.\n\nAnyway the problem there is that the borrow checker classifies all expressions into assignees or uses, but this is _both_, so we need to change the move data to have a 3-way classification.\n\nIt'd also be nice to remove all span_err's from liveness and make sure that my assertion that liveness is purely about warnings is actually true. Maybe there are other oversights in the borrow checker!\n",
