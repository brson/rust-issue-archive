  "body": "This is a fix for #20300 though as a side-sweep it fixes a number of stack overflows because it integrates cycle detection into the conversion process. I didn't go through and retest everything.\n\nThe tricky part here is that in some cases we have to go find the information we need from the AST -- we can't use the converted form of the where-clauses because we often have to handle something like `T::Item` _while converting the where-clauses themselves_. Since this is also not a fixed-point process we can't just try and keep trying to find the best order. So instead I modified the `AstConv` interface to allow you to request the bounds for a type parameter; we'll then do a secondary scan of the where-clauses to figure out what we need. This may create a cycle in some cases, but we have code to catch that.\n\nAnother approach that is NOT taken by this PR would be to \"convert\" `T::Item` into a form that does not specify what trait it's using. This then kind of defers the problem of picking the trait till later. That might be a good idea, but it would make normalization and everything else much harder, so I'm holding off on that (and hoping to find a better way for handling things like `i32::T`).\n\nThis PR also removes \"most of\" the `bounds` struct from `TypeParameterDef`. Still a little ways to go before `ParamBounds` can be removed entirely -- it's used for supertraits, for example (though those really ought to be converted, I think, to a call to `get_type_parameter_bounds` on `Self` from within the trait definition).\n\ncc @jroesch \n\nFixes #20300 \n",
