    "body": "Hi - I'm a SystemTap developer, and I've created a prototype of our flavor of SDT for Rust on Linux:\n\n[Rust SDT `probe!()` macro](https://gist.github.com/cuviper/fd016ad0f4cee4d87914)\n\nThis would be very similar in concept to dtrace USDT, but AIUI the implementations are quite different.  Conceivably, dtrace platforms could implement the same macro with different guts though, which is why I decided to share mine here.\n\nThe macro inserts just a single NOP in the code, then ELF notes describe the probe and its arguments.  SystemTap knows how to parse these, of course, and I gave a tiny example in the gist.  GDB 7.5 gained support for SDT too, with `info probes` to list them and `break -probe name` to place a breakpoint.  You can also see the probe metadata using `readelf -n`.\n\nI'm very new to rust, but the `asm!` and `concat!` macros made this fairly straightforward.  Solving types more completely might take some expert help though - I made notes in the file about that.\n\nThanks, and any feedback is welcome!\n",

    "body": "Does it make sense to be a separate library even if core parts will be using it?  That's the only reason I thought it should be in libstd.  I'm also not sure how a macro-only library would function.  Ideally, you'd want it to be present just for compilation, but there's nothing that needs to be linked at runtime.  (But perhaps other platforms might need runtime stuff.)\n\nFor the `asm` feature, yes I would hope the library hosting `probe!` could mask that detail, but I understand if that's yet to be handled.\n",
