    "body": "Indenting the second part of the multi-line doc-comment with four spaces apparently tells markdown that we want multiple paragraphs in a single list item, but it looks weird in the `.rs` file and then there's paragraph elements in some list items and not others, which also looks weird (and inconsistent between markdown implementations):\n\n<h4>Variants</h4><ul><li><code>DefaultScheduler</code> - Run task on the default scheduler</li><li><code>CurrentScheduler</code> - Run task on the current scheduler</li><li><code>ExistingScheduler(Scheduler)</code> - Run task on a specific scheduler</li><li><p><code>PlatformThread</code> - Tasks are scheduled on the main OS thread</p> The main OS thread is the thread used to launch the runtime which, in most cases, is the process's initial thread as created by the OS.</li><li><code>SingleThreaded</code> - All tasks run in the same OS thread</li><li><code>ThreadPerCore</code> - Tasks are distributed among available CPUs</li><li><code>ThreadPerTask</code> - Each task runs in its own OS thread</li><li><p><code>ManualThreads(uint)</code> - Tasks are distributed among a fixed number of OS threads</p></li></ul>\n\nI'm not sure what the desired html output here is in the first place (maybe paragraphs for every list item whether and css to squeeze them together?), but I suspect the doc comment is okay as it is and rustdoc ought to change.\n",
