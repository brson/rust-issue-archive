    "body": "The RFC talks about how 'fallout' within the standard library is minimal, but doesn't provide any information about how we are supposed to update our own code to make it work. I know that at the moment it is only a warning but in the future it will become an error so I think its important to tell people.\n\nThe RFC seems to suggest that writing `trait Foo for ?Sized { ... }` is possible but under `rustc 1.4.0-nightly (e822a18ae 2015-08-16)` that won't compile.\n\nWould you please be able to detail how users can convert existing code?\n\nMy extremely simplified example shows the issue: http://is.gd/1gPnQP\n\nThanks very much if you could help with this.\n",
