  "body": "Hello! \n\nI've been working towards a libsyntax without panics. See:\nhttp://internals.rust-lang.org/t/changing-libsyntax-to-use-result-instead-of-panic/1670\n\nThis patch changes the internals of parser.rs to use Result<> rather than panicing. It keeps the following old-style panicing functions as a facade:\nparse_expr, parse_item, parse_pat, parse_arm, parse_ty, parse_stmt\n\nI left these functions because I wasn't sure what to do about the quote_\\* macros or how many syntax-extensions would break if these and quoting macros returned Result.\n\nThe gyst of the rest of the patch is:\n- Functions in parse/parser.rs return PResult<> rather than panicing\n- Other functions in libsyntax call panic! explicitly if they rely on panicing behaviour.\n- I added a macro 'panictry!()' to act as scaffolding for callers while converting panicing functions. (This does the same as 'unwrap()' but is easier to grep for and turn into try!()).\n\nAm I on the right track?  I'd quite like to get something merged soon as keeping this rebased in the face of libsyntax changes is a lot of work. Please let me know what changes you'd like to see to make this happen.\n\nThanks!, Phil\n",
