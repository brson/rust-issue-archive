Although, there are places where I would like proper rendering ([example](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/rand/distributions/gamma/enum.Gamma.html)).\n\nI'm sure other people will wish to use rustdoc with rendered mathematics, so it would still be neat to at least have `--include-in-header mathjax-header.template` and `--include-after-body mathjax-after.template` that inserts the contents of those files into the final output, or even a `--mathjax` flag (or something) that does the mathjax insertion automatically, although that might be regarded as too specialised.\n",
