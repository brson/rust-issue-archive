Pros: each implementation of the `Read` trait can choose the most efficient implementation for its `skip()`.  If repeated `read()` folowed by discarding a buffer is the only way to do so, we can simply implement `skip()` on top of `skip_by_read()`.  Cons: because Rust trait doesn't have the notion of private/protected methods, exposing an auxiliary method `skip_by_read()` is a bit ugly.\n",
