    "body": "This issue still exists, but I would consider it partly by design. Right now, rustdoc will create a \"Reexports\" section that prints each `pub use` that is merely a re-export of something that's already documented somewhere else. ([Here's a stable link to an example, the `core::ptr` module in 1.19.0.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.19.0/core/ptr/)) If you want to inline the documentation, you can tag the `pub use` with `#[doc(inline)]`. I haven't tested whether this includes the item in the search index with that path, but i suspect it will. Comically enough, both the `intrinsics::write_bytes` and the `ptr::write_bytes` appear in the search index in std, implying that re-exporting the module just sees the `pub use` as a regular item.\r\n\r\nI'll keep this issue open, if only for \"add reexports into the search index under their new paths as well as their original ones\".",
