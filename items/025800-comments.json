    "body": "A couple friends and I dug into this issue as part of a mini-sprint. _We'd love a mentor or some guidance to work on this_.\n\nAs we understand it right now:\n- Unicode case conversions are done using raw text tables from [unicode.org](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt)\n- The raw tables are exported as rust slices in [tables.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f14d289d71fd8e4956e7214bda3af15cd50898fe/src/librustc_unicode/tables.rs) using a python script [unicode.py](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f14d289d71fd8e4956e7214bda3af15cd50898fe/src/etc/unicode.py)\n- The current `to_uppercase` methods use a binary search over the single character conversion tables ignoring the multiple character `compatibility_table`\n\nSo what needs to happen then is:\n- Either join the two tables or search both of them. \n- `to_upper` and `to_lower` in [tables.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f14d289d71fd8e4956e7214bda3af15cd50898fe/src/librustc_unicode/tables.rs) then need to be changed to return a slice rather than a single `char`\n- `to_uppercase` and `to_lowercase` need to use that slice for the iterators it returns\n\n_Is that an accurate summary?_\n\nAlso, we noted there are [several external but related crates for unicode](http://unicode-rs.github.io/) but couldn't find any indication on whether these crates were moving into the standard lib or whether the standard lib was moving out. \n",

    "body": "@bitborn that all sounds pretty good! I think we may not want to encode the exact return value of each character (that's a lot of space). It'll be a balancing act to figure out how to encode the data on unicode.org in as compact a form as possible but still having a fast lookup for case conversions.\n",
