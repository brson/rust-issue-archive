    "body": "struct inheritance, single inheritance...\ncoming from C++, I've found myself missing simple single inheritance in rust.. the straightforward ability to have multiple structs with the same data prefix, no extra complexity for multiple inheritance with virtual bases. (i wouldn't ask for multiple inheritance with extra indirection going on)\n\nI got the impression some of the rust compiler sourcecode is slightly complicated by its absence, eg situtaions where nodes share the same fields. (spans).. see spanned<T>, then a series of duplicate symbols with _ prefixes like variant_ =spanned<variant> etc .. maybe i'm overlooking something\nIMO single inheritance is simple from a low level perspective, just different records sharing the same data at the same offsets.. used to do it in ASM.\n\nWould it create complex interactions eg with generics, inference, impls, traits ?\n",
