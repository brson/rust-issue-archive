    "body": "I don't think adding an arbitrary limit hard-wired limit is a good way to work around this issue. The number of channels used by an application will vary, as will the available memory. Failure is better than running out of memory, but this is just going to offer a false sense of correctness. Increasing the size of the API and the complexity of the semantics isn't free.\n\nI think using the unbounded channels simply needs to be restricted to cases where there's a known external bound that's viewed as acceptable. The standard library should offer true bounded channels with various ways of handling a full channel (blocking, blocking with timeout, asynchronous, dropping new messages, dropping old messages) and then there's no reason to add hacks here.\n\nEither way, as an API change that's potentially controversial I think this should be discussed.\n",
