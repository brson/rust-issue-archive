    "body": "The most likely problem here is a stack overflow (since we don't currently have segmented stacks), and although you don't have a very deep callstack, since the struct is so big maybe the call frames are huge. Try running with RUST_MIN_STACK=20000000 and seeing if it helps. If so then you can increase the amount of stack used programmatically.\n\nI'm not sure why gdb thinks the top frames are called ?? though - not sure if that could be a symptom of stack overflow or not.\n",
