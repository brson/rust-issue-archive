  "body": "There are now only half-a-dozen or so functions left `std::str` that should be methods.\n\nHighlights:\n- `.substr` was removed, since most of the uses of it in the code base were actually incorrect (it had a weird mixing of a byte index and a unicode character count), adding `.slice_chars` if one wants to handle characters, and the normal `.slice` method to handle bytes.\n- Code duplication between the two impls for `connect` and `concat` was removed via a new `Str` trait, that is purely designed to allow an explicit -> `&str` conversion (`.as_slice()`)\n- Deconfuse the 5 different functions for converting to `[u8]` (3 of which had actually incorrect documentation: implying that they didn't have the null terminator), into 3: `as_bytes` (all strings), `as_bytes_with_null` (`&'static str`, `@str` and `~str`) and `as_bytes_with_null_consume` (`~str`). None of these allocate, unlike the old versions.\n\n(cc @thestinger)\n",
