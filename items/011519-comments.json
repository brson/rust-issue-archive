    "body": "Big -1 for symbolic operators.  Having a wide-open symbol space makes libraries unapproachable.  It's not completely terrible in Haskell b/c of Hoogle and a community that generally has decent taste; it's a disaster in Scala, though.  \n\nRust's current approach of a specific set of operators that can be defined for new types is a good compromise and has worked well enough for Python and C++.\n\nAs for named operators w/ fixities and precedence, I just don't get the benefit.  Ok, it looks nicer sometimes, but it makes it harder to understand exactly what the code is doing unless you use it frequently enough to memorize this particular special case's quirks.  I've never seen code where I thought the use of custom operators made it worth the overhead of trying to grok them.\n\nIf you really want to write DSLs for people to bang their head against, Rust has macros.\n",
