The situation it's protecting against is when N senders simultaneously see a disconnected state. They will all see this state by incrementing the shared count, but consequently only one will see the exact value of DISCONNECTED. They _all_ need to realize that the port is disconnected, however.\n\nThe fudge number is my guess that it's basically impossible for that number of threads to be pre-empted after they see (cnt < DISCONNECTED + FUDGE) and before they reset the count back to DISCONNECTED.\n\nDoes that make sense?

    "body": "Why not set it to `int::max_value / 2`, so that all values between `int::min_value` and `int::min_value/2` represent disconnection?\n\nOr, IMHO better, test for `<= DISCONNECTED` instead of `DISCONNECTED + FUDGE` and set `DISCONNECTED` to `int::min_value / 2`.\n\nThe problem of 1024 is that, although very unlikely in normal conditions, there can be more than 1024 tasks, and they can all be simultaneously in that race window (BTW, setting a debugger breakpoint that stops only the hitting thread on that instruction will guarantee that the race condition always happens).\n",
