(how do display all of it)\n- This would involve building a cache of information that's sendable because the tcx is destroyed after compilation (it's not sendable across tasks).\n\nI would imagine this would just query all types ahead of time and then place little badges on the relevant pages about what qualities the type has (although again, with generics I'm not sure how this would work).\n",
