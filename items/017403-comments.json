This is good because I've been looking for breakage that results from this, so I'm glad to have some concrete examples.\n\nIn particular I suspect the problem is that we currently consider the closure region bound to be its enclosing expression, which is patently wrong (#3696). There is a better algorithm for handling this described in a comment but I haven't gotten around to implementing it. I was waiting to look into this until the dust form @pcwalton's SEME region work settled, which seems to have happened. So now is the time, I guess. :)\n",

    "body": "My grasp of the region code is tenuous, but I think the interesting bit that causes the desugared version to be rejected is in `link_reborrowed_region`, where the mutability of `F::x` causes it to recurse and link regions higher up in the deref path to the region of the reborrow.  In particular, this causes the region of `self.x` to become bounded by that of `self`, which creates a set of constraints with no solution.  If `F::x` is changed to an immutable ref and the rest of the code updated accordingly, the extra link is not created and the code compiles, but of course this is perfectly sound.\n\nIt should be possible to make it handle the upvar in a similar way.  I've been experimenting with a quick hack, and it seems to fix the simple unsound case above and pass unit tests, but it doesn't deal with the fact that the mutability of an upvar can be changed by later borrows or nested closures that have yet to be processed.  It also produces really poor diagnostics.\n\nCan anyone with deeper knowledge of regionck confirm if I'm on the right track here?\n",
