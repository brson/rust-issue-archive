    "body": "Yes, this is the same bug as #3429. The underlying issue in both of them is that the initial filtering of relevant methods is not precise enough, i.e. that it treats impls such as the following as being applicable to each type, regardless whether it implements `Bar` or not:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo {\n    fn foo(&self);\n}\n\ntrait Bar {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\nimpl <T: Bar> Foo for T {\n    fn foo(&self) { self.bar(); }\n}\n```\n\n(This filtering currently happens in `librustc/middle/typeck/check/method.rs` in the method `is_relevant`)\n\nIn this issue, this causes a surprising error for a type that is not connected to the relevant traits at all, in issue #3429, this causes a conflict of multiple methods, even though only one of them should be applicable.\n",
