The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @brson (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

For example this same error will happen if two threads call `create_dir` concurrently, but I don't think we should be adding a check there either.\n\nConcurrent operations can't always be detected and when they do happen on the filesystem it often indicates that something else is going awry and needs to be kicked up further. As an example, the [boost implementation of this function](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/blob/a682eaa476cf0b4e992884d32dd2ddcfb0b6b1aa/src/operations.cpp#L938) has the same semantics as this where the error isn't inspected on the way out.\n\nOverall I think that we don't have a concrete enough handle on what a race is for a function like this that I don't think we should add an extra check after-the-fact.\n",

I\nagree that this affects the case where two threads are calling\ncreate_for_all, as well as the less likely case where another program (or\ninstance of the same program) creates the directory.\n\nIn any case, like with mkdir -p, I value this kind of function because it\nbehaves in an idempotent manner, and dislike this race because it violates\nthat idempotency property, in that it means that it can fail even when the\ndirectory exists.\n\nFor some background, the reason I discovered this problem was a set of test\nfunctions that I wrote which each started by creating the same test\ndirectory so they would be easy to clean up. I was surprised to see\noccasional failures due to the create_dir_all failing due to the directory\nalready existing.
