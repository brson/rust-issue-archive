    "body": "I have to admit, it's a bit baffling that the \"intro\" path (Syntax and Semantics) is the one that requires you to jump out of TOC order of the book.  When you get to the decision point, your only clue is:\n\n> Welcome! This section has a few tutorials that teach you Rust through building projects. You\u2019ll get a high-level overview, but we\u2019ll skim over the details.\n> \n> If you\u2019d prefer a more \u2018from the ground up\u2019-style experience, check out Syntax and Semantics.\n\nThe fact that the path labeled \"tutorials\" is apparently the \"throw you in the deep end\" path is very unclear.  I would generally expect that the linear in-order path through the book's TOC is the friendliest and most self-contained intro to the language.\n\nFurthermore, it's very strange that chapter 4 relies on a lot of knowledge that isn't introduced until chapter 5.  I think the book could benefit from chapter 3 including a heavily abridged version of chapter 5 which introduces some of the important syntax early on without needing to crawl through every detail.\n",

    "body": "> It is literally above the fold on the first page of the book. Not sure how else to make the relationship even more clear.\n\nI'm not seeing that clarity.  The description of the two choices on the first page still leaves me with the impression that \"Learn Rust\" is going to be the easy path, and \"Syntax and Semantics\" is going to be thorough technical descriptions of every language feature (this is reinforced by a glance at the subheadings in chapter 5).  Many programming intro books give you a choice between the soft, example-laden ease-in and the dry technical slog through more reference-like material, and I think perhaps the root issue (and the reason people complain either way you order it) is that it _sounds_ like this is the choice you're offering, but it's not.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, here is the relevant text:\n\n> \u2018Learn Rust\u2019 if you want to dive in with a project, or \u2018Syntax and Semantics\u2019 if you prefer to start small, and learn a single concept thoroughly before moving onto the next.\n\nI read this as \"follow 'Learn Rust' if you want your hand held through some sample code\" and \"follow 'Syntax and Semantics' if you prefer to learn a language by sitting down and reading the reference book.\"\n\nPlease keep in mind that at this point, I'm intentionally trying to look at this from a no-prior-knowledge point of view to help you understand what's frustrating people.  Despite these small bumps, I find the book to be an excellent intro; I just think this navigational issue could be improved to get more people to successfully use the book.\n",
