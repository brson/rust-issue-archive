  "body": "When calling a function, or anything with nested parens,\ndefault to cindent's indent. The least error-prone way I\ncould think of identifying this is to look for a line\nthat ends with a ',', as well as a non-zero number of\nany character except parens before the comma, and\nthen an open paren.\n\nThis will overlap with the previous rule accounting for\nfunction definitions, but that should be fine because\nit is also using cindent.\n",
