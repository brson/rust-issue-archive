Now we just resolve each copy of the region variable\nto its lowest name each time (we resolve the region variable to its lowest\nname, rather than to its unify-table name to avoid the risk of\nthe unify-table name changing infinitely many times. That may be\nnot a problem in practice, but I am not sure of it).\n",
