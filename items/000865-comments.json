    "body": "I think it should be an error, but I do have one wrinkle. Currently, tests need to be exported in order to run, so you might have a test module:\n\n```\nmod my {\n\n  export test;\n\n  #[test]\n  mod test {\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen compiled normally, mod test doesn't exist, so it would be an error. I'd like to fix this by giving tests some magic (#721) and not requiring them to be exported. But fwiw, this isn't actually a problem we're running into currently.\n",
