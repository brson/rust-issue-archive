    "body": "In a similar vein, it would also be nice if the compiler says what types are expected when it runs into an invalid type for main.\n\nRight now if the main function is defined as returning int then rustc says:\n\n```\nhello.rs:4:0: 6:1 error: wrong type in main function: found `native fn([str]) -> int`\n```\n\nPerhaps it could say something like:\n\n```\nhello.rs:4:0: 6:1 error: wrong type in main function: found `native fn([str]) -> \nint` but expecting `native fn([str]) -> ()` or `native fn() -> ()`\n```\n",
