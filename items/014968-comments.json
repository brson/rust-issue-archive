    "body": "As I've stated a few times, `Equiv` is a bad interface for this because it's not actually general enough. Once the new closures land, the maps can simply expose methods taking a closure for equality comparisons (`HashMap`) or ordering comparisons (`TreeMap`). The convenience methods from the `Map` trait can then be implemented as a wrapper around these methods _with zero overhead_ (unlike the closures of today). The `Equiv` trait can then simply be removed because it won't have a use case anymore.\n",
