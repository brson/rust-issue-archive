    "body": "@P1start \n\n> It\u2019s not immediately obvious (at least to me) that \u2018here\u2019 refers to the line/column mentioned at the start of the message.\n\nI suspect there are variations on \"(defined here)\" that would be generally intelligible.\n\nAnother issue: When you have long paths (which I often do), then switching from having the path at the front of the line to the end of the line as suggested by your design will break the flow of the text.\n\nMoving it to the end of the line forces the reader to scan back with their eye past the wall of paths that is normally there.    (As you say yourself, your own eyes often just skip over the wall of paths anyway...)\n\n```\n<longerpathmoredemonstrativeofoutputwhencompilingsomeprograms>:4:10: 4:13 error: unresolved name `bar`\n<longerpathmoredemonstrativeofoutputwhencompilingsomeprograms>:4     foo!(bar);\n                                                                          ^~~\nnote: in expansion of `foo!`, defined at <longerpathmoredemonstrativeofoutputwhencompilingsomeprograms>:1:1: 1:42\nnote: expansion site: <longerpathmoredemonstrativeofoutputwhencompilingsomeprograms>:4:5: 4:15\n```\n\n(Admittedly, this is a bit of a strawman since the same problem arises whenever one issues an error without a span, i.e. using just `cx.err` rather than `cx.span_err`.  But our usual response in those cases is to encourage one to find an appropriate span to use; here, we would be codifying the non wall-of-path output...)\n\n---\n\nAnyway, I would not block this PR personally if others want to land it; I just wanted to point out the alternative smaller revision to the output.\n",
