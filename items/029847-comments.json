    "body": "I'm nominating this issue for discussion at the next libs meeting. I think we should hammer out our allocator vagueness story. In particular, our docs are being highly conservative by claiming that Vec::with_capacity, Vec::shrink_to_fit, and Vec::reserve_exact may produce a larger capacity than requested. To my knowledge, this is in anticipation of:\n- interesting optimizations\n- local allocators\n\nThe original reservations here were, I believe, established by strcat long long ago, before I even started working on the project. strcat obviously understands allocators a lot, so I'm assuming there was some important insight here, and not just a vague reservation. That said I might be mistaken. If anyone knows the background here, I'd really appreciate chiming in.\n\nCC @rust-lang/libs @pcwalton @pnkfelix \n",

    "body": "> I'm also curious if people consider it more important for Vec to behave in a concrete way (perfect capacity) or use as much bonus space as possible.\n\nI vote for \"bonus space\". Otherwise, it would be necessary to provide an API to calculate a capacity that doesn't waste the \"bonus space.\" This eliminates unnecessary reallocations. I see no concrete advantage to having `capacity()` return exactly what was requested.\n",

    "body": "I assume that the documentation for `deallocate` is based on the one from jemalloc. We might want to make the requirements somewhat different (for example, when deallocating we might require the same size used when allocating) in order to also accomodate other allocators.\n\nI think a good compromise might be to have `with_capacity`, `reserve_exact` and `shrink_to_fit` use \"exact\" amounts of memory, while the other allocation methods would use the usual allocation policy+excess capacity. `shrink_to_fit` would then guarantee `len() == capacity()` upon return; the other two methods would guarantee that the capacity is exactly as requested. I think these methods should be sufficient for most use cases where accurate control over the size of the allocation is needed.\n",
