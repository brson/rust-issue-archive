    "body": "@arielb1 points out that inserting a new call to `abort_if_errors` would not be ideal, since it will continue to cause us to abort, when we really want to allow compilation to keep going and find _more_ (independent) errors\n\nThe real problem here, @arielb1 points out, is that the guard on the `span_bug` here is only checking the `tcx.sess` to see if any errors have been emitted, but the `fcx` itself may also have errors registered that are not reflected in the `tcx.sess`.\n\nUpdate: On further investigation, I am not 100% sure the analysis in this comment is quite right. E.g. I do not yet see how one can have errors registered in the `fcx` that are not reflected in the `tcx.sess`; stay tuned...\n",

    "body": "@ebfull after discussion with @arielb1 on IRC, I think we can indeed avoid many of the ICE's, not by changing mem_categorization, but rather by restructuring the type checker to do high-level signature-matching checks (e.g. that trait impls define all necessary items from the trait definitions) before checking any bodies.  I have a prototype that does that in development right now.\n\nWe may indeed still want to put in this PR, but i am not certain of that yet; I, like you, would prefer to get rid of this ICE entirely.  (And indeed, the path to get there may still involve changes to mem_categorization; I am not sure yet.)\n",
