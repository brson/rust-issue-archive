  "body": "rust-mode.el recently started highlighting keywords that were substrings of identifiers. Identifiers such as `xyz_type` would have `type` highlighted, which isn't normal. This patch re-introduces `_` as a word constituent, so that keywords following a `_` don't get syntax highlighted as keywords. Fixes issue #20422\n",
