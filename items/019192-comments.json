    "body": "In general the `*Prelude` traits are not intended to be generalized over, they're purely intended to provide the ability to define inherent methods on language-defined types. Could you elaborate a little more on the motivation for this patch? You mention that `[T]`, `Vec<T>` and `CVec<T>` all benefit, but `[T]` and `Vec<T>` should both benefit today to to the existing impl and the `Deref` impl on `Vec`. I suspect that the `CVec<T>` type needs to itself be revisited and redesigned, so it may not be the best type to optimize for right now.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I eventually found a minimum change to generalize the existing `impl` for `Vec<Str>` to `AsSlice<Str>` was the best.  User-defined types implementing `AsSlice<Str>` will also benefit from `StrVector` methods.\n\nGranted, it's only one method call away (`mycontainer.as_slice().concat()`.)  But since this change won't break anything and is an incremental refine, I think it's worth getting into the stdlib.\n",
