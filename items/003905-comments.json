    "body": "Wow, I should pay more attention to these threads :)\n\nThe original behavior (closed pipes return true) was intentional on my part. The rational is that `peek` returns true when something has happened on the pipe that you might care about. For example, if we had a loop that kept using `peek` to test for a message, we'd want to know if the pipe closed so we could terminate the loop.\n\nThat said, I can see the argument for the new behavior, so I'm fine if people would rather it be the other way. Perhaps we could have peek that returns an enum of `MessageWaiting`, `Terminated` or `NoData`.\n",
