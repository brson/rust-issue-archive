    "body": "`find_mut`, `get_mut`, and `borrow_mut` to me seem fine. Those are verbs, not nouns. `mut_iter`, `mut_slice`, etc are nouns. So the former is saying \"do this thing, mutably\". The latter is saying \"return this mutable thing\".\n\n`front_mut` and `back_mut` seem like the latter, which suggests they should be `mut_front` and `mut_back`.\n\n`mut_split_at` is an interesting case, as \"split\" is both verb and noun. I think it's correct as-is. `split_mut_at` and `split_at_mut` both suggest there's a non-mutable `split_at`, which there isn't. I think it's ok to read this as \"return a mutable split at (index)\". There's also a parallel between mutable split and mutable slice.\n",
