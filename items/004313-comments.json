    "body": "@graydon Added some tests, and found that I had met the \"'negative' unsigned numbers act strangely\" bug. \n\nPreviously, calling `for uint::range_step(10, 0, -1) |_| { .. }` didn't iterate at all (the expected behaviour is iterating over `10,9,...,1`), because `-1 > 0` for unsigned numbers and so it didn't detect that it should be iterating downwards. Fixed by breaking out the single `range_step` function into 2 functions iterating in a specific direction.\n\nI'm slightly uncomfortable about having a different API for signed vs unsigned (i.e. `range_step` vs `range_step_up` & `range_step_down`), but I'm not sure there is a better resolution.\n",
