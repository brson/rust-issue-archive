That will hopefully be fixed soon.\n",

    "body": "Those many modules are just there to demonstrate the many aspects of this lacking feature. If you try to compile you'll get compile errors in the native modules, but not in the matching non-native ones. \n\n Yes, I can reference types from the non-native module in the native one, but that means I'll need to use  2 modules, one native and another non-native wrapper module. It would be far handier if that wasn't needed, and if const, enum and type would work also in native modules.\n\nThe enum problem you mention is also a bit  of a bummer, but that's not what I was getting at. Anyway, thanks for listening to me!\n",
