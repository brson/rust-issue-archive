    "body": "> You mean that fn main should be pub fn main\n\nyes\n\n> Is that true in general for tests\n\nJust for the `run-pass` suite. The reason is that we have a `check-fast` suite on windows which basically concatenates all the tests together, and for resolve to work each `main` function must be `pub` to be usable. See #12304 for removing `check-fast`. (this suite is only run on bsd for a slow aws bot and windows for slow spawn times).\n\n> How do you recognise from those logs that check-fast is the issue\n\nThe bsd bot is complaining about `error: function main is private` with some weird `t_XXX::main()` expression, which is what the test concatenator is generating.\n\n> And does this mean I should run make check and make check-fast before PRing\n\nPerhaps, I always forget `pub fn main`, but for super exhaustiveness `check-fast` will catch this bug.\n",
