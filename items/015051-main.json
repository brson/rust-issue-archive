  "body": "This implementation does have the minor issue of not handling things correctly when a codepoint is split across multiple writes or reads, but its better than not having unicode support at all.\n\nAdds a Windows specific struct `WindowsTTY` in `libnative` and make `tty_open` create that struct on Windows. Adds needed functions and constants to `c_win32.rs`.\n\nLibuv still needs to be updated before #15028 can be closed.\n",
