    "body": "I'm a little worried about this logic for a few reasons:\n- This is basically an entirely new implementation, there's essentially no connection to what Clang does. This is generally a red flag, but I also never found a reason for why Clang does what it does, so it may not be that bad.\n- It looks like the way this is written will force us to update the compiler each time a new SDK is released. That may not be able to ever avoid, however.\n- It's very difficult to test this. I'd like to at least try to poke around a bit locally, but unfortunately my VM is offline.\n\nI think that if this passes manual testing that we should land this, however, as fixing compatibility with the most recent VS is likely more important for now. It'd be great, however, to get a definitive answer on what this logic should be (or perhaps providing a better guarantee that it'll work), but I unfortunately don't know how to do that :(.\n\ncc @vadimcn \n",

    "body": "Currently you can already override the entire system by just executing the proper vcvars bat file causing this code to back off and just trust everything is setup correctly and it'll work. Since we never know what sort of changes will occur in new versions of VS (such as VS 2015 adding the UCRT and the Windows 10 SDK both of which required new logic), I think it's better to not try to guess and just add support for it once someone can actually test it out.\n\nAs for testing this, I have VS 2015 2013 and 2012, and by commenting out some of the versions in that VS version array I could test how it handles all three versions and it works perfectly. It falls back to the 8.1 SDK for 2015 when there's no 10 SDK, it uses the 8.1 SDK for 2013 and it uses the 8 SDK for 2012. It still would be nice to get people testing it on other setups though as I've done all my testing on 64-bit Windows 10 only.\n\nThis code should work fine for new releases of the Win10 SDK as I've borrowed the exact logic from vcvars to find the newest Win10 SDK. Considering Microsoft said that Windows 10 is their final version of Windows, this means we may be in the clear with regards to that. New versions of VS however are still a possibility although the user can always just execute vcvars to setup the environment themselves.\n\nThe reason I rewrote this was because I felt like it wasn't robust enough. This implementation should very closely mirror what vcvars does and I'm more willing to trust what Microsoft does than what clang does, at least with regards to Microsoft's own software.\n",

The CL compiler version is same as the one shipped with VS2015 Update 1.\n\nIt seems like this CLI-base is in preparation for Server 2016 and Nano Server feature called \"containers\". Also Windows team is working to provide \"docker containers\" (to bridge with their \"native containers\") GUI/CLI, where installing VS won't be a viable option: https://github.com/docker/docker/pulls/jhowardmsft.\n",

    "body": "> what clang does, \n\nI know at least detecting Windows 10 SDK (which is now at a new location the first time in a long time compared to its predecessors) hasn't done correctly by gyp, the build system favored by Chrome and node.js native modules projects. Initially gyp was developed because cmake was considered not meeting the requirement. Chrome guys are now moving away (or already) from their own gyp to another build system by Google called [gn](https://www.chromium.org/developers/gn-build-configuration) which seems to have fixed this SDK detection issue (but it is definitely in amateur hour to be fully trusted). \n",

So, I thought to myself, I will do this properly this time. Thus I threw out the old code, dug deep into `vcvarsqueryregistry.bat`, and made this PR.\n",
