    "body": "Ok, so `std::io::stdout()` will always hit the process-wide FD 1 (not task-local), whereas the functions in `std::io::stdio` will write to a task-local \"stdout\" which could be redirected at spawn time.  Perhaps the task-local \"stdout\" should have a different name?  Otherwise this could get rather confusing.  I think people will expect the term \"stdout\" to always refer to the process global version.  \"Task default output\" maybe?\n\nIf the task-local one is still going to be named \"stdout\", then I think the documentation will need to be updated in a lot of places to make it explicit which \"stdout\" is being used.  For instance, the documentation of `std::io::stdio::println` refers to \"the stdout of the current process\"--but that's no longer the case, now it's \"the stdout of the current task\" (and probably an explanation of how that is not the same thing as the stdout of the current process.)\n\nOnce that distinction is clear, it's natural to assume that child processes will inherit the process global FD, so I see why that's not a bug.  It's easy enough to capture the output and print it to the task's \"stdout\".\n",

It should be cheap enough to be able to do that for tests, it would also capture all sorts of outputs and would let us to avoid having that weird thread-local stdout overwrite code we have now.\n",

It is just \"inconsistent\".\r\n\r\nFWIW, there will always be a way \"around\" it (talking to `/dev/tty`, using fd 1, etc.). Unless there's some mangling going on under `cfg(test)`, what kinds of effects would `std::io::stdout()` checking some TLS structure add to non-test code?\r\n\r\nFor child processes, there would need to be some file descriptor/handle juggling in `std::process` to detect `cfg(test)` and relocate the file descriptors if not otherwise set. This also leaves things like `tokio::process` in the dark unless the `test` crate grows some APIs to use (and stabilizes them).",

Note that this also gives a way to guarantee bypassing any such capturing (assuming fd 1 isn't closed\u2026which makes me think \"what is the behavior on a closed fd 1 here? how about read-only?\"). Similarly for `std::process`, bypassing may or may not be wanted in different contexts. That sounds like API design and, again, dependent upon the `test` crate being stabilized anyways.",
