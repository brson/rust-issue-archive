I was trying to unify the representation of structs, tuple structs, and all the enum variants behind the scenes (so they all followed one path on their way to trans), but tuple structs and variants have a special case where they can get passed around as callable values and that conflicted with what I was trying to do.  I'm planning on trying again with a different design that doesn't nuke the callable stuff but due to lack of time it'll be a while before it lands.  Consequently, if someone else wants to pick up this bug they should go for it.\n",
