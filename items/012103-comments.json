    "body": "What @bill-myers said, there is a race with fork() calls in other threads.\n\nFreeBSD 10 and non-ancient Linux have system calls that atomically set the close-on-exec flag: open(O_CLOEXEC), connect(SOCK_CLOEXEC), accept4(), etc.\n\nOn Linux, those system calls appeared around 2.6.27.  That's not _that_ long ago: RHEL 5, the de facto baseline for enterprise support, ships 2.6.18 and is supported until 2017.  Having a hard dependency on a newer kernel will be problematic for many enterprise users.\n\nWhat libuv does is try the newer system calls first and fall back to the old broken-by-design system calls when they're not supported.\n\nApropos walking the file descriptor table with getdtablesize(), that helps somewhat but it's easy to subvert by lowering RLIMIT_NOFILE: any open file descriptors above the new limit remain open and will leak into the new process.\n",
