A simple Pid for each task and a syntax for sending and receiving seems much simpler to use.\n",

It is very common to have ports that are only used for a small set of messages, and there is no reason to pollute the general type of the task mailbox for that.\n\nAnyway, the `spawn_listener()` routine that @brson added fulfills the need of \"launch an actor with a single mailbox without a lot of fuss\":\n\n```\nspawn_listener {|port|\n    while true {\n        alt comm::recv(port) {\n               ....\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n",

    "body": "I think everybody agrees that in the common case you just want to launch actors with single built-in channels and send messages directly to them without worrying about separate ports. So far we haven't been able to come up with a satisfactory way to do so within our type system, nor have we been willing to commit to losing ports and channels as independent types.\n\nI do like that ports and channels are well separated from the task API. This rewrite of the task API didn't require touching the comm API, which was very nice. If tasks were mailboxes then that wouldn't be the case.\n\nMy personal opinion is that, once we have classes, traits and possibly the `any~` type, we should try to design an `actor` trait and iface based on Scala that provides a more convenient actor API, then promote the use of actors and consider tasks, ports and channels to be lower-level details.\n",

The first is the code example for setting up bidirectional communication:\n\n```\nlet po = comm::port();\nlet ch = comm::chan(po);\nlet ch = spawn_listener {|po|\n    // Now the child has a port called 'po' to read from and\n    // an environment-captured channel called 'ch'.\n};\n// Likewise, the parent has both a 'po' and 'ch'\n```\n\nI think that's getting fairly concise.\n\nThe second thing is the unfortunate behavior in future_task: https://github.com/brson/rust/blob/b73864a4c439a50a28afcf422def5a884a96020b/src/libcore/task.rs#L302. In order to reuse a task_builder to build multiple tasks every stateful body generator needs to remember whether it has already been used or not and turn itself into a no-op if so. This creates some dumb performance behavior when reusing task_builder to get a lot of task futures (and eventually also other things like result futures).\n",

    "body": "I would be ok with setting a non-reusable flag on the builder.\n\nOne concern that I've found when converting the test suite to use this API is that we have a lot of tests using spawn_joinable (mostly I think because they are from an ancient era when task lifetimes had to be managed explicitly to avoid the runtime crashing). These all get more verbose with the new API. I'm not sure if this warrants keeping a spawn_joinable function - my suspicion is that these tests just represent very old code and not common use cases.\n",
