    "body": "It's best to run `make install` as non-root with DESTDIR and then install that globally - ideally with a package manager, but with `cp -a` if you must. This issue can be fixed, but the `Makefile` is a scary beast and this issue will keep coming back. I wouldn't trust it to be run as root, since one typo is enough to wipe the system out.\n\nhttps://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/commit/a047be85247755cdbe0acce6f1dafc8beb84f2ac\n",

I recommend compiling with `./configure --disable-rpath` if you want to install globally, as they're not required unless you're running out of the build directory. A `rustc` compiled with `--disable-rpath` will still use runpaths for the binaries it compiles, so it won't break anything.\n",
