    "body": "@thestinger \n\n> It does impact the design in that many APIs were designed around the libuv-based runtime.\n\nTo clarify:\n- The RFC is [explicitly motivated](https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/remove-runtime/active/0000-remove-runtime.md) by the desire to decouple `std::io` from the libuv runtime model.\n- However, the RFC itself (and therefore this issue) does not propose specific changes to the `std::io` API. It is about restructuring the implementation to enable such changes in the future.\n- I think we can and should consider specific changes to `std::io` as part of API stabilization (or via new RFCs, when the changes are substantial enough to warrant it.). But that effort is _not_ part of this issue or the RFC it's tracking.\n- We are not generally blocking the 1.0 milestone on API stabilization effort, and do not plan to make specific promises about which APIs will be stable by the 1.0 release.\n- All that said, as I proposed in my original comment, I think it probably makes sense to work on API revisions hand-in-hand with the work on this issue.\n",
