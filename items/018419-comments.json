    "body": "I don't personally think `rustdoc` should be compulsorily opinionated about this aspect of markdown. There's use-cases for manually writing some HTML to get the docs to render exactly how an author wants (and not just render: to be more accessible via better semantic markup), and if this stops a library's markdown docs being rendered to anything other than HTML it is the fault (and responsibility) of that library's author, not of our tooling (IMO, only way one might fault it would be that `rustdoc` only supports markdown input at the moment, but that's somewhat orthogonal).\n\nImprovements we could possibly make (off the top of my head) are:\n- implementing some warnings to try to catch cases of accidental/incorrect HTML (like the example in the original issue)\n- providing an option to make `rustdoc` disallow inline HTML all together \n- having a blacklist/whitelist HTML filtering stage for a user to chose to allow specific tags/functionality of HTML (opt-in; an extension to the previous one)\n\nI guess these may be quite hard (doing it properly would give `rustdoc` a dependency on e.g. html5ever), although from a glance the markdown library (hoedown) we use does support some options for controlling how HTML is handling, so at least having a way to error/disable inline HTML totally might not be so hard, although I haven't looked into in detail.\n\nI'm willing to be convinced that rustdoc should completely ignore this aspect of the commonmark spec, but, it would take some convincing (more than the objections to it mentioned so far :) )... at the very least, supporting no HTML ever does diverge from many of the most popular installations of markdown, e.g. [github](https://github.com/github/markup/tree/master#html-sanitization) and [stackexchange](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1777/what-html-tags-are-allowed-on-stack-exchange-sites) both <sub>support</sub> <ins>subsets</ins> of <kbd>inline</kbd> <sup>HTML</sup>.\n",
