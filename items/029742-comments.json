If it is an error\ninside a function signature, the problem may be with failing to adhere to the\nlifetime elision rules (see below).\n\nHere are some simple examples of where you'll run into this error:\n```\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo { x: &bool }        // error\nstruct Foo<'a> { x: &'a bool } // correct\n\nenum Bar { A(u8), B(&bool), }        // error\nenum Bar<'a> { A(u8), B(&'a bool), } // correct\n\ntype MyStr = &str;        // error\ntype MyStr<'a> = &'a str; // correct\n```\n\n```\nLifetime elision is a special, limited kind of inference for lifetimes in\nfunction signatures which allows you to leave out lifetimes in certain cases.\nFor more background on lifetime elision see [the book][book-le].\n\nThe lifetime elision rules require that any function signature with an elided\noutput lifetime must either have\n\n - exactly one input lifetime\n - or, multiple input lifetimes, but the function must also be a method with a\n   `&self` or `&mut self` receiver\n\nIn the first case, the output lifetime is inferred to be the same as the unique\ninput lifetime. In the second case, the lifetime is instead inferred to be the\nsame as the lifetime on `&self` or `&mut self`.\n\nHere are some examples of elision errors:\n\n```\n\n``` rust\n// error, no input lifetimes\nfn foo() -> &str { ... }\n\n// error, `x` and `y` have distinct lifetimes inferred\nfn bar(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str { ... }\n\n// error, `y`'s lifetime is inferred to be distinct from `x`'s\nfn baz<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &str) -> &str { ... }\n```\n\n```\n[book-le]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/lifetimes.html#lifetime-elision\n\n```\n",
