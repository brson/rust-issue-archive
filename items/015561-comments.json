    "body": "Actually, that suggests that perhaps type parameters should be inspected for `must_use` types. Right now an `Option<Result<T,U>>` does not get the `must_use` warning. If you inspected all type parameters, that would let you then just annotate `Map` (and perhaps the other adaptors that take closures) and it would work even when subsequently adapted by e.g. `.take(5)`.\n\nOf course, this too involves looking up attributes on more types, and I wonder how expensive this ends up being. Although it shouldn't be hard to create a cache so you don't have to look up a type twice if it does end up being significant.\n",
