    "body": "I don't think this is expected to work. The way method selection works, it needs to be able to narrow to at least a specific trait, without considering the types of the arguments. In the case of `FooChar` vs `FooInt`, we can't narrow to a specific trait _based solely on the receiver_. (In the case of `Bar`, we can -- the `Bar` trait).\n",
