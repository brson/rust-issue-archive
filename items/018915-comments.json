    "body": "This provides one piece of the puzzle but there are various ways this could be improved. It is _possible_ to replace the platform allocator on OS X / Windows but it's not as simple as overriding weak symbols. It could also use symbol aliases instead of wrappers in the case where liballoc is being statically linked.\n\n## Future improvements\n\nIt would be nice if an alternate global allocator could be dropped in at runtime (dropping in an asserts build of jemalloc or another allocator), but it's not yet clear if there's a good way to do it beyond 2 layers of indirection (wrapper functions marked as weak). On some platforms like Windows, mixed allocator usage is outweighed by the gains of using a better allocator in Rust code. However, it's a performance / memory usage loss relative to using a single great allocator in both Rust and C due to various forms of fragmentation. On FreeBSD, the system allocator **is** jemalloc so Rust should avoid bundling it there in the future.\n",
