    "body": "@aturon That sounds great. I figured that TypeId would remain experimental just because it seems like such a raw tool that it wouldn't be finished yet, but certain parts of it could easily be marked stable. For instance, it would be easy to maintain backwards compatibility of `TypeId::of` if we also didn't stabilize `TypeId::hash`, since it would be impossible to inspect the result except by comparison to other `TypeId`s. \n",
