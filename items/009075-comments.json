    "body": "Ah, the comment above the `Hash` trait actually says: \"Note that this trait is likely to change somewhat as it is closely related to `to_bytes::IterBytes` and in almost all cases presently the two are ( _and must be_ ) used together.\" (emphasis added).\n\nStill, this limitation in how one implements `Hash` seems strange to me.  (Even though I agree that it is usually better to just delegate the definition of hash to `IterBytes`, the developer should be free to implement `Hash` their own way if they want.)\n",

    "body": "The reason for this limitation is apparent in the implementation, as pointed out to me on IRC:\n\n(from hash.rs):\n\n```\nimpl<A:IterBytes> Hash for A {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nI remain curious as to whether we intend to uphold this limitation permanently, or figure out another approach for resolving this.  (But just so I am entirely upfront: I have no objections if we resolve this by saying: \"If you want to implement your own hash function, then you have to also implement your own hash table with which to couple it\", which is a work-around one can use today if one so desires.)\n",
