    "body": "The `recursion_limit` is there to prevent us from looping infinitely (or overflowing the stack) in various cases that can grow without bound. Examples are trait resolution and monomorphization. Right now we have a single limit that you can raise for all things. It's conceivable we might want to change the design -- for example, a scale factor might be better than an absolute value. Still, I'd prefer to have something finalized and in place for 1.0, because some programs will need this tuning knob (servo has used it, for example). @brson's concern was that the correct value for this knob is implementation dependent: this is somewhat true. The algorithms are inherently unbounded, but the depth required can be affected by various impl details such as the choice of iteration order or the use of caching.\n",
