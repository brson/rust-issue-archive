    "body": "So as pointed out by folks on IRC, the 3rd attempt is indeed workable and I am an idiot, this makes it run fine:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::rand::{IsaacRng, XorShiftRng, RngUtil, Rng};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut rng = rng();\n    printfln!(rng.gen_bytes(10));\n}\n\nstruct StrongRng(IsaacRng);\nimpl Rng for StrongRng {\n    pub fn next(&mut self) -> u32 {\n        return (**self).next();\n    }\n}\n\npub fn rng() -> StrongRng {\n    StrongRng(IsaacRng::new())\n}\n\nstruct WeakRng(XorShiftRng);\nimpl Rng for WeakRng {\n    pub fn next(&mut self) -> u32 {\n        return (**self).next();\n    }\n}\n\npub fn weak_rng() -> WeakRng {\n    WeakRng(XorShiftRng::new())\n}\n```\n\nStill the proposed solution is shorter and nicer with less boilerplate.\n",

The same idea has popped up in other places like #7773 and the [Overloadable deference operator](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-July/005039.html) discussion on the ML.\n\nThe idea in the OP is GHC's [GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/deriving.html#newtype-deriving) (bunch of detail there, might be worth reading), which I support. One notable property of it is that it re-uses the _same_ `impl` for the newtype as for the base (appropriately transmuted), instead of generating a new one, which isn't necessarily true of the more general `Proxy` idea.\n",

    "body": "Here's [the paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.178.4819) discussing the problem and GHC's solution to it, if anyone's interested.\n\nThe basic shape of it is that GNTD acts as if, for the purposes of deriving those traits, the newtype and its base were the same type. And, representationally, they are. But otherwise they aren't, and if you have ways to distinguish them and \"branch\" on the difference at the type level - GADTs, type-level functions (~associated types), what have you - you can derive a contradiction. I don't know if Rust has any way to do that right now (those examples are things it doesn't have), but it's something to keep in mind. If GNTD were restricted to only deriving impls you could also write by hand, that would remove the potential for conflict, so if we don't want to add a similar distinction to the type system between equality of types and equality of representations as GHC will soon have, that might be the way to go.\n\nThe broader issue the paper discusses is that while you can cast between a newtype and its base at no cost, that's no longer true if they're embedded in another type. E.g. if you have `struct Age(int)`, the only way to go between `~[Age]` and `~[int]` in safe code is to map the newtype cast (a no-op) over the elements and create a new array, while (if the newtype is not opaque to you) it _should_ be safe to cast directly. I don't know whether Rust has bumped into this problem yet.\n",

It might work if we extend it to something like:\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(Rng(method=\"fn next(&mut self) -> u32\"))]\n...\n```\n\nso the syntax extension had access to the signatures.\n\nIn any case, one doesn't need to implement `RngUtil` by hand (or any `...Util` trait, by convention), it has an impl of the form `impl<R: Rng> RngUtil for R`, i.e. every `Rng` has all those methods automatically.\n\nAlso, I proposed something very similar to this in https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/7773.
