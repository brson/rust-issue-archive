  "body": "This is the bare minimum to stop using split stacks on Windows, fixing https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/13259 and #14742, by turning on stack probes for all functions and disabling compiler and runtime support for split stacks on Windows.\n\nIt does not restore the out-of-stack error message, which requires more runtime work.\n\nThis includes a test that the Windows TCB is no longer being clobbered, but the out-of-stack test itself is pretty weak, only testing that the program exits abnormally, not that it isn't writing to bogus memory, so I haven't truly verified that this is providing the safety we claim.\n\nA more complete solution is in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/16388, which has some unresolved issues yet.\n\ncc @Zoxc @klutzy @vadimcn\n",
