    "body": "Funny thing: while you're absolutely right that the document is inconsistent (and rustboot errs on the side of not allowing aliases), I have a hunch that they _can_ be supported in those contexts, due to the way they're implemented. The edits you're making here are essentially covering over the tracks of some wishful thinking I've not yet managed to work out rules to handle.\n\nI suppose for the sake of clarity I'll fold them in, and file a bug suggesting we figure out how to support aliases \"someday\".\n",
