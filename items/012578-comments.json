    "body": "While being skeptical of the possibility of such compiler magic at first, I've come to consider it doable.\nIt comes at a cost, because it does involve duplicating all the types that reach the type to replace, and also all the AST structures that reach that type.\nThere's also non-trivial substitutions, like vtables (which would probably have to be recomputed anyways).\nThis might be easier to implement if we change typeck to transform the AST into a typed CFG, as per @nikomatsakis' plans/ideas.\n",
