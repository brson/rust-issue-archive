  "body": "The old method of building up a list of items and threading it through\nall of the decorators was unwieldy and not really scalable as\nnon-deriving ItemDecorators become possible. The API is now that the\ndecorator gets an immutable reference to the item it's attached to, and\na callback that it can pass new items to. If we want to add syntax\nextensions that can modify the item they're attached to, we can add that\nlater, but I think it'll have to be separate from ItemDecorator to avoid\nstrange ordering issues.\n\n@huonw\n",
