Moreover, outside of LLVM the knowledge about how much stack is used is not complete (how many registers are going to be spilled? are `alloca`s optimised away?).

    "body": "@ranma42 No, I am proposing exactly per-thread checks. It's just that LLVM's lowering of thread-locals is not useful for non-hosted targets, and anyway, nearly always the only reasonable way to implement those is using a regular global variable. In case your LLVM's lowering for your target does support useful thread-locals, you can simply supply one.\n\nYes. This feature can only be implemented as an LLVM pass; probably no changes to rustc itself are wanted or necessary. However, LLVM is an implementation detail. Rust claims to provide memory safety; it is the duty of its compilers to ensure that memory safety can in fact be provided on all platforms. I think that rustc should include such a pass in its fork of LLVM, since it is going to use its own fork for foreseeable future anyway, specifically due to Rust-specific passes.\n",

(I used `movw`/`movt` to avoid wait states for the case where flash runs at a lower frequency than the core, but if a load from a constant island would be used, the size penalty is 14 bytes plus four bytes per 4k of code). There are no caches, so the delay inflicted by memory access is isolated and predictable.\n\nSince red zone is used, leaf functions with small stack frames do not have to pay at all.\n",

When initiated, a stack probe reaches benignly into memory by the amount of space that is required to store the function's local variables.\n> \n> If a function requires more than size bytes of stack space for local variables, its stack probe is initiated.

For one, this makes it significantly harder to maintain rustc support for out-of-tree LLVM backends. Another reason is that this is something that really ought to benefit the entire LLVM community, not just rustc but at least also clang (`-fstack-check` currently does nothing).\r\n\r\nFWIW I am watching the progress of those two patches closely.
