Some points of note are:\n- This provides a nice boundary for methods on Path that do I/O and not.\n- This makes it a little easier to migrate Path to libcore and PathBuf to libcollections, but it's unclear what that use case is.\n- This design pattern exists nowhere else in the standard library (e.g. an extension trait available everywhere, just requires importing the trait).\n",
