    "body": "Hi @artagnon, thanks for the docs! However, they should probably use the new method of iteration via external iterators (defined in `std::iterator`), since `vec::each` will be removed soon(-ish). That, is:\n\n```\nlet v = [1,2,3,4,5];\nv.iter().advance(|&i| { println(i.to_str()); true })\n\n// ...\n\nlet v = [1,2,3];\nfor v.iter().advance |&i| {\n    println(i.to_str());\n}\n```\n\n(Note that the temporary `v` is required because of #3511.)\n",

Anyhow, I pushed out a new version: merge if you're happy with this.\n\nI suspected as much about `vec::each()`.  Are you planning to introduce a trait to get [1,2,3].each to work in the future though?  It works with hashmaps (because of the Map trait), and the asymmetry is very displeasing.\n",

    "body": "Well, the `each` method on the `Map` trait is likely to be removed.\n\nThere are plans for making `for` use these iterators (that is the `for` construction checks for the `Iterator` trait, and/or a yet-to-be-implemented `Iterable` trait), so one can write `for v.iter() |i| { ... }` or even `for v |i| { ... }` (the exact syntax may change), and even `for map.iter() |(key, value)| { ... }` (again, possibly without the `.iter()`).\n\n---\n\nIn any case, I made a mistake, you are correct that this PR should use `each` rather than the new technique; however, it may not be merged, since bors testing time is at a premium at the moment and this function is slated for removal. (If `each` is looking like it will still exist for 0.7, then this should be merged.)\n",
