  "body": "Edit: whoops, didn't mean to hit post.\n\nAnyway, this is something I tried to do when I first implemented cloned, but couldn't figure out. Somewhere between then and the PR actually landing, we got Deref of references, so now this works! :tada: \n\nAlso turns out the test for the functionality was never marked as a #[test]. Oops!\n\nAlso added a Cloned iterator adaptor. If this isn't desirable, it can be taken out of the PR (seperate commits).\n",
