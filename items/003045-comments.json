    "body": "All of our examples in the tutorial automatically compile whenever we do a build (several times a day), so you can be confident that if you see a code example in the tutorial, it will compile with Rust as built from git HEAD. Examples aren't guaranteed to compile with older versions of Rust, so if you're running an older version of rustc, that's why.\n\nIn the (hopefully near) future we will be versioning the documentation.\n",
