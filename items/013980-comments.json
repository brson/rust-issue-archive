    "body": "It is actually reading uninitialised data, but this is deliberate and not a logic error. See the [cited source](http://research.swtch.com/sparse) for more details.\n\nInterestingly, RE2, which uses the same trick, has the following code:\n\n```\n// Don't need to zero the memory, but do so anyway\n// to appease Valgrind.\nif (valgrind_) {\n  for (int i = 0; i < max_size; i++) {\n    dense_[i] = 0xababababU;\n    sparse_to_dense_[i] = 0xababababU;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, it should be more efficient if you initialize `sparse` to `!0` instead of `0`, as this will make the membership test fail on the first condition instead of the second.\n",
