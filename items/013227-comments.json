    "body": "Thank you for this work, I think it's great that there's effort behind adding a work queue!\n\nI agree with @brson though, that this is a broad enough topic that it warrants an RFC. Work queues have many flavors to them, and I think that an RFC is necessary to discuss the tradeoffs and discuss design for the one inside of `libsync`. I would recommend starting by gathering more knowledge about existing work queues in Rust and see how they play into this design. I would be more than willing to talk about the \"work queue\" in libgreen, and I'm sure @pcwalton would love to talk about the work queue work that he's done in Servo.\n\nOur RFC process is documented at the [rfcs repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).\n",
