    "body": "Here is a rough plan I worked out:\n\n### First snapshot will contain:\n- Implement the `Sized` bound and require its use:\n  - initially all types will be considered `Sized` except for type parameters w/o a `Sized` bound\n  - type of all local variables must be sized\n  - whenever you index into a vector, type of elements must be sized\n  - whenever you dereference a pointer in a non-lvalue context, type of the pointee must be sized\n    - moves is already computing a lot of this information, if we generalize it a bit it can tell us whether a given context is lvalue vs rvalue, which would be useful for other things as well\n- Add `proc` type, `proc` literals\n- Enforce `fn:K` bounds on the upvars\n  - check that upvars have the proper bounds\n  - consider bounds when computing `TypeContents` of a closure type\n- Add `Trait:K` bounds on object types (I think they are not parsed today)\n\n### Second snapshot will contain\n- Port uses of `@fn` and `~fn` to use `proc`\n- Remove `@fn`, `~fn`\n- Add new `fn` type (just closures) and interpret `&fn` as `fn`\n- Enforce `Trait:K` bounds on trait types\n  - as with the \"closure\" case above\n\n### Third sdnapshot\n- Remove `&fn` as a special case\n- Modify `ty.rs` to remove `evec`, `estr`, sigils from objects. Deal with fallout.\n\nObviously the last step is a little vague.\n",

Exciting!\n\nThere was some talk at the end of last discussion on this about alternatives to adding a full `proc` type-family, either forcing use of traits for the use cases, or moving it into another possibly disjoint `fn`-qualifier-name (like `extern`, `unsafe` and `once`), just to avoid the superficial charge of \"having multiple types of function\". Did you have feelings about that?\n",

    "body": "@graydon it seems I never responded to you. I had a long response prepared but I guess I closed (or lost?) the tab. Short version: I am open to discussion, but I think that as far as my personal preference goes, I'd prefer to change `extern fn` to a different noun rather than an `adjective+noun`. Even I find the current fn types kind of confusing, and I think they will only be more confusing if we add in `env fn` or something like that. I would sort of prefer that you select the noun based on the memory ownership rules then you can use the \"adjectives\" to designate restrictions that the caller must observe (caller must be unsafe, caller can only call once) and the bounds (fn:K, proc:K) to restrict the values that can be closed over. At least that was the logic. But my main goal is to make the types comprehensible, so if others feel that it's more comprehensible and/or feels less complicated to always include `fn`, I'm persuadable.\n",

    "body": "We probably don't want to allow unsizedness ever to \"infect\" containing types the same way the rest of the builtin bounds can, do we? The hardest case is with type parameters. For example:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<T> {\n    data: T,\n}\nstruct Bar<T> {\n    data: ~T,\n}\n```\n\nand in another file:\n\n```\nx: Foo<[int]>, // must be either illegal or dynamically-sized\ny: Bar<[int]>, // ok, but should we support it?\n```\n\nedit: In fact, the first case should almost certainly be illegal, due to `struct Baz { x: Foo<[Int]>, y: Bar<[Int]>, }` -- if allowed, the offset of y would have to be computed at runtime.\n\nedit 2: This hints at other places where you'd need to use the `Sized` bound even when `Copy` is not in play -- container data structures. Examples: moving something into an ARC, mapping an option<T> to an option<U>, inserting into a hashtable.\n",

    "body": "OK, I have implemented a basic check for this, and added enough `Sized` bounds in libstd to make it compile with the new check, and have some stats to give a feeling for how often `Sized` will be needed.\n\nKeep in mind, the check is less strict than it will eventually need to be. It currently prohibits unsized types in function return types, bound locals (including arguments, patterns, and static globals), struct/vector/enum/tuple constructors, and by-value self. It does not yet prohibit referring to impossible types such as `~[T]` (with unsized `T`), and it doesn't check function signatures inside traits.\n\nStats:\n- 50 files need Sized bounds at all; 84 do not. Among the 50 that do, on average 12.7 Sizeds per file.\n- Among the 572 `fn`/`impl` declarations that need `Sized`, 475 (83%) of them _don't_ also have `Copy`. 283 (49%) of them don't have any other trait bounds at all.\n- The most popular reason for needing `Sized` are as follows, according to build errors before adding `Sized`:\n\n33.4%   function return type\n20.1%   local variable bound in pattern\n19.3%   function argument\n12.6%   tuple element\n7.5%    statically-allocated variable\n3.2%    struct field\n2.5%    by-value self type\n1.4%    vector element\n- (edit to add) There are 322 remaining polymorphic functions/impls that don't have to use `Sized` (36% of total). (I obtained this with the command `grep -R '\\(fn\\|impl\\)[^<(]*<.*>' . | grep -v Sized | grep -v \"<'\\(self\\|r\\|a\\|a,'b\\)>\" | wc -l`.)\n",

While not strictly _required_, it feels like we're working awfully hard to avoid them, and for no particular reason. It's easy enough to enforce the bounds at the creation site. It would also help to address an issue with Drop, because right now it makes no sense to have any bounds at all on the type parameters for a drop impl --- otherwise, what, you only run the dtor if the type parameter is owned?\n\nRegarding the statistics, that's great information to have.\n",
