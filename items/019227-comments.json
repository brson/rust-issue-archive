Security experts would say `mktemp(1)` is essential for avoiding the symlink attack, but... should all of us be that cautious?  Using different working directories every time isn't desirable for, eg. supporting HTTP GET resume.\n\nApart from that, you really need to check if `TMP_DIR` was successfully set or not.   One of the idioms for check is:\n\n``` sh\nTMP_DIR=`mktemp -d` || exit 1\n```\n\nThere are several invocation of `rm -Rf \"${TMP_DIR}\"` later in the script.  They scare me a lot...\n",

    "body": "@nodakai Thanks for taking a look! Good point about exiting if it fails.\n\nI made a fallback to the current bahavior if `mktemp` fails. That should take care of those problems. \n\nI didn't think about the HTTP resume scenario, but it doesn't seem like rustup is trying to do that\u2014it deletes the folder up front.\n\n> Does it not suffice to simply cd to the $TMPDIR environment variable (or alike) when creating the working directory?\n\nYes, I could definitely just do that. It just didn't seem right to me to pollute the current directory (whatever that might be) with a `rustup-tmp-install` directory. Especially when if the user, like me, triggers automatic backup routines in said folder.\n\nTo be honest, this isn't a big deal to me; I can always work around it. I just assume that someone else will have simlar issues.\n",
