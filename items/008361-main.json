  "body": "When running rusti 32-bit tests from a 64-bit host, these errors came up frequently. My best idea as to what was happening is:\n1. First, if you hash the same `int` value on 32-bit and 64-bit, you will get two different hashes.\n2. In a cross-compile situation, let's say x86_64 is building an i686 library, all of the hashes will be 64-bit hashes.\n3. Then let's say you use the i686 libraries and then attempt to link against the same i686 libraries, because you're calculating hashes with a 32-bit int instead of a 64-bit one, you'll have different hashes and you won't be able to find items in the metadata (the items were generated with a 64-bit int).\n\nThis patch changes the items to always be hashed as an `i64` to preserve the hash value across architectures. Here's a nice before/after for this patch of the state of rusti tests\n\n```\nhost   target  before  after\n64     64      yes     yes\n64     32      no      no (llvm assertion)\n32     64      no      yes\n32     32      no      no (llvm assertion)\n```\n\nBasically one case started working, but currently when the target is 32-bit LLVM is having a lot of problems generating code. That's another separate issue though.\n",
