  "body": "There are a number of problems with MSVC landing pads today:\n- They only work about 80% of the time with optimizations enabled. For example when running the run-pass test suite a failing test will cause `compiletest` to segfault (b/c of a thread panic). There are also a large number of run-fail tests which will simply crash.\n- Enabling landing pads caused the regression seen in #26915.\n\nOverall it looks like LLVM's support for MSVC landing pads isn't as robust as we'd like for now, so let's take a little more time before we turn them on by default.\n\nCloses #26915\n",
