    "body": "IMO this is a pretty big gotcha when refactoring a C-like enum to be non-C-like. At least, it got me; see #18154.  It's especially confusing because casting the nullary variants of the enum is already forbidden, which leads one to believe that \"fix stuff until it compiles\" is a valid strategy.  And the result is weird crashes or worse.  So I don't think it can be a loadable lint, because you won't think to load it until after you've been bit by this.  I kind of want it to be part of typeck for consistency, but the rule implemented here is a bit too heuristic.\n\n> if you ever intend to do the actual operation that the lint fires 100% of the time in a false-positive fashion\n\nI don't think that's really the case here.  Note that this only applies to `ExprCast`; something like\n\n``` rust\nfn set_callback(f: fn(u8) -> Tag);\n\nset_callback(Tag::Inline);\n```\n\nwon't warn.  Maybe we should allow `Tag::Inline as fn(u8) -> Tag` and only forbid `Tag::Inline as uint`, but the former didn't even compile when I tried it.\n",
