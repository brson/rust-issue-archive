    "body": "This looks good to me. I guess I shouldn't have r+ed yet because I would like you to modify the formatting of the types. Maybe you can do a follow up.\n\nI'm not sure about the AtomicPtr type. As written it is wildly unsafe because if you call `take` then the value is destroyed it will (in theory) try to destroy a null pointer. In the current implementation this _may_ work because the drop glue checks for null, but this isn't guaranteed by Rust semantics.\n\nAn AtomicOption<T> may be more appropriate for that purpose.\n",

    "body": "Yeah, I was really unsure about the AtomicPtr, since it seemed to be turning into some kind of half baked Cell implementation. \n\nI may change it to be explicitly unsafe and use *mut pointers instead of ~-pointers which also avoids the issue of destructors at the expense of aliasing. On the flip side, it does make a compare-and-swap operation make more sense, semantically. Atomic operations like this are pretty low level anyway, so I'm comfortable with that tradeoff. \n",
