    "body": "Thanks for your follow-up questions.\n\nThis issue https://github.com/JeffMurray/must/issues/1 has a link to a bug I tracked down.  It was difficult to find because the runtime reports \"rust: task failed at 'connection closed', /home/jeff/rust-0.7/src/libstd/option.rs:307\", rather than the line of call that issued recv() on the closed connection.\n\nAnother example, although more complicated, is current issue I am facing.\n\nhttps://github.com/JeffMurray/must/blob/cbb0c9d7e0cb6e46a35772ac567b4b680ba3f5ef/src/must_bank.rs#L331\n\nIt is \"fixed\" (usually) by placing a bunch of yields() before my tear-down call.\n\nI think I have a handle on the problem with my code, but fixing these things are hit and miss because the line containing the recv() that causes it is not reported?\n",
