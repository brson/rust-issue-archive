    "body": "I recently asked about exactly this [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55521669/compiler-forces-me-to-implement-trait-method-but-the-self-trait-bound-on-metho) where I was referred to this issue. This issue is very relevant for the design of a library I'm developing right now, so I'm very interested in resolving this. \r\n\r\nHere is a short real life example:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nI'm working on a polygon mesh processing library that abstracts over meshes. The important part for this example is that there are some mesh data structures that are restricted to triangular faces while some other data structures support all kinds of faces (in particular, mixed faces in one instance).\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Dummy\r\nstruct Vertex;\r\n\r\n\r\n// Mesh kind marker types. Can be replaced with enum once const generic \r\n// lands. This trait is \"sealed\", i.e. it is only implemented by these two\r\n// types.\r\ntrait FaceKind {}\r\nenum TriFace {}\r\nenum PolyFace {}\r\nimpl FaceKind for TriFace {}\r\nimpl FaceKind for PolyFace {}\r\n\r\n\r\ntrait Mesh {\r\n    type FaceKind: FaceKind;\r\n    \r\n    // All meshes can add triangles, but only some meshes can add \r\n    // arbitrary faces.\r\n    fn add_triangle(&mut self, vertices: &[Vertex; 3]);\r\n    fn add_face(&mut self, vertices: &[Vertex])\r\n    where\r\n        Self: Mesh<FaceKind = PolyFace>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nstruct MyTriMesh {}\r\nimpl Mesh for MyTriMesh {\r\n    type FaceKind = TriFace;\r\n    \r\n    fn add_triangle(&mut self, vertices: &[Vertex; 3]) {\r\n        // stuff\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    fn add_face(&mut self, vertices: &[Vertex]) {\r\n        unreachable!() // <-- this is annoying and not robust\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is only a small part of my API: there are many other places where this is relevant.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThis thread has been rather quiet and it doesn't seem like a lot has happened in this regards in the last 5 years. So: **what would be next steps to resolve this issue?**\r\n\r\nProbably writing a new RFC, right? Or is there some other work on the way that will have significant impact on this issue (e.g. the chalkification) and thus writing an RFC now doesn't make sense? If not and someone would be willing to start writing an RFC, what are important topics to discuss in the RFC? @nikomatsakis already [mentioned something about negative reasoning and coherence](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20021#issuecomment-242547315).

    "body": "(Copying what I said in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48214#issuecomment-1258611721)\r\n\r\nI would actually argue *against* this feature, for the following reason: I believe that `Self` bounds (or bounds on type parameters of the trait) on individual trait methods with no default implementation are an anti-pattern. Such bounds should be discouraged, in favor of separate traits. This code is questionable because it means that if type A starts implementing trait `T`, that can suddenly invalidate its implementation of trait `U` because `U` had a `where Self: T` trait method with no default impl. [It's also a problem for traits wanting to take advantage of expansions to object safety in future versions of the language](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/removing-self-sized-and-backward-compatibility/17456). I don't think complicated negative-reasoning rules are worth it just to accommodate this questionable pattern.\r\n\r\nBut maybe there is a use-case I am missing, where separate traits are not adequate?",
