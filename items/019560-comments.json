    "body": "Interesting! This was somewhat surprising to me as I thought this would be a custom message to print out on test failure rather than \"this test failed\" with no output from the test. The semantic meaning implemented here, however, I think makes more sense to me.\n\nThis is one of the major reasons I avoid `should_fail` tests as much as possible because I'm not actually sure that the part I wanted to fail actually failed, so this seems like a great thing to have. @sfackler do you think that my initial interpretation is a possible to make, or am I off my rocker? Perhaps we could get \"expected\" somewhere in the name?\n",
