    "body": "Now I see that this is actually described in the documentation chapter [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/documentation.html#documentation-as-tests). However, I was looking at the testing chapter [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/testing.html#documentation-tests). So the bug report should now be changed to \"cross-referece the doctest part of the documentation chapter from the doctest part of the testing chapter\" since I completely missed the relevant section despite looking for it rather extensively.\n",
