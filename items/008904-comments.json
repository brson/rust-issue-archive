(Its closed, but I'm not quite clear on whether it was closed because the bots had their file limits increased, _or_ if the increase in the limits is masking the fact that this bug persists.)_\n",

It appears that the `libstd` tests automatically increase the file descriptor limit, but this is just affecting `compiletest` now because it's got so many children.\n\nI think the fix here is to call `raise_fd_limit` in `compiletest` on osx.
