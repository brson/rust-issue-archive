  "body": "Changes int/uint range_rev to iterate over range `(hi,lo]` instead of `[hi,lo)`.\n\nFix #5270.\n\nAlso:\n- Adds unit tests for int/uint range functions\n- Updates the uses of `range_rev` to account for the new semantics.  (Note that pretty much all of the updates there were strict improvements to the code in question; yay!)\n- Exposes new function, `range_step_inclusive`, which does the range `[hi,lo]`, (at least when `hi-lo` is a multiple of the `step` parameter).\n- Special-cases when `|step| == 1` removing unnecessary bounds-check.  (I did not check whether LLVM was already performing this optimization; I figure it would be a net win to not leave that analysis to the compiler.  If reviewer objects, I can easily remove that from the refactored code.)\n\n(This pull request is a rebased version of PR #7524, which went stale due to recent unrelated changes to num libraries.)\n",
