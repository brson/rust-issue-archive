I'm not sure if we're officially supporting XP or not, but sadly our `cfg` syntax isn't smart enough to deal with ranges of versions (compile this only for windows vista, everything greater than vista, etc). I think for now we'll want to stick with this for now because I don't want to have to deal with porting all the static initialization of pthreads mutexes/condition variables for now.\n\nIf this does end up getting landed though, I'll definitely open an issue with that link because it would be pretty awesome to not leak allocations or have to worry about them at all.\n",
