    "body": "cc @brson, @rillian \n\nThis is primarily motivated by Gecko which requires 10.6 compatibility but is currently having to compile their own OSX toolchain (with `--disable-elf-tls`). The primary benefit for this to them is if we ourselves start compiling our nightlies to run on 10.6, which means the standard library won't use ELF TLS. External consumers of the standard library, however, will continue to use ELF TLS by default. This seems like an ok balance between compatibility and speed to me, but I'm curious what others think!\n",

For gecko we actually build on 10.7, so the compiler itself can use ELF TLS, we just need it to be able to produce binaries which work on 10.6 (and so libstd must not use ELF TLS) when MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is < 10.7.\n\nIf I understand the patch properly, that case is still covered by building nightlies with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6, but I wanted to be sure the requirement is clear.\n",
