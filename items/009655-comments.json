    "body": "I can't leave inline comment on diff :( here are rough questions on just skimming `path/windows.rs`:\n- On Win32 it currently assumes any ~[u8] inputs are utf-8 rather than arbitrary bytes, right? I'm totally ok with it, but I just want to be sure that there is more stuff to do for edge cases. :)\n- Seems that `is_sep` and `is_sep2` have different use cases. Is it right that its main concern is \"some/relative/path\" is ok but \"//?/prefixed/absolute/path\" is not?\n- Similarly, `fn prefix_allows_slash` seems to indicate whether we should use `is_sep` or `is_sep2`, but `prefix_is_verbatim` also does same role at `push_str_unchecked { fn push_str_unchecked }`. Is it intended?\n- On \"though does Windows use UTF-16 or UCS-2?\" comment: I thought windows uses utf16 (or ucs2 if < xp) if it is without \"\\?\\\" but it just uses raw ~[u16] if it is with \"\\?\\\" since it [bypasses some string parsing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) and sends it directly to fs driver\n",

I replied to your comments, and I'm fixing all of the ones that have a clear resolution (i.e. I'm not trying to fix verbatim paths in glob because there's no obvious solution besides ignoring them).\n\n@alexcrichton: Will do\n\n@klutzy: \n- Yes, `~[u8]` inputs must be utf-8. It raises `str::not_utf8` if they're not (as it passes them through `str::from_utf8` and friends).\n- Yes, `is_sep` tests specifically for `\\`, and `is_sep2` allows for both `\\` and `/`. The former is used for verbatim paths (`\\\\?\\foo\\bar`) and the latter for mostly everything else.\n- No, that's a good point. `prefix_allows_slash` is equivalent to `!prefix_is_verbatim`. I'll fix that.\n- `\\\\?\\` bypasses string parsing, yes, but the windows APIs are still going to be taking WCHARs, which are 16-bit values, so they still can't take arbitrary byte sequences.\n",

This is a massive amount of code to maintain for maybe not necessarily it's same weight in functionality. I'm not sure if this is indicative of rust being naturally more verbose, this having lots of documentation, this being far more robust, or perhaps this just does so much more.\n\nI'll continue looking at this tomorrow (hopefully I'll finish PosixPath and maybe WindowsPath as well)\n",

    "body": "@brson and I were talking about this earlier today, and here were some conclusions that we came to:\n- This is a lot of code, but the path api needs to accommodate these use cases.\n- There should be no difference in the API between windows/posix, code compiling for one platform should seamlessly compile for the other (unless you start reaching into windows/posix modules)\n- We want to try to reduce the API entry points into a Path. This is for simplification, code reduction, and removal of possibly extraneous features. The best way which we came up with to do this was to remove all methods taking `&mut`, essentially making a `Path` an immutable structure. This would greatly reduce portions as some of these are easily implementable in terms of others (if you're willing to make the allocation). We're not worried about this being the absolute most performant code, because path manipulation is probably not high up in the profiles of anyone's functions.\n\nI was curious as to your thoughts on that as well. I think that I'll postpone re-reviewing until we decide on how to progress forward.\n",

    "body": "I discussed this briefly with @brson in IRC. I'm open to more discussion, but for the moment, my feeling is that the mutation methods are too useful to remove. Furthermore, because the non-mutation methods are expressed in terms of the mutation ones, removing them wouldn't actually reduce code size (as the best way to do that would be to just mark them `priv`).\n\nI agree that windows/posix should share an API. I believe that, as it stands now, every public method on `posix::Path` and `windows::Path` are compatible. Almost all are defined on `GenericPath`, and the ones that aren't have the same behavior and method signature, modulo the concrete type backing the component iterators. As discussed with @alexcrichton before, the Windows-specific methods have been turned into toplevel functions in the `windows` namespace already. AFAIK, without reaching into `posix` or `windows`, you cannot write code with the module right now that compiles for one platform but not the other[1].\n\nIn exchange, I'm proposing to remove the following methods:\n- `set_dirname()`\n- `with_dirname()`\n- `set_filestem()`\n- `with_filestem()`\n- `add_extension()`\n- `file_path()`\n\n[1] This isn't strictly true. You could do something like define a function that takes a `path::PosixPath`, and then pass it a `path::Path`, and that will fail to compile under Windows. But I'm not sure how to fix that. You could do something similar with `path::ComponentIter`.\n",

    "body": "Oh sorry I forgot to mention, but when I say that I worry about code side, I don't really care about compiled code size more than lines of code size (as in `priv` wouldn't change anything). In terms of mutable methods though, I may have to look again, but a large contributor to code size that I saw were all of the mutator functions. The implementations were quite long and handled many many corner cases, which if I recall correctly the few I looked at could be expressed very simply with non-mutation apis. I'd have to go back and read for sure, but that was the general idea that I got.\n\nOtherwise I think that removing those methods is certainly a great starting point at least. I'd also recommend taking a look at other path management libraries to see what sort of functionality they expose as well. I don't think we want to be the greatest common factor among them, but we also don't want to be the lowest common denominator.\n",

    "body": "Yeah I figured you meant code size, which is why I said that removing the mutable methods wouldn't change anything as they'd just be marked `priv`. Yes, a large portion of the code base is the mutator methods, but the non-mutator methods that return a mutated value (e.g. `with_filename()`) all work by cloning the receiver and then calling the mutator method. So you wouldn't be saving anything there. I don't think they can be expressed any simpler using non-mutation APIs than they're already expressed as mutation APIs.\n",
