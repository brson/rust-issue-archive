How important is it to fix?\n\nOne can see similar paren-wrapping work-arounds elsewhere in such cases where disambiguation is necessary (e.g. to distinguish a method call `a.foo()` from a field-deref+function invocation `(a.foo)()`).\n\nSo, would it possibly suffice in this case to improve the parser's error message?\n",

    "body": "As far as I can tell, there is no \u2018nice\u2019 way of fully resolving this, as an expression/statements like `foo!() -1` is/are valid _semantically_ under either interpretation. \u2018Fixing\u2019 this bug would almost certainly create another one about how `make_an_int!() - 1` isn\u2019t valid, although that is probably a less intrusive issue than this one. Removing statement macros altogether would work, but I don\u2019t think we should: they\u2019re actually quite useful for macros that expand to items, which is actually a relatively common use case for macros and shouldn\u2019t require a semicolon. However, the obvious alternative is to parse things like `foo!() -1` as `(foo!() - 1)`, which is confusing when `foo!()` _is_ a statement/item macro. So I see these options (mostly ignoring implementation details):\n1. Special-case the ambiguity resolution only for binary operators that can\u2019t also start an expression. Things like `foo!() -1` and `foo!() ()` would be parsed as they are today, while things like `foo!() + 1` and `foo!().bar` would be accepted as equivalent to `(foo!() + 1)` and `(foo!()).bar`, whereas they are invalid today. This is the only backwards-compatible option, and covers most realistic cases, but is quite inconsistent (e.g., it handles `+` and `-` differently). This could also be cut down to handle fewer cases, denying `foo!() + 1` for consistency with `foo!() - 1` etc.\n2. Always resolve an operator after a macro invocation as a binary operator. This would break current code like `foo!() -1` and `foo!() ()`, but in practice such cases are quite rare. This has the advantage of making code using macros in places like `foo!().bar()` and `generate_int!() - 1` behave as one would expect, but would break existing code like `generate_structs! { /* ... lots of code ... */ } -1` in a rather confusing manner.\n3. Do some kind of hack that generates two _possible_ parsing options for code like `foo!() - 1`, and then resolves which one to do once the macro is expanded. So if `foo!()` expands to `struct Foo;`, then treat it as a statement macro; if `foo!()` expands to `1i`, treat it as an expression macro. I have no idea if this would even be possible, but it would probably be the ideal option, although it is backwards-incompatible.\n4. Assume that macros with `()` and `[]` are expressions and that macros with `{}` are statements. This is an attractive option as it follows the requirements for `struct`: tuple structs (which use `()`) require a semicolon following the declaration, while normal structs (which use `{}`) don\u2019t.\n",
