    "body": "I feel like a big goal of this work was the ability for other people to make use of the logging system for something more than debug printfs. At first I was writing a comment saying how we hadn't even started on this design work as far as I could tell, but thinking more about it I decided that since designing a \"one size fits all\" logging system is quite the challenge, perhaps all we should really offer is some way to check whether logging for the current module is enabled at a given logging level. People can then build their own macros that do the equivalent of\n\n```\nif logging_enabled!(ERROR) { /* do whatever */ }\n```\n\nprobably this hinges on some sort of macro so that we can have the macro be \"enabled for the current module\". As a bonus, this would probably permit us to write log statements that are enabled/disabled by the status of another module, which I've wanted on occasion.\n",

    "body": "Despite the sub-tasks of this bug mostly being done, it seems that the general feeling is that \"logging needs work\", but at least to me it's unclear what work needs to get done (or what the general vision is for a futuristic logging system). This may be the appropriate place for such a description (it would pretty much replace the current one), but a new bug would also be fine.\n\nAs mentioned on IRC though, we do have a `__log_level()` language item which returns the logging level for whatever module it was invoked inside. This should probably be put behind a macro and then we wouldn't need to reserve the `__log_level` identifier, and it should also probably be more accessible in the sense of being more well defined than just returning a `u32`\n",

    "body": "It sounds like this is all possible to do today. The `Logger` trait allows you to look at the logging level, and then you can do whatever you like with the message itself.\n\nIt doesn't sound likes it's easy to do that, though! I would err more on the side of wrapper structs that implement `Logger` that implement the functionality you're describing. For example you could have a logger which consumes other loggers to direct various messages to each one. This is all only done on a task-basis (not on a global basis), though.\n",

I am also new to the\nRust itself so many things may not be understandable for me.

I\ndidn't test it on other platforms.\n\nI. Outputing.\n- Using stderr.\n\nBy default, logging is performed to the stderr output of the process. It's a\nquite nice and intuitive feature but the way it works is a little problematic.\nIt makes you think that you are able to redirect all the logging simply by\nredirecting stderr output which unfortunately does not work! Calling\nset_stderr will only redirect fail! messages but no log! messages.\n\nMoreover, even if I spawn a task using TaskBuilder with custom stderr set upon\ncreation, the logging would not be redirected to it which is even more\ncounterintuitive.\n- Using set_logger\n\nHence, the only way to redirect the logging is using set_logger function. The\nproblem is that if I would like to redirect all logs to a custom writer I will\nhave to call it for every created task. It would be useful then if I could set\nlogger using TaskBuilder method logger() if one were added.\n- Connecting above\n\nPersonally, I like the idea that logging is connected to stderr. It seems to\nme that stderr is wastefully only used for fail! messages for now. But problems\nfrom point 1 makes it currently unusable. It would require though changing the\nLogger logic to something like LogFormatter and the user of set_log_formatter\nwould only be responsible for setting custom formating of the log messages, \nnot outputing it.\n\nHow about outputing logs to multiple sinks? I thought about possibility to set\nstderr to MultiWriter but I was not able to get it running even if all\nunderlying Writers were sendable. Is it possible to use it in such a way?\n\nII. Miscs.\n- Feature hiding\n\nIs logging system always going to be hiden inside phase plugin directive? Or\nwill it be incorporated to the std lib sometime? Typing these lines for every\nmodule seems to be a bit cumbersome.\n- static LogLocations\n\nI saw that log! macro is creating a static LogLocation struct. Does it mean\nthat for every logging macro such a structure is created in global data\nsection or is it created only once? Wouldn't it be better to simply pass line,\nfile, module_path parameters to log function?\n\nI think that's all that comes to my mind for now. Any answers will be highly \nappreciated.\n",

    "body": "@w3ln4 \n1. Currently, to change the sink for logging, you will need to call `set_logger` with your own `Logger`. This custom logger could filter records and send them to different sinks depending on your own criteria. However, you would need to call `set_logger` in every task, which is poop. The logging crate would need to store the logger in something shared between tasks, instead of task local storage.\n2. Anything in `#![features()]` are currently feature-gated. The goal is for them to become stable and no longer behind a gate, but pre-1.0, you have to opt-in to use them, agreeing that the feature could change completely.\n3. The static loglocations actually reduce the amount of code generated. I don't know the specifics, but @alexcrichton was the one who suggested it.\n",
