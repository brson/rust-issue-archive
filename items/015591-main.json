  "body": "This PR is the outcome of the library stabilization meeting for the\n`liballoc::owned` and `libcore::cell` modules.\n\nAside from the stability attributes, there are a few breaking changes:\n- The `owned` modules is now named `boxed`, to better represent its\n  contents. (`box` was unavailable, since it's a keyword.) This will\n  help avoid the misconception that `Box` plays a special role wrt\n  ownership.\n- The `AnyOwnExt` extension trait is renamed to `BoxAny`, and its `move`\n  method is renamed to `downcast`, in both cases to improve clarity.\n- The recently-added `AnySendOwnExt` extension trait is removed; it was\n  not being used and is unnecessary.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
