    "body": "You can have more than one bound, simply separate them with spaces (e.g. `T: owned copy`).\n\nThat said, I do not think an owned bound should be required here, as the type in question (`T`) appears within the `fn` type.  This rule is not correctly enforced for functions (it is correctly enforced for ifaces).  I will open a separate question on this matter.\n",
