    "body": "Just FYI, operator overloading isn't actually desguared, since desugaring happens before typechecking and we don't know if it's an overloaded operator until after then.\n\nAnyway, looks like this is a bug if the type checking for operations on primitive types. I think the fix is actually #19434, which was closed while #20749 was being resolved. Seeing as that issue _has_ now been resolved, this bug may be fixable. I don't know enough details to be sure (specifically, whether or not this bug is indeed fixable, though the fact that implementation is valid suggests that it is).\n\n@japaric @nikomatsakis?\n",
