  "body": "Because my '30 minute intro' was originally a blog post, the tone was a bit too light. It also was written a long time ago, and deserves a bit of a refresher for modern Rust. now that my work on the Guide is wrapping up, I want to give it a quick re-write as well.\n\nThis is not yet done, but I'm submitting it for feedback so far. I'd really like some comments on the ownership part in particular, which gets lower level than before, but is not strictly 100% accurate. Trying to strike a balance.\n\nIn general, I'm not sure I go into enough detail for those without systems experience, but am afraid of too much detail for those that do.\n\nRendered view: https://github.com/steveklabnik/rust/blob/intro_redux/src/doc/intro.md\n\n/cc @wycats @nikomatsakis @brson etc\n",
