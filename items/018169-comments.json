    "body": "@gamazeps Alright, I expected something like this as I was unable to figure out how to write it without `match`. I don't have much experience with statically typed languages, therefore the `enum` concept was new to me. If you are right, could we mention in the tutorial that it is actually not possible to write an equivalent solution with `if/else`? Certainly, I can't be the only one who was a bit puzzled. Cheers.\n",
