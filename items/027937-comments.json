    "body": "Can this hold off on the changes to tests/maketest for now? The changes to compiletest are only needed if tests are linking to the compiler (e.g. fulldeps), but for most targets with custom LLVM builds we probably don't need the compiler itself working there just yet, so fixes like this can come later if absolutely necessary. Same with the changes to run-make as I believe run-make isn't run for target-only targets (as opposed to host+target targets).\n\nI continue to be very wary of landing all these changes as it's quite a deal of difficult logic that isn't tested in any way, so I prefer to minimize the impact as much as possible.\n",
