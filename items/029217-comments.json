With the ValueRef being write-once in the by-value case. In the creation of the MirContext, the LValueRefs can then be created with the appropriate setting.

I am inclined to\nthink an LvalueRef _should_ always be an alloca -- that is, an Lvalue\nis a memory location, full stop.\n\nMy plan was to identify write-once temporaries whose address is never\nused and which are of immediate type and then throw those into a set\nof \"immediate temporaries\". Then when we saw an assignment to an\nimmediate temporary, we would store an OperandRef into a different\ntable (i.e., there would never be an LvalueRef for that temporary,\nbecause there is no lvalue).\n\nYou're right that this will require isolating a path for processing\nrvalues that does not take a destination. I figured we would use a\nsimilar delegating scheme, where for many rvalue types (e.g., a+b)\nthis is the primary version, and the \"into\" version just does a store.\n\nAnyway, I can try to mock this up to show you what I mean. I'm not\nsure whether it makes sense to do it in this PR or not, though.\n",

In particular d328072 adds the code you were referring to (handle references to temps that have no alloca), and 2b9233a actually skips allocas when possible. Under these changes, my sample test case produces the following IR:\n\n```\n\"BB(0)\":                                          ; preds = %entry-block\n  %2 = load i32, i32* %arg0, align 4\n  store i32 %2, i32* %x, align 4\n  %3 = load i32, i32* %arg1, align 4\n  store i32 %3, i32* %y, align 4\n  %4 = load i32, i32* %x\n  %5 = load i32, i32* %y\n  %6 = add i32 %4, %5\n  br label %\"BB(1)\"\n```\n\nThere is still a bit of indirection due to the named variables `x` and `y`, but you can see that the temporaries don't have allocas anymore. Instead, they are represented directly by `%4` and `%5`.\n",
