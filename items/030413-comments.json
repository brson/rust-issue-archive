    "body": "@GuillaumeGomez Just to be clear: The reason that I turned #30356  into this PR was that I was concerned that it was giving \"bad hints\" in some contexts.\n- I was concerned that #30356 was reporting an error mentioning a function call form like `m.f(...)` in source code contexts where there was no occurrence of `.f(...)`. \n\nI wrote up the [examples you noted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30356#issuecomment-165137689) as ways to illustrate cases where #30356 would give bad hints.\n\nBut I did _not_ intend to imply something like \"we should wait until we have solved _all_ of these cases before we land anything.\"\n\nMy intention in this PR was to continue to solve the same narrow problem that #30356 was trying to solve, but to do it in a more targeted fashion that ensures that we only provide in hint about `m.i` or `m.f(..)` in cases where there actually _is_ an `m.i` or `m.f(..)` present.\n\n---\n\nI definitely encourage you to try to come up with good error messages for other cases that this PR does not cover.  You should do that work and put it up as a separate PR.\n",
