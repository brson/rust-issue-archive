    "body": "I don't know a ton about SipHash, but, besides the small output size of 64 bits, why is it not suitable as a replacement for Sha1 for this particular purpose? As best as I can tell, SipHash is a cryptographically strong MAC function, which I believe implies it has the same basic characteristics of Sha1 (pre-image resistence, 2nd pre-image resistance, and collision resistence). It is a MAC, so it requires a key, but, using a fixed key, AFAIK, it basically acts just like Sha1 or any other cryptographic hash function. As I said, I'm no expert in SipHash, so, please correct me on anything that I'm wrong about!\n\nI certainly agree that Sha1 (or a Sha2 variant) would be a better choice. But, if those are to be removed, I'm not sure what else to use here. I guess other options would be to keep Sha1 around and maybe move it to rustpkg, but, if the goal is to get rid of cryptographic functions in the rust libraries, that doesn't seem ideal. Another option would be to write a wrapper around OpenSSL or NSS or some other library and then integrate that library into Rust. That does feel pretty heavyweight, though.\n\nI believe Rust uses SipHash to prevent DOS attacks on its hash tables. So, I don't think removing it is really possible. I don't think any of these changes increase or decrease the usability of SipHash. Was your comment mostly a general comment or is there something I did accidentally that decreased the usability of SipHash for users?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton - A couple questions:\n1. The meeting minutes (https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-10-22) say to leave in the Sha variants - does that mean leaving in Sha2 as well as Sha1?\n2. If Sha2 is to be removed, the only remaining user of Sha1 that I can find in the tree is workcache. I'm not super familiar with the workcache code, but, is it used by anything except ruskpkg? If its only used for ruskpkg, workcache and Sha1 could both be moved out of libextra and made private parts of rustpkg. If workcache does need to stay in libextra, what about allowing it to accept a hash function to use as a parameter, thus also allowing Sha1 to move out of libextra and into rustpkg?\n3. If comments should be added to Sha1 that its not suitable for cryptographic purposes, what about adding similar comments to SipHash? One use of SipHash is to prevent DOS attacks on hash tables - which is how Rust uses it. However, another use is as a MAC on short messages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash), which seems to be a cryptographic use. Should SipHash have comments added that its not suitable for crypotgraphic purposes? If I'm understanding what @blake2-ppc is saying, he advocates that such comments are not necessary, but that seems inconsistent with the direction to add those types of comments to Sha1. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, though.\n",

I think that we intend for workcache to remain part of libextra (or whatever libextra becomes), but taking a hash as a parameter and moving sha1 into rustpkg seems like a good idea to me. That being said, it certainly doesn't have to get done in this pull request, we can open an issue on this migration.\n\nI personally cannot say with 100% certainty that I'm confident that our SipHash implementation can be used for cryptographic purposes (like MACs as you mentioned), so I would be more comfortable with a message saying that we have not verified these for cryptographic use.\n\nWe will continue to fix bugs and maintain these implementations, but there's no goal for us to verify the rust codebase as suitable for crypto purposes.

    "body": "Updated the pull request. It turns out that its easier than I though to remove the uses of Sha1 from workcache - Sha1 was only being used by two functions: one of which was unused (are there plans to add a warning for unused private functions?) and the other was only used by a test. I believe that that test was just hashing small files, so, instead of hashing the file contents, I just modified the test to use the file contents directly. This wouldn't be practical for larger files, of course. But, I think its fine for the test. I moved Sha1 and supporting code over to librustpkg. I've left in the patches that add comments to the SipHash and IsaacRng code, but I'm happy to remove those patches if that's not desired. While I was making changes, I also updated workcache_support to allocate Sha1 instances on the stack instead of the heap.\n",
