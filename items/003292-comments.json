    "body": "\"rust-intrinsic\" is a special ABI for native functions that refers to a few built-in functions that the compiler can emit on demand. It's mostly for very low-level stuff like getting the alignment of types. The 'morestack_addr' intrinsic tells rustc to create a function that just returns the address of `__morestack`. Intrinsic extern modules may be declared anywhere. The attached test case illustrates how to use it though it may need to get reinterpret_casted to some other pointer type. Fixing this is the minimum we need to do to get this building everywhere and merged.\n\nI do think that the extra runtime could be related to the terminate error, though I haven't imagined exactly how.\n\nIt looks to me that the Rust ABI main function is called \"_rust_main\", so instead of asking for the address of \"main\", then executing it inside of rustllvm, we should be able to ask for \"_rust_main\", return it to rustc, then rustc can use it to synthesize a closure without an environment and call it.\n\nThis commit has an example of synthesizing a closure: 6e20ffeb8d6be059ee717993fc7ad2bcd86a0b13\n",

    "body": "Seems to be working fine! If someone can test this fixed the build issues on OSX, that would be great. I'm trying to get crate loading working and then everything should be good.\n\nEDIT: The error message is `/usr/local/lib/rustc/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libcore-c3ca5d77d81b46c1-0.3.so: cannot read file data` when I try to load the crate. However, when I try to do this in a plain C program it runs fine. It's very strange. I've tried Googling around, really can't find anything on what that error message is implying.\n",
