    "body": "I took a look at this as it seemed like possibly an easy first issue.  On Windows, `st_ctime` is indeed the file creation time - so on that platform the current implementation is correct.  On Unix platforms it is wrong as mentioned, but the `birthtime` field mentioned by @alexcrichton doesn't seem to exist outside of BSD - it's not a standard part of POSIX.\n\nDo we have any ability to have platform-dependent code in [src/libnative/io/file_unix.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b569c77148e8e839b38b678c7c167efc643d2721/src/libnative/io/file_unix.rs)?\n\nIt seems like the right approach may be to have an additional field on `FileStat` to hold the status change timestamp, which would be zero on Windows and hold the `st_ctime` value on Unix, and (possibly excepting BSD) the existing `created` field would be zero on Unix since it's unavailable.\n",
