    "body": "General remarks:\n- I think we would need special handling for `$...$` segments since they should effectively be a verbatim environment like ``...``, that is, `$x < a, y > b$` should not be turned into an HTML `<a>` tag. AFAICT, hoedown doesn't support this natively (although presumably it would be able to be hacked in by just handling `$` as a synonym for a backtick, with the appropriate matching). Also, I think this implies that this is required to be (somewhat) built-in to rustdoc; just inserting the mathjax JS into each page via `--html-after-content` won't work fully (i.e. @adrientetar's question applies to all libraries that wish to use `rustdoc`, e.g. scientific ones, physics/gamedev ones).\n- if we were doing this, it would be nice to ensure we have display math support too ([example where it would be nice](http://doc.rust-lang.org/master/std/rand/distributions/struct.Gamma.html)).\n- on that note, LaTeX-style delimiters `\\(...\\)` (inline) and `\\[...\\]` (display) are better matched than TeX `$...$` and `$$...$$` (and avoid the problem of people casually writing a `$` for money)\n- we should do something purposefully for instances of `$...$` in the comments in code blocks (i.e. make some explicit decision about how to handle it, I don't care much); `$` outside comments would need to be excluded from MathJaX (since it's an important part of macros).\n",

    "body": "@huonw thanks for the detailed response!\n- You're probably right that we'll need special handling on the server side. I didn't get very far last night due to weird compilation caching issues, so I didn't get a chance to run into that. Good catch.\n- MathJax also supports display math. Their defaults are `\\(...\\)` for inline and both `\\[...\\]` and `$$...$$` for display mode. I had opted to override this to `$$...$$` for inline and `\\[...\\]` for display (`$...$`, as you note would be a nightmare with Rust's current grammar, and I guess financial references). I picked those because the match closely to the LaTeX I've seen, but am fine with your suggestion. I basically just like `$$` because it's easy to type and looks less noisy than `\\(...\\)` to me, which seems desirable for an in-line notation.\n- With either of our proposed settings, I don't think individual `$`'s need to be addressed. As far as I can tell, you wouldn't reasonably end up with `$$` appearing in any code outside of a string literal. Maybe a weird regex or something...?\n",

    "body": "@xymostech I think our largest use case will just be asymptotics, which is trivial. Beyond that, libraries that are based on, or leverage, mathematical concepts might want to use this. Currently (in an experimental branch) we're using an external library to convert our math into the standard form MathJax supports, but it should be fairly easy to change the output to something else if necessary.\n\nI'm concerned by the statement of \"synchronous\" on the project page. I certainly don't want page loading/reading to be blocked by richly rendering the math, which likely doesn't need to be rendered instantly. I'd much rather the math be lazily rendered while the user gets their bearings quickly scanning the page for the fns they want. Also blocking (the 100% clientside) search from working while the math is trying to grind through stuff strikes me as a no-no.\n",

    "body": "@Gankro Definitely agree! Blocking UI is a big problem. I guess the point of making KaTeX synchronous is that if you want to make it asynchronous, then you can. It doesn't have to happen with page load if you don't want. If you start with it asynchronous, it's hard to go the other way and make it synchronous. We'll probably add a way to to asynchronous loading in the future. However, if you're rendering a small amount of simple expressions, KaTeX can be nearly instantaneous.\n\nLet me know if you want to try it out, I'd be happy to answer any questions along the way.\n",
