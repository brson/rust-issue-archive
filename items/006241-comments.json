    "body": "Awesome. This is an important topic and I want to think about it a bit before r+ing, maybe get the ok from @pcwalton who has opinions on this subject.\n\nWe're going to need something like this in the runtime so once it does not depend on the local heap we may end up moving it to `core::unstable` and reexporting it, or maybe just making it part of core.\n\nI've been creating a lot of these container types with `borrow_*` methods lately and feel like this needs to be extracted out into a set of traits and types for containers that obey borrow semantics. Not that we need that implemented for this pull request.\n\n:sun_with_face: \n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis and I came to the conclusion that the restriction of only containing `Owned` types is stricter than it has to be to prevent cycles.\n\nAn `Rc` can only be cyclic if it contains a non-Const type like `@mut` since the self-reference has to be added after construction. \n\nAn `RcMut` is neither `Owned` or `Const`, so only one of those bounds is needed to prevent cycles.\n\nTherefore we can have two constructors (one for `T: Owned`, one for `T: Const`) and keep the guarantee of never having cycles. This will make `Rc` usable for a recursive persistent data structure.\n",
