Take this one:\n\n```\nenum Foo { }\nfn f(f: Foo) -> int { f as int }\n```\n\nOf course this code can never be run (without `unsafe`) since `Foo` can't be constructed. The cast though is allowed even though we know it is bogus. It almost certainly represents a logic error that could be reported.\n\nBut there are a lot of other similar things we could catch, like using `match` with a zero-variant enum and the line must be drawn somewhere.\n",

If we make a conscious decision to allow uninhabited types, then it doesn't seem principled to forbid doing perfectly sound things with them.

An example would be matching an empty enum.  \n\nThis case is borderline to me because being C-like (and hence castable to uint)  is not a property that all enums share, so we can choose to say that empty enums do not have this property if we like.  However, it also seems reasonable to say \"C-like enums are those for which all variants have arguments\", in which case empty variants qualify.  In that case, I'd say that 'foo as uint' should `fail`, since there is no sensible way to codegen it.\n",

    "body": "The only thing you can cast to an empty enum is another 0-size struct, so attempting anything else will give a `transmute called on types with different sizes` error.\n\nThis test case fails with `enum value matched no variant`:\n\n```\nuse std::cast;\nuse std::io;\nenum Void { }\nstruct Foo;\nfn main() {\n    let x: Void = unsafe { cast::transmute(Foo) };\n    io::println(fmt!(\"%?\", x));\n}\n```\n\nI also can't seem to cast an empty enum to anything. The compiler says `non-scalar cast: `Void` as `uint``. So I'd say this isn't an issue.\n\nHowever, maybe we could also make the type-size of empty enums something other than 0, so even the above transmute attempt fails? Would that make sense, or would it mess up e.g. cases where you have a void inside a struct?\n",

But `ex7` did not, so I have not closed this ticket, because it seemed worth double-checking.\n\n@FlaPer87 I don't have a strong objection to making `match` on an empty-enum a compiler-error, except that it might inadvertently cause problems for certain macro- or template-instantiations that expand/monomorphize into code that has such a `match`.  (Hopefully such code would be unreachable, I am just hypothesizing here.)\n\n@glaebhoerl The question may indeed be absurd.  I did not intend to imply that I wanted a concrete definition of the behavior one gets; I just whipped up the current bug title because the previous title on the bug was misleading about the issue here.  I do not mind saying that using unsafe code to create an instance of an empty enum yields undefined behavior.  But I do think that it is worth spelling that undefined-ness here out explicitly in our documentation _somewhere_; mixing together unsafe transmutation and type-safe algebraic enums is not standard programming-language practice.  (I have seen plenty of such transmutation when _implementing_ language runtimes, but my impression is that Rust must define up front the semantics of many such interactions between unsafe constructs and the type system.)\n\nIn short, I still think it is interesting that the behavior differs so significantly between `ex6` and `ex7`, and I want to make sure that we do not accidentally include these cases in our backward-compatibility story without realizing it.\n",

    "body": "Is there a way in which constructing a value of a type which supposedly has zero values can be regarded as anything but a flagrant abuse of the type system and severely undefined behaviour?\n\nWith or without enums having an undefined representation, it seems that having a value of an uninhabited type is _horribly_ bad practice, and we don't need to specify what happens when one does occur (nasal demons and so on). \n\nIn particular, assuming that `enum Void {}` is completely non-constructable allows one to have stronger guarantees for something like\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo<T, E> { fn run(&self) -> Result<T, E>; }\n\nimpl Foo<int, Void> for PureIntCalculation {\n    fn run(&self) -> Result<int, Void> { ... }\n}\n\nimpl Foo<int, IoError> for ImpureIntCalc { ... }\n```\n\nwhere the first `impl` is effectively asserting that the `Err` variant never happens, and then we could theoretically optimise based on this, e.g. remove the discriminant in the `Result<.., Void>` case (this is getting \"dangerously\" close to (an approximation to) GADTs).\n",

    "body": "I think this is clearly undefined under the current definition of `enum`. The memory layout is undefined, so any conversion to an `enum` without a `repr` attribute is undefined behaviour. It's also already undefined behaviour to create an `enum` not specified by a variant - this is undefined for the same reason as transmuting 5 to `#[repr(int)] enum Foo { A = 3, B = 4 }` is undefined.\n",
