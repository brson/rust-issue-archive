(This _wouldn't_ allow us to drop the asserts about char boundaries, since one can still create one by hand, and `ByteIndex`s are not connected with the string from which they came.)\n\nCons: it makes manipulating strings by hand more complicated.\nPros: it makes manipulating strings by hand require more thought.\n",
