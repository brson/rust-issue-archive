Obviously less useful once we have stability post 1.0.\n\nCan I get a few more comments as to whether or not we should show a github diff URL?\n",

    "body": "@jakerr Indeed, I should have clicked on the link! As you pointed out it is more than a diff but I still think it is rather unapproachable to most present and future users of Rust. It is certainly not easy to navigate that list to learn what had changed in the language in between two versions of the compiler. If we continuously maintained `RELEASES.md` on a commit-to-commit basis then perhaps that would be a useful resource to link to.\n",

    "body": "@jakub- No worries! That's a fair assessment. I find the github diff link very useful, but it's probably because I follow the project quite closely so a quick scan of the commits is enough; but I think you're right and I'm probably not a typical user.\n",
