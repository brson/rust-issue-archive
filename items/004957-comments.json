    "body": "The idea was to be able to both query if a type supports one of the special values, and if yes, whether a value of the type is equal to one of them.\n\nBut looking over it again, the `has_*` functions could get removed althogether, with `is_*` returning `false` taking on the double meaning 'no/does not apply'. And those could simply be standalone functions, yes. I'm gonna make the necessary changes. (Though ideally the trait would become an private implementation detail anyway, but yeah no reason for it to be needlessly complex)\n",
