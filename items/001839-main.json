  "body": "This implements the compiler changes necessary to generate Rust functions that can be called from C.\n\nHere's an example of how it works:\n\nhttps://github.com/brson/rust/blob/crust/src/test/run-pass/crust-call-scrub.rs\n\nThe syntax and typing (they're all *u8) of these functions is not that satisfactory, but I guess we can improve it later.\n\nI made 'crust' a function purity in the AST, which is not all that true. Cross-crate crust functions also don't work yet. So there's some more work to be done, but this includes all the important mechanics.\n",
