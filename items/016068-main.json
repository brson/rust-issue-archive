  "body": "librustc: Implement arbitrary lifetimes in trait objects. \u2026\n\nAll trait objects must be annotated with a lifetime. This means that\ncode like this breaks:\n\n```\nfn f(x: Box<Trait>) { ... }\n\nfn g<'a>(x: &'a Trait) { ... }\n```\n\nChange this code to:\n\n```\nfn f(x: Box<Trait+'static>) { ... }\n\nfn g<'a>(x: &'a Trait<'a>) { ... }\n```\n\nThis will be eventually addressed by some additions that @nikomatsakis\nwants. However, the fundamental thrust of this change is necessary to\nachieve memory safety. Further additions to improve ergonomics will\nfollow.\n\nCloses #5723.\n\nr? @nikomatsakis\n",
