    "body": "I don't know. There is a full spectrum here, including the difference between (1) case mapping needed for `to_upper / to_lower` and (2) case folding needed for case insensitive comparison.\n\n> http://www.unicode.org/faq/casemap_charprop.html#5  \n> Q: Does the default case mapping work for every language? What about the default case folding?\n> \n> A: The Unicode Standard defines the default case mapping for each individual character, with each character considered in isolation. This mapping does not provide for the context in which the character appears, nor for the language-specific rules that must be applied when working in natural language text.\n> \n> By contrast, case folding, which is based on the lowercase mapping, is intended to be language-neutral. Since the case folding rules do not vary by language or context, this makes them unsuitable as the basis for displaying or transforming text for human consumption.\n> \n> To make case mapping language sensitive, the Unicode Standard specificially allows\u2014but does not provide the necessary data\u2014implementations to tailor the mappings for each language. The file SpecialCasing.txt is included in the Standard as a guide to a few of the more important individual character mappings needed for specific languages, notably the Greek script and the Turkic languages. However, for most language-specific mappings and tailoring, users should refer to CLDR and other resources.\n\nI guess that `UnicodeData.txt` + parts of `SpecialCasing.txt` will be the best Rust can do without a huge unicode library(?)\n",
