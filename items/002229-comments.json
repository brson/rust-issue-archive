I also don't like the idea of using `pass` as a keyword for this specific use, because, as Wensleydale said, `pass` means something completely different in Python (if that's the intended reason to use that keyword). I also don't think it really addresses the original problem (`pass foo` is just as weird as `skip foo`).\n\nI do like the `skip` keyword. I think it pretty clearly says what the keyword is doing.\n",
