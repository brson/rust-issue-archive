Here's some example code that illustrates what I mean where `my_low_level_code`, and `my_main` are defined elsewhere.\n\n``` rust\nuse std::rt;\n\n#[cfg(test)]\n#[start]\nfn start(argc: int, argv: **u8, crate_map: *u8) -> int {\n    my_low_level_code();\n    do rt::start_on_main_thread(argc, argv, crate_map) {\n        rt::start_test_runner(argc, argv, crate_map);\n    }\n}\n\n#[cfg(not(test))]\n#[start]\nfn start(argc: int, argv: **u8, crate_map: *u8) -> int {\n    my_low_level_code();\n    do rt::start_on_main_thread(argc, argv, crate_map) {\n         my_main();\n    }\n}\n```\n",
