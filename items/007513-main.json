  "body": "The Base64 package previously had extremely basic functionality. It only\nsuported the standard encoding character set, didn't support line breaks\nand always padded output. This commit makes it significantly more\npowerful.\n\nThe FromBase64 impl now supports all of the standard variants of Base64.\nIt ignores newlines,interprets '-' and '_' as well as '+' and '/' and\ndoesn't require padding. It isn't incredibly pedantic and will\nsuccessfully parse strings that are not strictly valid, but I don't\nthink the extra complexity required to make it accept _only_ valid\nstrings is worth it.\n\nThe ToBase64 trait has been modified such that to_base64 now takes a\nbase64::Config struct which contains the output format configuration.\nThis currently includes the selection of character set (standard or\nurl safe), whether or not to pad and an optional line break width. The\npackage comes with three static Config structs for the RFC 4648\nstandard, RFC 4648 url safe and RFC 2045 MIME formats.\n\nThe other option for configuring ToBase64 output would be to have one\nmethod with the configuration flags passed and other traits with default\nimpls for the common cases, but I think that's a little messier.\n\nFromBase64 still kills the task if you pass it invalid input, which isn't\nparticularly appropriate for a function into which you'll be passing\nunvalidated input. Would it be worth changing its signature to return a\nResult?\n",
