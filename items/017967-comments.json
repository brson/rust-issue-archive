    "body": "Reopening because this is still broken, and for an especially pernicious reason. The guide automatically tests code examples by running each code snippet in isolation. The following snippet, as tested by the docs, is completely legal _by itself_:\n\n``` rust\nfn cmp(a: int, b: int) -> Ordering {\n    if a < b { Less }\n    else if a > b { Greater }\n    else { Equal }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = 5i;\n    let y = 10i;\n\n    let ordering = cmp(x, y);\n\n    if ordering == Less {\n        println!(\"less\");\n    } else if ordering == Greater {\n        println!(\"greater\");\n    } else if ordering == Equal {\n        println!(\"equal\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n...**however**, if you do the sensible thing and concat the two separate code examples together, as a learner would expect, _it suddenly fails to compile_:\n\n``` rust\nenum Ordering {\n    Less,\n    Equal,\n    Greater,\n}\n\nfn cmp(a: int, b: int) -> Ordering {\n    if a < b { Less }\n    else if a > b { Greater }\n    else { Equal }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = 5i;\n    let y = 10i;\n\n    let ordering = cmp(x, y);\n\n    if ordering == Less {  // error: binary operation `==` cannot be applied to type `Ordering`\n        println!(\"less\");\n    } else if ordering == Greater {\n        println!(\"greater\");\n    } else if ordering == Equal {\n        println!(\"equal\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is because the `Ordering` enum here is really just a copy of the `Ordering` enum that is defined in the standard library and imported automatically by the prelude. So when you try the first code snippet, the one without the enum definition, it works by looking at the implicitly-imported variants. But when you define `Ordering` yourself, it _shadows_ the existing variants, and because you don't have `PartialEq` derived it will fail inexplicably.\n\nSomeone remind me, why do we have `Ordering` in the prelude at all?\n\ncc @steveklabnik \n",

    "body": "I got stuck here for a while too. I missed the part about it being in Rust standard library and was quite confused about why OptionalInt enum requires the namespace prefix later in the doc. but Ordering didn't and assumed it might be implicit and that namespaces are optional.\n\nOnly after I tried the Ordering example and got the following error did I realize that namspace is a must. The example in the original post above does work if enum values are prefixed with namespace.\n\n```\nordering.rs:8:16: 8:20 error: mismatched types: expected `Ordering`, found `core::cmp::Ordering` (expected enum Ordering, found enum core::cmp::Ordering)\nordering.rs:8     if a < b { Less }\n                             ^~~~\n```\n",
