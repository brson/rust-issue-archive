    "body": "I am not thrilled about this approach. It definitely seems ad-hoc but the the only other solution I could think of would I think be inferior.\n\nSo the other option I've considered was not to do any of the inlining this PR encompasses and completely exclude references to static items from exhaustiveness analysis, which I think would be really confusing.\n\nWhat would also follow from that is that those patterns would have to be treated specially in the decision tree construction in trans/_match.rs because in:\n\n``` rust\nstatic FOO = Some(true);\nmatch x {\n    Some(false) => (),\n    FOO => (),\n    None => ()\n}\n```\n\nValues `x` that are of variant Some would have to be tested against multiple separate branches in the decision tree: one that is expanded from all the inline patterns that match values of variant Some, in this case `Some(false)`, and one for each pattern that is just a static identifier, like `FOO`.\n\nWe already kind of do it for slice patterns and I think that's bad. I'd expect that the decision tree that a match expression is compiled to would not differ based on whether the arms are referring to static items or are \"inlined\" by the user.\n\nThe hack I've put in in resolve is definitely not going to stay, by the way.\n\n@pcwalton @edwardw I would very much appreciate your feedback on this.\n",

If it's a mutable static, it means you intend to mutate it in an unsafe block which means we can't inline them at compile-time.\n\nSo what happens in all your examples is that `OFF` is treated as an identifier that catches all values. Same thing in master: http://is.gd/HeIF6z. We do need a warning of some sort, though.\n",

This time it failed on the test `compile-fail/match-ill-type-2.rs` (that is, it successfully compiled it) but only on the optimised 32-bit Windows build. The test isn't _really_ related.\n\nIt'd be nice to be able to SSH into that build agent and poke around with RUST_LOG.\n\nMy conservative assumption is this patch causes rustc to miscompile itself at the last stage in some very peculiar way...\n",
