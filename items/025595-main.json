  "body": "When taking the address of an unsized field we generate a rvalue datum\nfor the field and then convert it to an lvalue datum. At that point,\ncleanup is scheduled for the field, leading to multiple drop calls.\n\nThe problem is that we generate an rvalue datum for the field, since the\npointer does not own the data and there's already cleanup scheduled\nelsewhere by the true owner. Instead, an lvalue datum must be created.\n\nThanks to @eddyb for identifying the underlying cause and suggesting the\ncorrect fix.\n\nFixes #25549.\n",
