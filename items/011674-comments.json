Additionally, this is missing _a lot_ of macros defined by the compiler.\n\nWith bors's queue so full right now, I would rather take the time to fix this properly rather than just inching it forward a little bit.\n\nWhat do you think about this? I'd almost think that this section should get removed because there's no way for it to stay up to date.\n",
