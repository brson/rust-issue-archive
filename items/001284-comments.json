    "body": "I don't know what Rust's abi rules are, but for every platform I know of, f32 is 32-bit aligned in C, so padding shouldn't be an issue. You may still need to have complex types be handled natively in order to deal with ABI differences between complex and structs\u2014for example, on x86-64, `_Complex long double` return values are returned on the x87 stack, where as a struct of long doubles would be returned in memory. I think there's at least one x86-32 platform that also returns `_Complex float` and `double` values using a special rule (though I forget which). Perhaps you could handle the different ABI with a type attribute, though.\n",
