    "body": "FWIW, I believe that the situation has changed so dramatically since this ticket was filed that I would personally feel fine with closing it.\r\n\r\nThere have been two related efforts:\r\n\r\n - eliminate hard stops in the compiler, allowing recovery and continuing later stages; I would say we aren't 100% done, but all but the absolutely hardest cases have been addressed\r\n - avoid redundant errors from later stages caused by invalid state from earlier stages; I believe we're in a good state nowadays, certainly compared to where we were in 2016\r\n\r\nThere are other changes being made to help in the spirit of this ticket (changing the representation of `ErrorGuaranteed` to hold extra information comes to mind), but I feel like smaller, more targeted tickets (\"under X circumstances, we get Y output which is too much/not enough\") will make it easier for contributors to make progress towards the goal of \"present the user *all* the necessary errors, and nothing more\".",
