    "body": "I've injected this `$(document).keyup(function (e) { console.log(e) })` code into the page via the browsers' console. In Firefox, the `key` property of the event has the contains the `?`. On IE the `char` property has it. In chromium, the website works properly as it is now, it fires an event with a `which` of 191. Now that Opera uses blink and V8, I think it's safe to say it should behave like chrome. Since blink is a fork of Webkit, the same behavior could be expected with Webkit based browsers.\n\nI knew key events were poorly standardized, but not that much. Anyway, to resolve the issue, a better approach might be `if (e.char === '?' || e.key === '?' || e.which === 191) { ... }`.\n",
