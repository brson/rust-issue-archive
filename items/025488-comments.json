    "body": "That's an interesting failure mode; i.e. you were forced to say the `Vec` type explicitly, but the language lets you leave out the element type via `Vec<_>`.  And then it inferred that the element type is `()` since that is the result of the `map` callback, due to the semicolon after `thread::spawn` that was noted in the description...\n\nerror reporting for type inference errors is a notoriously difficult area, but we probably could do more here.  Even just special casing `()`, since the presence/absence of a semi-colon is an easy thing to overlook, might be useful.\n\n(by \"special-casing `()`\", I mean something hacky like tracking when we infer a unification-variable to be `()`, and then if that ends up being involved with a type error down the road, then report the chain of inference decisions that led to the `()` being introduced.)\n",
