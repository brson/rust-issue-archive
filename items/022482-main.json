  "body": "This commit is an implementation of [RFC 592](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0592-c-str-deref.md) and [RFC 840](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0840-no-panic-in-c-string.md). These\ntwo RFCs tweak the behavior of `CString` and add a new `CStr` unsized slice type\nto the module.\n\nThe new `CStr` type is only constructable via two methods:\n1. By `deref`'ing from a `CString`\n2. Unsafely via `CStr::from_ptr`\n\nThe purpose of `CStr` is to be an unsized type which is a thin pointer to a\n`libc::c_char` (currently it is a fat pointer slice due to implementation\nlimitations). Strings from C can be safely represented with a `CStr` and an\nappropriate lifetime as well. Consumers of `&CString` should now consume `&CStr`\ninstead to allow producers to pass in C-originating strings instead of just\nRust-allocated strings.\n\nA new constructor was added to `CString`, `new`, which takes `T: IntoBytes`\ninstead of separate `from_slice` and `from_vec` methods (both have been\ndeprecated in favor of `new`). The `new` method returns a `Result` instead of\npanicking.  The error variant contains the relevant information about where the\nerror happened and bytes (if present). Conversions are provided to the\n`io::Error` and `old_io::IoError` types via the `FromError` trait which\ntranslate to `InvalidInput`.\n\nThis is a breaking change due to the modification of existing `#[unstable]` APIs\nand new deprecation, and more detailed information can be found in the two RFCs.\nNotable breakage includes:\n- All construction of `CString` now needs to use `new` and handle the outgoing\n  `Result`.\n- Usage of `CString` as a byte slice now explicitly needs a `.as_bytes()` call.\n- The `as_slice*` methods have been removed in favor of just having the\n  `as_bytes*` methods.\n\nCloses #22469\nCloses #22470\n[breaking-change]\n",
