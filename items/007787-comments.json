    "body": "Certainly a good idea, but I'm not really happy with this in its current form.\n- I'd like it to work on saved files, too, with their proper names, only going via stdin `if &modified`.\n- This leaves behind in the working directory a binary `stdin~`; it should be removed (I don't understand why `rust run` leaves it around, to be frank)\n- `/dev/stdin` isn't cross-platform. It should be using `-` which `rust run`... supports in concept as \"stdin\", but breaks on in linking. TODO: file bug about that (going to bed now). We're probably best to bypass `rust run` and invoke `rustc` and the resulting file directly: You could do something along the lines of:\n  \n  ```\n  let s:tempname = tempname()\n  exec \"!rustc - -o \" . s:tempname\n  exec \"%!\" . s:tempname\n  unlet s:tempname\n  ```\n  \n  Actually, on second thoughts, `tempname()` might not be such a good idea\u2014the working directory will still be right, but the binary directory wouldn't be, which could potentially cause trouble for some code. Could go for a name like `./.vim-rust-run-binary`, I guess. Oh, and on Windows it'll need to end in .exe.\n- It'd be kinda nifty if it tied into the rustc compiler (which would need some modification to fit with it, to support a `-o X` option at least), so that you'd replace the `:!rustc` step with `:make`, with the effect that compile errors would be handled normally. (Danger there: it would at present then try to show you the errors in a buffer with the filename `<anon>`. I guess adding another set of errorformat lines before the others with the <anon> hardcoded would more or less fix that up, though if you use other files it would still get hairy.)\n\nWhat do you think?\n",
