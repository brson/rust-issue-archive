The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

However, it would be unstable at 1.0 and is mostly an implementation detail, but using it in `PartialEq` may be tricky in that case as @alexcrichton points out (especially so under this scheme, since there's no way to have a stable generic wrapper).\n",

    "body": "Just to clarify for those that aren't as familiar with this part of the compiler internals, we _always_ have a discriminant value for an enum, sometimes we read from a memory location, sometimes we do a comparison against a pointer value, but there is _always_ an discriminant.\n\nRight now, I don't think the specific values need to be specced at all. I think that, if we decide to spec anything here at all, it should simply be that the value you get is guaranteed only to be the same value as any another instance of the variant of the same type. This does mean we can't use the value for ordering, but it also means we don't have to worry about the various representations.\n",

We think that a similar strategy may be able to happen here as well. As is this is a pretty unobtrusive feature, and the perf wins it may gain us are certainly quite enticing!\n\nOur conclusion was that if we have a concrete use case for this in the standard libraries that it'd be a good thing to land, but otherwise it may want to hold of for an RFC. I'd of course be willing to help out writing an RFC and sheperding it through as well!\n\nIn general we'd just want to make sure that it's put to good use in the standard library before landing an implementation in the compiler. Thanks again for the awesome perf work here!\n",
