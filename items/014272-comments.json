    "body": "> in the ideal world this macro is not as necessary with proper checking for expressions that can be repeated\n\nTrue, and that reminds me, I meant to mention the related issues. Although even fixing that won't remove the need for `ary![]`, as things like `ary![Vec::new(), ..64]` are still useful.\n\nI'm open to feature gating if necessary. Presumably a decision would be made about it after the relevant tickets have been fixed and we can better evaluate how useful this is. Putting it in a separate library might be a bit much, I feel like saying `#[feature(phase)] #[phase(syntax)] extern crate ary;` is a lot of boilerplate if I just need `ary![]` once or twice.\n",
