    "body": "Something interesting came up.\n\nThe summary of the fix for this issue is that static items won't be allowed for types that own  `destructors`, `managed pointers` or `owned pointers`. Although this rule seems reasonable, we've hit some cases where abusing of the lack of this rule was actually useful.\n\nThe first case, and perhaps the least invasive one, is the `DUMMY_SP` static item defined in `codemap`. It has a field that contains a managed pointer, hence it can't be the type of a static item. This case was replaced with a function `DUMMY_SP()` and all the references to that static item where changed.\n\nThe second case is for the static items defined in [`rustc::middle::ty` ](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/ty.rs#L569). Although this case is very similar to the previous one, it's different in terms of the values being stored in the static item. In this case the enum type [`sty`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/ty.rs#L611) has a `ty_tuple(~[T])` variant, however the static items created don't store that variant.\n\nThis last case is an example that suggest enforcing static restrictions on the values as opposed of types as a better solution.\n\nAfter chatting with @nikomatsakis on IRC, it seems that enforcing these rules on the values is not especially hard. There are some cases to consider for `static mut` items. We could loosen the rules for immutable static items and make them harder for mutable static items.\n\nI've pushed the latest version of the work. As already mentioned, `DUMMY_SP` was replaced with `DUMMY_SP()` whereas the static items in `rustc::middle::ty` haven't been changed.\n\nThoughts?\n",

The necessary restrictions are all implied by checking the initializer expression instead.\n",
