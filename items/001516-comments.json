    "body": "I disagree with my past self about whether this should compile. Right now, in the AST, there's only one way to introduce a diverging function: by writing a `!` in place of its return type. Return styles are never inferred. Making closure potentially-diverging would require significant changes. It's possible, but it would add more outside-of-the-type-system baggage, if you know what I mean.\n\nI'm going to close this, but @brson or anyone else, please file an RFC if you feel strongly about it :-)\n",
