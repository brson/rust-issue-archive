    "body": "As I mentioned on IRC, I'm not sure if I think that splitting out \"diverging call\" into its own terminator is a good idea. My concerns are:\n1. Duplication: it's harder to know that you're getting all calls.\n2. If you have `foo = diverging_fn()`, we need to still consider that a \"write\" to `foo` in a logical sense (i.e., for the purposes of borrowck). To do that under the approach of this PR, we'll need some marker that `foo` has been initialized, since `DivergingCall` no longer has a destination.\n\nBasically, I'm not sure if the code for handling calls vs diverging calls will wind up being so very different in other passes. But it's a bit hard to know just now. A compromise might just be to introduce an enum into the call that is either `NormalCall(BasicBlock, BasicBlock)` or `DivergingCall(BasicBlock)`.\n\nIn any case, let me read further before reaching final judgement.\n",

Some of these commits get pretty involved, but that may just be unavoidable if we want to generate less naive IR. Calls are just complicated. :) Anyway, so I'm leaning now towards landing this PR and then trying to keep improving things. One thing which would be nice are some more test cases for calls that generate `invoke`, and in particular to exercise some of those edge cases paths (like `loop { c = call(); }`). \n",
