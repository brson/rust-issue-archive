  "body": "A major discoverability issue with rustdoc is that all crates have their\ndocumentation built in isolation, so it's difficult when looking at the\ndocumentation for libstd to learn that there's a libcollections crate with a\nHashMap in it.\n\nThis commit moves rustdoc a little closer to improving the multiple crate\nexperience. This unifies all search indexes for all crates into one file so all\npages share the same search index. This allows searching to work across crates\nin the same documentation directory (as the standard distribution is currently\nbuilt).\n\nThis strategy involves updating a shared file amongst many rustdoc processes, so\nI implemented a simple file locking API for handling synchronization for updates\nto the shared files.\n\ncc #12554\n",
