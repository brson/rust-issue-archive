  "body": "This commit removes all usage of conditions from the runtime and I/O\nimplementation. The new idea is to return IoResult which is a typedef on\nResult<T, IoError>. The error portion of this may wish to change in the future,\nbut for now it's a good step forward to remove conditions.\n\nSome notable changes:\n- the `if_ok!`/`seq!` macros -- right now these are only defined in libstd, but they're definitely in the wrong spot and may belong in the core-macro injection as well.\n- Removed ByteIterator - no way to propagate I/O errors any more\n- The fmt traits must now return IoResult<()> - need to propagate errors\n- All I/O errors in json encoding/decode are now ignored\n- All I/O errors in rustdoc are now ignored\n- The signature of print/println has changed - need to propagate the error\n- The signature of read_bytes() has changed - need to return partially-read data\n\nThis is not quite ready for merging just yet. I'd like to get some feedback on this before cleaning this up for a true merge. I don't like how errors are default not-fatal any more, but the code isn't really that much less readable in my opinion. There's also not a lot of heavy I/O code except for rustdoc which just ignores all errors, so this perhaps isn't the best showcase of conversion.\n\nI'm mainly soliciting for feedback about this. I think that this is the right way to go in general (moving away from conditions), but if there are any reservations about the specifics we should probably discuss them now.\n",
