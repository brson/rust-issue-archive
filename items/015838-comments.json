    "body": "Result of audit:\n\nFor the `fn` case, the RFC example was a little more elaborate than what we do today, in that it proposed also including the text (adapted to @nikomatsakis 's example):\n\n> this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `s` or `t`. Mark the input parameter it borrows from using lifetimes, e.g. [generated example]. See [url] for an introduction to lifetimes.\n\nwhere presumably `[generated example]` is meant to denote something like: `fn test<'a>(s: &'a str, t: &str) -> &'a str`, and `[url]` is meant to be a link to some docs.\n\nI don't think these additional sentences are crucial.  They certainly are not a 1.0 blocker.\n\n---\n\nFor the `impl` case: \n\nFirst off, the error scenario for the `impl` case was explicitly stated to be rare in the RFC itself.  (But then again, a pattern that is rare today may become more prevalent in the future...)\n\nPerhaps more importantly: As far as I can tell, the lifetime elision rules for the impl case do not actually appear to be implemented today.  In particular, both of the following examples cause compiler errors today:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo<'a> { fn foo(&self) -> &'a u32; }\nstruct Bar0(&'static u32, &'static u32);\nimpl Foo for Bar0 { fn foo(&self) -> &u32 { self.0 } }\nfn main() { }\n```\n\n[playpen](http://is.gd/E0OTby) yields:\n\n```\n<anon>:3:6: 3:9 error: wrong number of lifetime parameters: expected 1, found 0 [E0107]\n<anon>:3 impl Foo for Bar0 { fn foo(&self) -> &u32 { self.0 } }\n              ^~~\n```\n\nAnd perhaps more importantly (in terms of a useful case where elision could well apply):\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo<'a> { fn foo(&self) -> &'a u32; }\nstruct Bar1<'b>(&'b u32, &'b u32);\nimpl Foo for Bar1 { fn foo(&self) -> &u32 { self.0 } }\nfn main() { }\n```\n\n[playpen](http://is.gd/XkCqp0) yields: \n\n```\n<anon>:3:14: 3:18 error: wrong number of lifetime parameters: expected 1, found 0 [E0107]\n<anon>:3 impl Foo for Bar1 { fn foo(&self) -> &u32 { self.0 } }\n                      ^~~~\n<anon>:3:6: 3:9 error: wrong number of lifetime parameters: expected 1, found 0 [E0107]\n<anon>:3 impl Foo for Bar1 { fn foo(&self) -> &u32 { self.0 } }\n              ^~~\nerror: aborting due to 2 previous errors\n```\n\nSo therefore it is not currently relevant how we handle the case below; it will just error due to the missing parameters, and so we need not yet worry about the \"cliff\" between the above two cases and this one.\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo<'a> { fn foo(&self) -> &'a u32; }\nstruct Bar2<'b,'c>(&'b u32, &'c u32);\nimpl Foo for Bar2 { fn foo(&self) -> &u32 { self.0 } }\nfn main() { }\n```\n\n[playpen](http://is.gd/TOC0i3)\n",
