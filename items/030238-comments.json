The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nrc (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis Sorry for the delay - school just finished up for the semester, so I should have more time.\n\nIt just occurred to me that this, as currently implemented, can devolve into _O(n log n)_ behavior. For example, if we have\n\n```\nA -> B -> C -> D\n```\n\nthen a single pass will merge `B` onto the end of `A` and `D` onto the end of `C`, but will not actually merge `AB` and `CD`. A second pass will catch this, but this takes more work than just directly merging everything into `A`. I'll post a fix shortly.\n",

It already keeps the predecessor map up-to-date, so just make sure the unreachable blocks have already been removed before running it, then remove any newly-unreachable blocks afterwards.\n\nIt's also pointless to run `simplify_branches` after this, as it won't introduce any new branches so `simplify_branches` could probably be made self-contained too. This would make `SimplifyCfg`'s `run_on_mir` look something like this:\n\n``` rust\nsimplify_branches();\nremove_dead_blocks();\nmerge_consecutive_blocks();\nremove_dead_blocks();\n```\n",
