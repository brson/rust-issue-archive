    "body": "I was thinking... I would perhaps like to go the opposite direction and make bind _more_ special.  The idea would be to omit the bind keyword, as in Scala.  This would allow constructs like:\n\n```\nint::range(0, 10, _).filter(is_even, _).to_list();\n```\n\nIn an ideal world, we could even support things like \"_ + _\" (which work in Scala).  When you go that far, though, the tricky part is to decide where the bind boundary is... for example, is \"_.foo(_)\" equivalent to \"bind _.foo(_)\" or \"bind _.foo(bind _)\"?  Both make sense (Here, `bind _` would effectively be the identity function).  \n\nStill, writing \"my_vec.foldl(0, _ + _)\" is pretty nice.\n\nAnyway, the way I thought to implement this kind of thing (and to rewrite bind) is basically to have an AST node similar to the one which represents \"{||...}\" closures right now.  So we'd get the inference of what kind of closure it is \"for free\".  \n",
