Right now dep-info doesn't track any dependencies, and I think that's more of a job for a package manager rather than rustc itself. I don't know what the makefile target dependency would be named. In theory it could be `libstd-...rlib`, but that doesn't actually correspond to anything because you'd then have to make a target saying that that points to (and things go on...)\n",

E.g. a library might have some examples which depend on the library being built. `--dep-info` will not be able to return that dependency because the library wasn't built yet and therefore the file doesn't exist yet.\n",
