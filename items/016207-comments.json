    "body": "> Sans-serif fonts are generally considered better for the web\n\nReally?\n\nLet&rsquo;s see what typographers have to say here:\n\n> Against common beliefs, both serif and sans serif can perform equally well, if you choose a body text size above 12 pixels. Below 12 pixels serifed typefaces don\u2019t render sharply enough, but (and this brings us to the second point) on contemporary monitors 12 pixels is definitely too small anyway.\n\nhttp://ia.net/blog/responsive-typography-the-basics/\n\n> The reason I have made this change is that sans-serif fonts are significantly more common on the web than serif ones.\n\nSo...?\n\n> Looking at Python\u2019s docs, MDN, Java\u2019s docs, and practically any random website I come across, I see nothing but sans-serif fonts for the body text.\n\nAgain: so what?\n\nThe [Racket Docs](http://docs.racket-lang.org/getting-started/index.html) do and they were conceived by a professional typographer and type designer, Matthew Butterick (@mbutterick).\n\nActually, he also did a [redesign mockup of the Python docs with an extensive explanation](http://practicaltypography.com/websites.html); I would advise you to check that out to learn more.\n\n> Many websites seem to recommend using sans-serif fonts for the web.\n\nDesigners sometimes lack a proper knowledge of type and typography (which is sad because it's a core element of design). Now what do typographers say?\n\n> On the web, body text can be in a sans serif or serif font. Sans ser\u00adifs were once pre\u00adferred for screen text be\u00adcause they ren\u00addered bet\u00adter on the low\u00ader-res\u00ado\u00adlu\u00adtion screens of the past. (That\u2019s why most graph\u00adi\u00adcal user in\u00adter\u00adfaces are built around sans serif fonts). But on to\u00adday\u2019s screens, serif fonts look equal\u00adly good.\n\nhttp://practicaltypography.com/body-text.html\n\nNow reading the original issue, I came across weird things, like this for example:\n\n> Although I do prefer the 16px style, **I have to admit that the majority of sites seem to have a font size around 14px** (Github, MDN, etc.) **so I think that the 14px option is probably best**.\n\n??  \nRust is cutting-edge in many fields, why shouldn&rsquo;t it be so with its web design also?\n\n[\"But bad habits don\u2019t be\u00adcome good habits through rep\u00ade\u00adti\u00adtion.\"](http://practicaltypography.com/websites.html)\n\n> Currently we find between 16 and 22 px to be reasonable for desktop webpages\n\nhttp://blog.weare1910.com/post/72755990718/grids-from-typography\n\nThe guys up here are designers but they know about type. They start on a grid and define the typeface before anything else happens.\n\nBTW, it&rsquo;s always good to cc the person who added something when you&rsquo;re removing it.\n\nBottom line: if we are doing this here, I&rsquo;d at least want it to be for good reasons (reason, reasoning&hellip; same root), not just &ldquo;hey look, the websites I browse usually use a 14px sans-serif font&hellip;&rdquo;.\n",

    "body": "> Let\u2019s see what typographers have to say here: [...]\n\nI\u2019m not talking about readability here, I\u2019m talking about style. Rust\u2019s documentation shouldn\u2019t have a style that seems too formal and (perhaps to some people) old-fashioned, it needs to look modern.\n\nIn general I do actually prefer serif typefaces, however I consider sans-serif more appropriate for Rust\u2019s documentation.\n\n> Actually, he also did a redesign mockup of the Python docs with an extensive explanation\n\nI mentioned that very redesign in the original thread: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/16173#issuecomment-50948152. It uses sans-serif fonts. That\u2019s not necessarily saying that we should _definitely_ go with sans-serif, but it\u2019s still a point. (Although your point that the Racket docs that the same person designed use serif fonts is equally valid.)\n\n>  Rust is cutting-edge in many fields, why shouldn\u2019t it be so with its web design also?\n\nIn reflection I\u2019m not really sure what I was saying there. I suppose it has precedent, and people are used to it. These websites have at least _some_ sense of design (MDN & GitHub, at least). But I do certainly agree that sticking with bad habits is a bad idea. This discussion is really about whether or not it _is_ a bad habit. (I think there are _some_ places where more serifs would be good, just maybe not docs.)\n\n> BTW, it\u2019s always good to cc the person who added something when you\u2019re removing it.\n\nSorry about that; it completely slipped my mind to notify you.\n\n> if we are doing this here, I\u2019d at least want it to be for good reasons\n\nI agree wholeheartedly. I suppose my reason[ing] is something along these lines:\n- Sans-serif, at least to me, looks more modern and suitable for a programming language\n- The old font looked slightly out of place somehow. Maybe it was just too small too look good to me (I tend to prefer larger serif fonts to smaller ones), I don\u2019t know. Probably I\u2019m just biased. Maybe it\u2019s because the fixed-width font is also sans-serif.\n- Some people found the old font blurry (well, at least @mahkoh did).\n\nBut design isn\u2019t about hard-and-fast rules, it\u2019s about opinions and \u2018looking right\u2019. The real question is whether or not it \u2018looks right\u2019 to _everyone_.\n",
