    "body": "Thanks! Pull request comments are usually proportional to the complexity of or justification required for a change. \nSimple changes don't require more than a sentence or two.\n\nIn the future you'll want to submit pull requests against the `incoming` branch, not `master` (there's a dropdown for it when creating the pull request). That will prevent the pull request from displaying a bunch of unrelated commits. I've sorted this one out though, so no worries.\n",
