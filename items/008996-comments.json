    "body": "Some more thoughts:\n\nmingw-w64 has no 'official' binary: I think [mingw-builds](http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php#mingw-builds) is most widely used, but I guess rubenvb's personal build is also quite popular.\n\n For mingw-builds, there are many options available: platform (win32/win64), thread model (posix/win32 for both platform) and stack unwinding model (sjlj/dwarf for 32-bit, sjlj/seh for 64-bit). I've only used win32 (threads) and dwarf/win32 & seh/win64 (unwinding) so far. We have to choose some model among them for 'official' rust binary because performance and compatibility matter.\n\nOn stack unwinding models:\n- DWARF is what we currently use on mingw. [No dwarf on win64](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mingw-w64/wiki/Exception%20Handling).\n- SJLJ is slow, but portable.\n- SEH is \"native\" windows model. 32-bit SEH != 64-bit SEH. Both mingw and mingw-w64 dont't support 32-bit SEH due to [patent issues](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-July/004692.html). Don't know how llvm supports 64-bit SEH well. (See comments at #7953)\n\nActually I've already built win32 rust on mingw-w64 (platform 32-bit, threads win32, exception dwarf), but `make check-fast` failed mysteriously and rustc works horribly slowly. I don't know any details so far. Anyone who tried this before?\n",

Of note is the inclusion of Clang with rubenvb's builds.... that alone might sway a vote of confidence.

    "body": "Yes, rustc built with mingw-w64 (from mingw-builds) is very slow.   Profiling points towards libwinpthreads' implementation of mutexes.   I've checked out the source, and apparently they are implemented using Windows semaphores, which would explain why they are so slow:  win32 semaphores are kernel objects, so every lock/unlock entails a syscall.\n\nOn the other hand, pthreads-win32 library, used by the regular mingw, looks much more reasonable - it first tries to obtain a lock via interlocked exchange, and only then falls back onto syscalls.\n\nHere's the bug I've opened in mingw-w64 issue tracker: https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/bugs/344/\n",

    "body": "(NOTE: here `i686-w64-mingw32` means mingw-w64 32bit (`i686`), and `i686-pc-mingw` means mingw what we use. Yes it's confusing...)\n\nIf you run `../configure && make` on `i686-w64-mingw32`, `configure` thinks [it's on `i686-pc-mingw32`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/configure#L274-L276), and downloads corresponding snapshot then build stage2. I've checked it last week and it even passed `make check`. The only issue I've found is that `rustc.exe -v` shows `host: i686-pc-mingw32`.\nSimilarly, you may provide `i686-w64-mingw32` \"bootstrap\" binary by copying mingw one. (I haven't tried this)\n\nIn the other hand, mingw-w64 provides [a lot of options](http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php#mingw-builds): exception model (dwarf / sjlj) and threading model (win32 / posix). I'm curious if this affects some compatibility.\nDebian provides sjlj-win32. Our mingw uses dwarf-win32. I've always used dwarf-win32 but I got rustc.exe which is slower than @luqmana's one (from #10578), so I'm going to rebuild it on sjlj-win32 and see what made it bad.\n",
