    "body": "@alexcrichton: There's already a condition variable on native channels as far as I know, so the natural way to expose this functionality is a `pthread_cond_timedwait` call (or a call to the Vista and later win32 equivalent). The M:N form can do whatever it does now for channels internally, and can be made more efficient later.\n\nExposing the natural, high-level API makes a lot more sense to me than exposing the lowest common denominator between native and green tasks as they are implemented at the moment. It won't require much implementation work to expose something else, if you don't try to make it faster for green threads than the current timer API.\n",
