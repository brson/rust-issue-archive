    "body": "It might be sensible to implement Drop on either Result, IoError or a variant of Result that calls fail! in the error case, and a language change so that destructuring it is possible and skips dropping.\n\nThis way, errors would continue to be fatal by default.\n\nRegarding ByteIterator, why not just store the result of the last operation (i.e. the one that returned EOF or another error) and adding a \"finish\" method that would take the ByteIterator by value and get the contained IoError?\n\nMaybe one could even extend foreach so that the value of the foreach statement is the return value of the finish method (provided the iterator implements the appropriate trait), but not sure about this.\n",
