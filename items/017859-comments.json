In light of recent discussions about the \"default mode\" (see the issues @thestinger linked too), we're thinking that release mode should likely be the default instead of debug mode.\n\nUntil we have those flags implemented, could we hold off on the `-C codegen-units=4` options for stage1/stage2? Otherwise I think all other changes here are unambiguously improvements!\n",
