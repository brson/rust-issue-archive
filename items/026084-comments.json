The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "There's no great way to test these span bugs, which is why they keep cropping up. You can do something specific if you can find an error which gives the whole field as the span in the error message then you can write a test like:\n\n```\nstruct Foo {\n    pub\n    foo: T,\n}\n```\n\nAnd test that you get the error on the line with `pub` (to be thorough, you need to have this kind of test for each part of the span you're testing). I don't recall the details of how the error checking works though, you might need to experiment.\n\nAnyway, usually we just don't bother ( :-( )\n",
