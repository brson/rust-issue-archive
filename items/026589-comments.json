    "body": "I introduced this bug in #17259 by tracking captures as they were resolved.\nAt the time I was unaware of secondary resolution requests in non-error paths.\nThe only one that I've seen since is for a little-known lint (because it's disabled by default, and only ever used in a test which tests that the lint works):\n\n``` rust\n#![warn(unused_qualifications)]\nmod foo {\n    pub fn bar() {}\n}\nuse foo::bar;\n\nfn main() {\n    foo::bar(); // warning: unnecessary qualification\n}\n```\n\nThis lint works by resolving the last element of a path after resolving the full path.\nIf the results match, the lint is triggered. However, in this case, there is a side-effect of upvar capture because that last element happens to match a local variable outside a closure scope.\n",
