  "body": "I added a new lint for variables whose names contain uppercase characters, since, by convention, variable names should be all lowercase. What motivated me to work on this was when I ran into something like the following:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::io::File;\nuse std::io::IoError;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut f = File::open(&Path::new(\"/something.txt\"));\n    let mut buff = [0u8, ..16];\n    match f.read(buff) {\n        Ok(cnt) => println!(\"read this many bytes: {}\", cnt),\n        Err(IoError{ kind: EndOfFile, .. }) => println!(\"Got end of file: {}\", EndOfFile.to_str()),\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI then got compile errors when I tried to add a wildcard match pattern at the end which I found very confusing since I believed that the 2nd match arm was only matching the EndOfFile condition. The problem is that I hadn't imported io::EndOfFile into the local scope. So, I thought that I was using EndOfFile as a sub-pattern, however, what I was actually doing was creating a new local variable named EndOfFile. This lint makes this error easier to spot by providing a warning that the variable name EndOfFile contains a uppercase characters which provides a nice hint as to why the code isn't doing what is intended.\n\nThe lint warns on local bindings as well:\n\n``` rust\nlet Hi = 0;\n```\n\nAnd also struct fields:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Something {\n    X: uint\n}\n```\n",
