    "body": "So, I have figured out what happened here (mostly) and it's pretty hilarious. For those who care here's the story...\n\nThe key fact here is that there a few calls to `begin_unwind`, and all of these that the string `explicit panic`. Usually LLVM recognizes this and specializes `begin_unwind` to have that value inline instead of getting it as an argument.\n\nThis means that the call to `begin_unwind` is very cheap, only the line number needs to be loaded into a register. This means that the common code for the calls to `begin_unwind` are just 2 instructions (a move and a call).\n\nNow, for some reason the added `inline` attribute tickles LLVM in a bad way and it stops to eliminate the function argument. I don't have an explanation for this(, yet?). Anyway, because the argument is still there, the calls to `begin_unwind` end up being more expensive (3 moves and a call).\n\nNow, the calls to `begin_unwind` don't return. So they are block tails. And because the calls are more expensive now, tail merging now kicks in. And tail merging simply can't preserve the debuginfo, so the test has to fail.\n\nTook me quite a while to figure that out. Fun fact: I basically had this figured out before, because tail merging was also the reason why I had to remove a case from that test when I turned fat pointers into immediate function arguments.\n\nAnyway, I'm going to file a PR that adds `-Cllvm-args=-enable-tail-merge=0` for this testcase, that should make it less error prone.\n",
