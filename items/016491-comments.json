    "body": "@kballard I believe our planned fix is outlined on the updated description on #8142.  (Note that it e.g. requires the ability to put bounds on type parameters in structs themselves, so that instead of having type-specialized `Drop` impls, you instead embed the desired constraints in the struct definition itself.)\n\nPerhaps instead of closing that ticket after the addition of #14988, we instead should have just taken it off the P-backcompat-lang list and 1.0 milestone, but still left it open.  I will go address that there.\n",
