    "body": "I'm actually super in-favor of naming schemes like this. In my opinion this is one of the things which I believe go did really well. It's different for them in that it's impossible to import a name into a package, you can only import package names into packages. That way in go when referencing types it's `package.Type` which if you're making an iterator name like `iterator.Iterator`, it seems a bit redundant.\n\nI'm personally in favor of this change, but rust is different in that it is possible to import `iterator::Map` into the current namespace. I also think that this isn't necessarily the best style because the whole point of short names is that the package name + the short name is what makes sense, not just the type name.\n\nFor this patch in particular, I would be in favor of removing any `use iterator::{XXX, XXX, XXX}` imports and changing them to `use iterator;` and then referencing all types through the `iterator` module. That way everything is still clear what it's actually intending (`iterator::Map` is far less ambiguous than `Map`).\n\nI'm hesitant to r+ this though because those are my own opinions and there's probably contention over this, so what are others' thoughts?\n",
