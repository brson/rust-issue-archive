    "body": "Those source links are a bit glaring. I prefer the style seen by [src] links in the existing rustdoc (though I definitely approve of putting them on every item). You might also consider only showing them on hover, just to keep the visual clutter down.\n\nI also think the stability annotations need some tweaking. I would suggest putting a little more space to the left, and perhaps ditching the underline in favor of e.g. [deprecated]. Also possibly drop the font size by a point or two.\n",

    "body": "I agree that the current layout is not that good (and that in general I suck at design ;), but it should be handled separately (there are lots of other issues in the rustdoc layout, I've noted some of them in #13804). My original intention is as follows:\n- For the source links, I wanted to make it look like a button. We don't have a consistent design for links attached to the heading (unlike Haddock, say) so I've made an arbitrary design choice.\n- For the stability indices, I wanted to make it look like a tag, and unlike the code. Personally I think that brackets without a further decoration can look like a code (especially for beginners).\n",
