    "body": "That would be a nice feature, but since unsized types and trait objects are both twice as large as a normal pointer it can't work that way. Both x86 and x64 have atomic instructions that are wide enough to operate on 64 and 128 bits respectively, but as far as I'm aware ARM does not have that. In general I think the widest atomic instructions on most platforms tend to be 1 pointer wide.\n\nEdit: try putting any slice in an AtomicPtr, you will see that it also doesn't work.\n",
