    "body": "This is great! I've certainly been wonting for this for awhile.\n\n@bstrie, I believe that there's nothing unsound about this because the function has ownership of `self` or `~self`, so it gets to decide the mutability of the contents. @luqmana is right in that there are lots of locations you'll find `let mut this = self` to work around not being able to bind `self` as mutable in the function declaration.\n\nI'd also be interested in a test or two with a mutable self in a default trait method. I know that there were bugs in the past for that, and I doubt that there's actually any bugs here, but better safe than sorry!\n",
