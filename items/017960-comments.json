    "body": "If we want the `zip` version to compile to a `memcpy` or a `memmove`, then first LLVM would have to compile this function into an lib call:\n\n``` c\nvoid f(int *a1, int *a2, size_t len1, size_t len2) {\n    for (size_t i = 0, j = 0; i < len1 && j < len2; ++i, ++j) {\n        a1[i] = a2[j];\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt is able to vectorize it, albeit with an aliasing check for the two arrays outside of the vectorized loop. It seems like it really should be able to realize that it can call `memmove`. It doesn't do any better with one induction variable, which at least says that induction variable analysis is working:\n\n``` c\nvoid g(int *a1, int *a2, size_t len1, size_t len2) {\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < len1 && i < len2; ++i) {\n        a1[i] = a2[i];\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf I add `restrict` to this, then it actually generates a call to `memcpy`:\n\n``` c\nvoid f(int * restrict a1, int * restrict a2, size_t len1, size_t len2) {\n    for (size_t i = 0, j = 0; i < len1 && j < len2; ++i, ++j) {\n        a1[i] = a2[j];\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTurning the `zip` code into something like that shouldn't be a problem, but I believe there is still an extra null check for None that isn't being eliminated. I know how to add it to the null check elimination pass, just haven't gotten around to it.\n\nIf we can get the Rust IR to look like the IR from the C code, then we have two options for getting a lib call out of it:\n1. Teach LLVM to be able to generate a `memmove` instead of just a `memcpy`. It seems that this should be possible and would benefit a lot of people using C/C++ code. On many platforms `memmove` and `memcpy` are aliases anyways.\n2. Use the new scoped aliasing metadata to express that the output can't alias the input here. This is more difficult, and the scoping of the aliasing regions doesn't match our impending switch to single-entry / multiple-exit regions, although it could hopefully be modified to do so.\n",

There is no memory dependency between them so it doesn't matter.\n\n> The NoAlias response may be used when there is never an immediate dependence between any memory reference based on one pointer and any memory reference based the other. The most obvious example is when the two pointers point to non-overlapping memory ranges. Another is when the two pointers are only ever used for reading memory. Another is when the memory is freed and reallocated between accesses through one pointer and accesses through the other \u2014 in this case, there is a dependence, but it\u2019s mediated by the free and reallocation.\n",
