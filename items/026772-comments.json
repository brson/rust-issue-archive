The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @aturon (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

We'll also always want a way to be able to unconditionally pass arguments down (e.g. platform-specific extensions), so whatever you can do today you should be able to do eventually when opting in to the flags.\n\nI agree it'd be nice to have a meaning for all combinations on all platforms, but I also think it's fine to not block this PR on that. Can you be sure to add a specific test case for all the cases mentioned here? \n",

    "body": "OK, we talked about this in triage the other day, and we didn't reach a concrete conclusion just yet but our thoughts were:\n- This seems like a good idea for a \"high level\" abstraction like `OpenOptions`. Lower level primitives probably don't want to deal with these kinds of differences but it seems safe to say that `OpenOptions` isn't that low-level.\n- We need to be careful about how cases like `.append(true).write(false)` are handled if certain options imply other options. \n- We'll probably always want to allow the ability to override these implications and defaults and go straight down to the system arguments. This sort of extension trait already exists for Windows (but is unstable) and may be useful for Unix as well. There are various corner cases (as discovered by @sfackler in #27217) which normally don't make sense but do make sense in some weird situations.\n\nOverall this probably also just needs an extra careful audit to make sure that basically every case is handled (and thanks for the table @pitdicker it's a great start). The libs team thinks this is ok to merge but may want some more thorough review before doing so.\n",
