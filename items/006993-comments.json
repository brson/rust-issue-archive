    "body": "More details on the \"right way\" to fix this.\n\nresolve.rs, generally speaking, builds tables and then resolves identifiers by looking things up in them.  Sometimes, this lookup should respect renamings (e.g. lexical bindings). Other times, it shouldn't (e.g., module names). \n\nduring expansion, identifiers gain \"syntax contexts\"; at the end of expansion, each ident has a uint telling what name it started with, and what syntax context it occurred in.  There's an operation called mtwt_resolve (that is, the \"resolve\" operation specified in the MTWT paper) that maps this to a new name.\n\nIdeally, then, this mtwt_resolve would be called when building the tables of lexical bindings, and not called otherwise. This would probably be done by having most of the tables just map Names (that is, uint indexes into the interner) to whatever-it-is-they-map-to.\n\nCurrently, however, these tables all map _idents_ to whatever-it-is.  I should fix this, but frankly, I'm  just scrambling to get through, so I'm taking the short-cut of using the existing data structure rather than updating them.\n",

    "body": "I'm working on this.\nSo far I see two subtasks to work on:\n- There's a bunch of random code everywhere using `Idents` unconsciously, it can be rewritten to work with `Names` unconditionally and without much doubt.\n- Some parts of resolve (all code calling `mtwt::resolve`) legitimately need `SyntaxContext` information from `Idents` to resolve hygienic names. So, HIR has to keep at least _some_ information about macro expansion despite the general desire to get rid of it. The good news is that many structures in HIR (at least `TraitRef`, `Generics`, `TyPath`, `PatStruct`, `ExprStruct`, `PatEnum`, `PatQPath`, but _not_ `ExprPath`) can drop syntax context information at cost of splitting `hir::Path` into `hir::NamePath` and `hir::IdentPath` (with `Name` and `Ident` segments respectively) and some duplication in resolve in code performing path resolution. This duplication can be considered a drawback, so this subtask is not as unambiguous as the previous one. I'd be glad to hear some opinions on this matter.\n\nI'll likely submit two separate PRs to cover these two tasks in order.\n",
