Best bet I think is to build everything redundantly in the old-and-new locations for a bit first, then snapshot and switch over to only using the new locations, then snapshot again and start purging the old locations.\n",

    "body": "I think this is finally working now. Here's the current scheme:\n- For each used crate we rpath the relative path from $ORIGIN to the location of the crate. This allows binaries to be relocated.\n- For each used crate we rpath the absolute path to the used crate. Our build relies upon this since currently the relative path to some libraries changes when they are promoted from the target directories to the host directories.\n- We also add an absolute fallback path to appropriate target lib directories under the install prefix.\n",
