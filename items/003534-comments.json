Using enums for newtypes makes less sense now that they aren't the only nominal types and the implementation has always been wonkey, with any single-variant enum being surprisingly dereffable.\n\nI do think that newtyping will become more important with impl coherence (e.g. if the creator of the type forgot to implement Hash), but we can probably do it better.\n",

Although I wouldn't mind this, I have a feeling it is not going to be popular, so perhaps it's best to just remove `enum Foo = T` but otherwise leave things as they are.\n",
