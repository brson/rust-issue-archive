    "body": "I've seen this definitely assist in `#[derive]` implementations in the past (as you don't have to insert the extra bounds manually). My only (very minor) concern would be about error messages. Previously `channel::<Rc<T>>` would provide a nice error message on construction, but I presume it yields basically the same error message when it crosses threads? It's a little unfortunate to get the error much later, but I also prefer this as it's strictly more flexibly (especially with generics as you say).\n\nr+ from me, but would like a second opinion from @brson or @aturon as well.\n",

In a case where you're generic enough to not be able to send an `Arc` value, you are therefore unable to make use of `Arc` beyond what `Rc` offers. In other words, the only reason to choose `Arc` is if you do want to communicate between threads, and you can only do that if you have sufficient type constraints anyway.\n\nFinally, as you point out, keeping the bounds tighter is the more conservative option.\n",
