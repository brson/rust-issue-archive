    "body": "Thanks, @alexcrichton and @jdm \n\nThis test failure seems to be caused by some oddity in LLVM's 32bit code generator. The IR looks the same for 32 and 64 bit but in 32bit mode the DWARF data does not contain an entry for the `unique_pointer` test function. Adding something useless to the function like `let _ = 0;` makes the problem go away. I guess this is some kind of optimization removing the function from machine code altogether... I'll have to look into it.\n",
