    "body": "I'm trying to build rust with 64bit MSYS2 on Windows10 with the steps described in README.MD  (installing a separate MinGW GCC 4.9 based toolchain). However MinGW cannot be installed right now, since the installer fails to download repositories.txt (this bug reappers from time to time, the last instance is here: https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/bugs/528/)\n\nIs there any way to get around it? Maybe using the mingw-get utility which works? Which packages should i choose in mingw-get to get the same environment? Or what about using Cygwin which is known to have a more stable installer? I'm using it's derivate called Babun daily in my work and I'm really satisfied with it.\n\n(Just as a side note, I've tried downloading compiler suites from http://www.drangon.org/mingw/ but I'm getting various errors with that way too, and I'm not so experienced with GNU toolset compiling to know exactly if it's not my error. Also i like to stay with the GNU way since i would like to build rust in the end with `--target=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi` using the Linaro ARM Windos toolchain in place).\n",
