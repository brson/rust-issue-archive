    "body": "This is a little tricky because all macros are lost after crate expansion. This would probably involve leaving behind sentinel values which are ignored for the rest of compilation, but remain to have the documentation.\n\nThere's also the matter of what the documentation should show, and it should probably show the patterns for which the macro is defined (not just the name of the macro), and this is a bit tricky as well. Just things to consider though, don't mean to stop any progress on this!\n\nIt would be awesome to have `std::macros` define all the macros defined by the compiler so they could actually all be documented in one place!\n",
