    "body": "I have a strong suspicion this won't cause any significant actual breakage. In fact, I suspect this change will _unbreak_ more code than it breaks (code that was assuming that `T` pointers are guaranteed to have `align_of::<T>()` alignment, which is far more true after this patch).\n\nI looked through [all the search results for \"mem align_of\"](https://github.com/search?l=rust&q=mem+align_of&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93) and didn't see anything where this would cause breakage. Essentially all uses of `align_of::<T>()` are fed into `allocate`/`reallocate`/`deallocate` calls, and these are all fine as long as (a) the alignment is valid for type `T` (which is true), and (b) each of those functions gets called with the same alignment value (also true).\n\n(I did notice some places in the search results which fall prey to making invalid assumptions about `align_of`... including in my own code. whoops.)\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, I just realised this change still doesn't _guarantee_ that every `&T` pointer will be aligned to `align_of::<T>()`, due to packed fields, e.g. this prints `1`, but \"should\" print 0:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::mem;\n\n#[repr(packed)]\nstruct Foo {\n    _x: u8,\n    y: u32,\n}\nfn main() {\n    let x = Foo { _x: 0, y: 0 };\n\n    println!(\"{}\", &x.y as *const _ as usize % mem::align_of::<u32>())\n}\n```\n\nHowever, I think this is still an improvement: the example in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21611 seems like a footgun (there's nothing special about the struct in that example). \n\n> We use the preferred alignment as the default alignment for a type. This appears to be what clang migrated towards as well\n\nIt seems we're currently using a different definition of preferred, e.g. [clang's behaviour](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21611#issuecomment-73232382) is what I'd expect Rust to do.\n",
