    "body": "Hmm, my patch is not as effective as I had hoped.\n\nMy current hypothesis is that this is because our build process is including absolute paths in the preprocessor output (i.e. becauase the `-Idir` directives are using absolute paths for the `dir`s), and by default `ccache` will treat such files as different keys in its cache.\n\nOne way to fix this would be to make use of the `CCACHE_BASEDIR` environment variable.  Another could be to use relative paths instead of absolute ones at appropriate steps in the build...\n",
