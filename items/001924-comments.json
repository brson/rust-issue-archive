It's obviously a big problem for valgrind, just based on the way valgrind works - callgrind shows it as taking up 50% of the running time on some benchmarks. In real multithreaded scenarios it is probably not nearly as bad. Still, it should be fixed just to reduce the cycle time on the linux bots.\n",
