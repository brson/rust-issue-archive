    "body": "I don't know how feasible it would be to implement, but an example usage could be:\n\n```\n#[repr(union)]\npub struct XEvent {\n  pub type_: c_int,\n  pub xany: XAnyEvent,\n  // ...\n  pub pad: [c_long; 24],\n}\n```\n\nLike C unions, each field would start at the beginning of the struct, and the size of the struct would be that of its longest field. This wouldn't require adding `union` as a language keyword. The only limitation I can think of would be that accessing a field in the union would require `unsafe`, which is already used often when interfacing with C libraries.\n\nA macro based solution could look something like:\n\n```\nunion! {\n  pub union XEvent {\n    pub type_: c_int,\n    pub xany: XAnyEvent,\n    // ...\n    pub pad: [c_long; 24],\n  }\n}\n\n// functions generated by macro:\nimpl XEvent {\n  pub unsafe fn type_<'a> (&'a self) -> &'a c_int { ::std::mem::transmute(self) }\n  pub unsafe fn type__mut<'a> (&'a mut self) -> &'a mut c_int { ::std::mem::transmute(self) }\n  pub unsafe fn xany<'a> (&'a self) -> &'a XAnyEvent { ::std::mem::transmute(self) }\n  pub unsafe fn xany_mut<'a> (&'a mut self) -> &'a mut XAnyEvent { ::std::mem::transmute(self) }\n  // ...\n  pub unsafe fn pad<'a> (&'a self) -> &'a [c_long; 24] { ::std::mem::transmute(self) }\n  pub unsafe fn pad_mut<'a> (&'a mut self) -> &'a mut [c_long; 24] { ::std::mem::transmute(self) }\n}\n```\n\nThe only thing that prevented me from writing this macro is the inability to determine the size of the union at compile time. The best workaround I could come up with is providing a guess of the size of the largest field and making the union generate tests to verify this.\n\n```\nunion! {\n  pub union XEvent : [c_long; 24] {\n    pub type_: c_int,\n    pub xany: XAnyEvent,\n    // ...\n    pub pad: [c_long; 24],\n  }\n}\n\n// test generated by macro:\n#[test]\nfn test_union_size_XEvent () {\n  use std::cmp::max;\n  use std::mem::size_of;\n  let sizes = [\n    size_of::<c_int>(),\n    size_of::<XAnyEvent>(),\n    // ...\n    size_of::<[c_long; 24]>(),\n  ];\n  assert!(sizes.iter().fold(0, |a, b| max(a, *b)) == size_of::<[c_long; 24]>());\n}\n```\n\nOf course, it would be much easier on developers of language bindings to have unions available as a language feature.\n",

    "body": "Most unions in C have a descriptor field, therefore there's a need for 2 cases (has-desciptor & has-no-descriptor). Being able to specify a struct-unique enum with custom type descriptor & the fields corresponding values would allow Rust to use the union in a type safe manner while being able to interoperate with C APIs\n\nEssentially something like\n\n```\n#[enum_explicit_descriptor(t)]\n#[enum_explicit_values = \"I: 0, N: 1\"]\nunsafe struct TValue{\n  t: u8,\n  val: unsafe enum IntOrFloat{\n    I(i32),\n    N(f32),\n  },\n}\n```\n\nUsing unsafe struct to handle cases where the type descriptor isn't adjacent to the union. Even then, something could be done like\n\n```\n#[enum_explicit_descriptor_type(u8)]\n#[enum_explicit_descriptor_typeoffset(-1)] // This could be behind-the-struct by default\n#[enum_explicit_values = \"I: 0, N: 1\"]\nenum IntOrFloat{\n  I(i32),\n  N(f32),\n}\n```\n\nThen there'd need to be compile-time machinery that makes sure there's a valid u8 behind the enum in definitions, though user code would access a `struct TValue{ t:u8, val: IntOrFloat }`\n\nThe issue of having typeoffset could be resolved by requiring explicit enums only be contained in structs & have enum_explicit_layout_typeoffset be specified by the struct. Would require a bit more strictness though since one wouldn't be able to know how to find the descriptor of an &IntOrFloat parameter\n",

    "body": "@serprex: I don't think it's worthwhile to add language support for external descriptors of unions, even in cases where there is a 1:1 match between a single descriptor field value and a union variant. The code using unions is expected to be close to FFI, where unsafe is the norm; so variant matching can be always unsafe, and the burden of ensuring the correct variant would be completely on the programmer, as it is in C.\n",
