    "body": "I looked into it, but the new `rt::io::extensions::WriterUtil` doesn't seem to have a `write_str` method, nor does it appear to be possible to get a writer which to a string (which `io::with_str_writer` currently does).  Which means I'd essentially have to write at least `with_str_writer`.\n\nIt looks like including something like `write_str` was discussed in #8089 but then left alone as undecided on whether to include it.  I haven't seen anything regarding `with_str_writer`.\n\nSo I guess I need input on whether I should: A) wait for more additions to `rt::io` supporting strings, or B) write an equivalent to `with_str_writer` and include it in either `json` or somewhere in `rt::io`, then find some way to convert strings into a writable format.\n\nOf course if I'm missing something in `rt::io` which supports strings, let me know.  `std::rt` isn't included in the docs, unfortunately.\n",

    "body": "It's true that there aren't as many \"nice methods\", but I think that it's partially by design that way. You can get `write_str` with `write(str.as_bytes())`, and `with_str_writer` can be done with `MemWriter` and `str::from_owned_bytes`.\n\nYou can look at the example in the `sprintf` function inside of `std/fmt/mod.rs` of how to go from a byte-writer to a string. Ideally there'd be a helper function for doing so in `rt::io`, but we haven't fully finished moving towards that just yet.\n",

    "body": "So I dove into this today, got a fair bit done, then ran into #8579 and #6551.  Using &-ptrs in the Encoder and Decoder forces lifetime constraints where they're used, and in extra::workcache providing those constraints causes ICEs.  Those ICEs, in this case, can't be worked around without having unconstrained type errors.\n\nCurrent status is on this branch: https://github.com/singingboyo/rust/tree/json-to-rt-io if anyone wants to take a look, but it seems to me like rt::io support isn't going to work at the moment unless we want to be using @-ptrs.\n",
