    "body": "I believe this is a dupe of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/16205, which was fixed very recently by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/16458 (just after the nightly compiler you are using); the compiler now correctly emits an error message, http://is.gd/dtQa8z\n\n```\n<anon>:6:9: 6:11 error: cannot move out of dereference of `&`-pointer\n<anon>:6     for &x in vector.iter() {\n                 ^~\n<anon>:6:10: 6:11 note: attempting to move value to here (to prevent the move, use `ref x` or `ref mut x` to capture value by reference)\n<anon>:6     for &x in vector.iter() {\n                  ^\n```\n\nThanks for filing!\n",
