  "body": "Right now the --crate-id and related flags are all process _after_ the entire\ncrate is parsed. This is less than desirable when used with makefiles because it\nmeans that just to learn the output name of the crate you have to parse the\nentire crate (unnecessary).\n\nThis commit changes the behavior to lift the handling of these flags much sooner\nin the compilation process. This allows us to not have to parse the entire crate\nand only have to worry about parsing the crate attributes themselves. The\nrelated methods have all been updated to take an array of attributes rather than\na crate.\n\nAdditionally, this ceases duplication of the \"what output are we producing\"\nlogic in order to correctly handle things in the case of --test.\n\nFinally, this adds tests for all of this functionality to ensure that it does\nnot regress.\n",
