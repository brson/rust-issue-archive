I don't actually know if that's the order we do things in, but I also can't quite tell if this patch preserves that structure. (Niko wants to change it, but that's a different matter)\n- I am not sure spans are ... entirely robust, in terms of being unique and reliable identifiers-of-code. We generate artificial ones in some contexts and there is a fair amount of subtlety concerning spans originating in macros to consider. I'm not sure if this change is safe in that sense.\n\nI'm of course glad to see attention on the lint system! Maybe I am just being my usual paranoid self and these concerns are not so serious? Happy to entertain some discussion on the matter. I just see this sitting here and I'm not r+'ing it due to a little hesitation.\n",

I had the thought of doing an inverse style:\n- lint would be the only to report lintable errors, but it would not do any error detection itself\n- earlier passes would find lintable errors and add them into tables that would be read by lint\n- (perhaps even just a single master table that maps from `node_id -> ~[LintableError]` or something)\n  - this seems like it addresses the most annoying part of the refactoring required, which is that you currently must know the item id as well as the id where the error occurs etc. There will still be some work for those parts of the code that only pass spans around, but it's probably better to work more on ids anyhow\n",

I wanted to do what @nikomatsakis was thinking, but I couldn't figure out a reliable way of always checking every `node_id`, although that approach is definitely a lot more robust than using spans.\n\nIs there a way to iterate over every node id in the ast, or would I need to add something like `visit_node_id` to visit.rs? That was the main trouble I ran into when figuring what the minimum amount of reliable information that various passes like liveness could pass into lint for later warning.\n",
