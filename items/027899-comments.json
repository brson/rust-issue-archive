    "body": "The fact that you can't _declare_ new items with keywords is certainly intended.\n`$self: ident` is prohibited for the same reason why `let self = 10;` or `struct self { field: u8 }` are prohibited.\n_Referencing_ existing entities with keywords is possible in some cases - keywords `super`, `self` and `Self` can be used as segments in paths (including paths with one segment).\n\n`ident` nonterminal accepting `self` is strange, because `self` can't be used everywhere where identifiers can be used.\nHowever, `ident` [seems to accept](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6fa61b810dc95ca3e8bbda1681229f855f214fc4/src/libsyntax/ext/tt/macro_parser.rs#L536) not only valid identifiers, but everything fitting into `token::Ident` - identifiers, keywords, reserved keywords - and errors (like the one from your example) are caught during macro expansion and not at macro use.\nThis seems to be a pretty reasonable approach, albeit surprising, and is probably intended.\n\nI suppose, `ident` can be backward compatibly restricted to reject keywords and reserved identifiers with exception of path segment keywords `super`, `self` and `Self` (because you may want to write things like `$seg: ident => $seg::foo::bar`), but I don't see much benefit from such restriction.\n\nBasically, I'd close this as Not-a-Bug, but need a confirmation from someone, cc @nrc \n",

    "body": "Agree with @petrochenkov. For all the macro token classifiers, I would treat `foo` as meaning 'vaguely foo like', otherwise we would end up with hundreds of classifiers and it would be awkward to write macros. This has some downsides in terms of catching errors a bit later than is optimal, but I think the trade-off is OK here.\n",
