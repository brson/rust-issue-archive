  "body": "librustc: Require lifetimes within the types of values with destructors to have strictly greater lifetime than the values themselves.\n\nAdditionally, remove `#[unsafe_destructor]` in favor of these new\nrestrictions.\n\nThis broke a fair amount of code that had to do with `RefCell`s. We will\nprobably need to do some work to improve the resulting ergonomics. Most\ncode that broke looked like:\n\n```\nmatch foo.bar.borrow().baz { ... }\nuse_foo(&mut foo);\n```\n\nChange this code to:\n\n```\n{\n    let bar = foo.bar.borrow();\n    match bar.baz { ... }\n}\nuse_foo(&mut foo);\n```\n\nThis fixes an important memory safety hole relating to destructors,\nrepresented by issue #8861.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nr? @nikomatsakis \n\nIf you want I can talk about the followups to improve ergonomics of RefCell that I want to do, but this is the BC change.\n",
