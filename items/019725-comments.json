    "body": "@alexcrichton: Doing what you suggest would require conditional elevation of privileges _after_ setup process had already been started (remember, we now do not require admin privileges at launch).\nI do not see an easy way to accomplish that in InnoSetup.   It may be possible through custom scripting, but I'd rather not invest much time into learning its custom scripting language, given that we'll replace InnoSetup with Windows Installer and [WiX Toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/), once @brson figures out the combined installer story (I assume we do want to do this?).  In WiX, this sort of thing is available out-of-the box.  \nMeanwhile, if adding installation directory to per-user path is not acceptable, I suggest we just revert to requiring admin privileges to install.\n",
