It would be great if we could avoid expanding them for now.\n\nNotably:\n- `std::collections::hash` is introduced, and is a duplicate of `std::hash`.\n- `String::format` was introduced, and is a duplicate of `std::fmt::format`\n\nAlso, as others have noted, this is just a band-aid, it's not really fixing the underlying issue. The bugs being \"fixed\" here aren't really bugs per se but rather all victims of lack of macro import/export, macro hygiene at the item level, etc. Code will still not work if you have `extern crate core` somewhere different than the root, or if you rename it to something else.\n\nI think we can land this for now (hopefully with no API extensions), but I'm very wary of continuing down this path which was not meant to be taken of shoehorning hygiene under the facade where it doesn't exist.\n",
