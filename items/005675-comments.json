    "body": "Hang on... it's not at all clear to me that this should be fixed by allowing duplicate definitions. What's the semantic model for redefinitions? Scoping works differently for items, and it seems like we dodge a lot of questions by disallowing redefinitions here. In fact, it's not clear that the OP was actually asking for duplicate definitions, but simply for a better/earlier error message. Can I nominate this for WONTFIX ? Maybe I officially nominate it for not-a-bug / well-defined.\n",

    "body": "I hoped we'd at least reject the duplicate definition right away rather than accepting it and then rejecting all further input, it doesn't seem very productive to brick the whole session but still accept input.\n\nI'd also say that redefinitions are really helpful for exploratory programming in the REPL. So even if this change isn't optimal yet (I haven't tried it), it's probably better than the current behavior?\n",
