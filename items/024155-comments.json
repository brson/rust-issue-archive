The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @kmcallister (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Ok, I got a chance to look at this briefly.  Three ideas (none of which is glorious):\n1. Add a mechanism to specify what hygiene space will be used in a particular expansion (this could cause fallout at a large number of call sites).  And apply the same hygiene space to items in a multi-statement macro.\n2. Add a dummy AST node that represents a bundle of items, similar to a lexical scope, except that all names in the root of the bundle would escape into the parent scope.  Then wrap/unwrap as statement macros are expanded.\n3. Post-process after expanding each multi-statement macro to put all the expanded symbols into the same hygiene space.  (It may be impossible to reliably determine what constitutes a root symbol after full expansion has taken place.)\n\nI am hoping that there are better ideas out there.\n",
