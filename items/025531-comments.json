    "body": "Must we really have feature flags for everything? If the bug turns out to have an easy fix, surely just fixing the bug would be preferable to introducing _yet another_ feature flag. Let's wait for a day so the bug can get discussed, and if it turns out to be a very hard problem the feature flag can always be introduced then. Alternatively, temporarily change the line\n\n``` rust\nimpl<T: ?Sized+Unsize<U>, U: ?Sized> CoerceUnsized<Rc<U>> for Rc<T> {}\n```\n\nto\n\n``` rust\nimpl<T: ?Sized+Copy+Unsize<U>, U: ?Sized> CoerceUnsized<Rc<U>> for Rc<T> {}\n```\n\nbecause the `Copy` bound will prevent types with a `Drop` implementation from being coerced for now (why don't we have a `Pod` trait anymore?), and removing the bound is probably backwards compatible. \n",
