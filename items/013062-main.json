  "body": "This is a very minor edit to the tutorial section on references.\n\nReading this section for the first time, I stumbled on the phrase \"a reference can be borrowed to any object.\"  Its meaning was clear enough once I got it, but I had to re-read it a couple of times to parse it correctly.  Something about the passive voice plus the way \"reference to any object\" is split up by the verb phrase.  How about this instead?\n",
