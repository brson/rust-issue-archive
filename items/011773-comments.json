    "body": "In general, I like the idea for this lint, but I'd like to garner some more opinions on this (I don't think we've quite reached a consensus on #10573 yet).\n\nImplementation-wise, I'm troubled to see how invasive it is to the other lint passes and the visiting context itself. I would expect this to be a pretty self contained lint which only checks function signatures, structs, and enums (checks in visit_item and visit_fn). It looks like the invasive parts elsewhere are mainly to get a better error message, which I think is ok to sacrifice for complexity reduction, but I may have also missed a point where they're more crucial to the analysis.\n",

I guess I can try it.\n\nRe #10573: I've implemented this because I think it's very bad code style to have private types in public code signatures (e.g. users of your library can no longer name the type that functions return; e.g. you can't write wrappers around them, you can only use call the functions directly) and so I'd like to have the option for the compiler to warn about it whether or not we decide to outright disallow it.\n",
