Do you have a particular set of functions in mind?\n\nHere is where things get somewhat complicated, I'm afraid...\n\nThe recommended approach is to use libcap or libcap-ng but that means taking on a dependency on a library that doesn't always come with the base system.\n\nThe alternative approach is to make the capget and capset system calls directly.  Those system calls have gone through a number of iterations so you need to probe the kernel to figure out what is actually supported.  It's not super difficult but it involves a bit of special-casing.\n\nIt's probably worth mentioning that [the man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/capget.2.html) for the system calls is years out of date.  The current API is 0x20080522 and was added in 2.6.26.  It should be mostly compatible with 0x20071026, IIRC it was added to work around ABI breakage with 32 bits programs on 64 bits kernels.\n\nAbout capability dropping itself, I would suggest making it opt-in or maybe opt-out but not mandatory.  Sometimes you want the child process to inherit some or all of your capabilities.\n",
