    "body": "Thanks! I tried using `Pipe` as the name of the generic struct that is now named `PipeImpl`, but then client calls like\n\n```\nPipe::open(libc::STDERR_FILENO)\n```\n\nhave to be\n\n```\nPipe::<Readable>::open(libc::STDERR_FILENO)\n```\n\nwhich means `Readable` and `Writable` have to be `pub`, in addition to being more verbose. It could be\n\n```\nPipeReader::open(libc::STDERR_FILENO)\n```\n\nbut for issue #11047.\n\nThere are a few other ways we could avoid that empty struct.\n\nFirst, we could make it a module, but then rustc warns, \"module `Pipe` should have a snake case name such as `pipe`\".\n\nSecond, we could promote the functions to the top level of the module (possibly renaming them to disambiguate them from other `open`s and `from_filedesc`s). This doesn't seem like it's the pattern in libstd now, though.\n\nThird, `open` and `from_filedesc` could become methods of `PipePair`, modulo some renaming, like `open` becoming `open_end`, `open_side`, or `open_half`.\n\nThoughts?\n",

    "body": "@jbapple thanks for taking a look at these apis! They're definitely sorely in need of a redesign.\n\nThe API proposed here leaves me with many questions, and we may want to hold off this work to get a more holistic view of the entire `std::io` module and see what role this module plays in the grander scheme of things. Some of the questions that came to mind were:\n1. The name `PipeImpl` is pretty nonstandard, we don't have many other instances of `FooImpl` in the standard library.\n2. The usage of phantom types is also pretty rare, which while clever, we need to consider.\n3. The reliance on this type-level distinction for I/O objects being readable or writable is pretty rare, and we would want to be sure to apply this design _everywhere_ instead of just to this one module.\n4. The questions you brought up about `Pipe::open` are somewhat worrying.\n5. The blank struct `Pipe` just for a namespace is worrying.\n6. The exposure of `FileDesc` is worrying as I don't believe it's a public type that can be constructed.\n\nWould you be ok holding off this work for now? The `std::io` module is the next major blocker to tackle during stabilization, and we'd like to be sure to spearhead a design for the entire module at once instead of having each individual module go in its own direction.\n",
