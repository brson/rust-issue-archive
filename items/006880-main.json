Slightly ham-fisted -- feel particularly funny about using the typeck phase to gather the base -> impl mapping, and the separate code paths for traits vs. \"real\" bases feels like it could be avoided -- but it seems to work.\n\nAs always, open to suggestions if there's a better way to accomplish what I'm trying to do.\n\n@catamorphism r?\n",
