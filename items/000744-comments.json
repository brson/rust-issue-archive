    "body": "I think we should take a different approach here, and resist more doing more filename munging in link_binary.\n\nIn rustc::driver::rustc::main there's already a big hunk of code dedicated to figuring out the correct name of the output file, and we have a function in std::os called dylib_filename that builds correct library names for the host platform. For now I think the best thing to do is put another check in main that uses dylib_filename when the compiler is building a library and isn't given an output file.\n\nUltimately all that filename manipulation in main should probably be separated from the call to compile_input and extracted to its own function.\n",
