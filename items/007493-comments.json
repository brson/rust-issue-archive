    "body": "Visiting for triage. Specifying `-O` twice works, specifying `-C opt-level` twice works. Mixing them does not. I think it should be fixed. This is easy to do. There is explicit code in `rustc::session::config` that turns this scenario into an error. Instead it should figure out which one appeared last in the argument list and choose it. May require a bit of a hack to make that happen, scanning `env::args` independently of the `getopts` processing. Add a test case to `src/run-make`.\n",
