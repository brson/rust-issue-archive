    "body": "Thanks for the bug report! Sadly rusti has been deemed that it no longer belongs in-tree and was removed as part of 7c92435f8f93344330e47fb0cca4f79297896bd2. Closing because rusti no longer exists.\n\nOn a side note, I would highly recommend using rust master right now. You'll find that _many_ issues are fixed even daily, and that it's easier to keep up with a few days of changes at a time rather than months.\n",
