    "body": "@thestinger @nikomatsakis's proposed definition (or my interpretation thereof) is fairly narrow. `T` can be `Freeze` iff the memory directly pointed at by `&T` cannot be changed. It is shallow and does not imply any logical immutability as the current definition might (although I am not entirely clear on the specifics of that). As such, the `Freeze` bound probably wouldn't be used in many places other than those that have already been enumerated.\n",

    "body": "What's a use case of `Freeze` then? After `Share` lands, the only use case I can think of is type-based alias analysis and it won't want this change of definition. The current definition isn't about a logical immutability - it's about shallow immutability.\n\nDeep immutability seems almost meaningless, as I/O and memory allocation break the invariant. The concept does not exist in GCC or LLVM. It doesn't seem useful for enforcing purity, because the methods would already need to be marked as pure or they might be performing I/O _without_ a handle from the object.\n",
