  "body": "Apparently windows doesn't like reading from stdin with a large buffer size, and\nit also apparently is ok with a smaller buffer size. This changes the reader\nreturned by stdin() to return an 8k buffered reader for stdin rather than a 64k\nbuffered reader.\n\nApparently libuv has run into this before, taking a peek at their code, with a\nspecific comment in their console code saying that \"ReadConsole can't handle big\nbuffers\", which I presume is related to invoking ReadFile as if it were a file\ndescriptor.\n\nCloses #13304\n",
