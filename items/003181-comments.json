We get that now with `let _x = e;` but a lot of times I don't want to think of a name for this variable, so I'd rather write `let _ = e`.\n",

    "body": "In general, @pcwalton wants destructors to run when a value is \"dead\" rather than explicitly at the end of scope.  The reason for this being primarily to deal with moves, which currently require a hokey extra field in structs to record whether the struct was moved or not---though I could imagine a hybrid version where destructors ran at the end of scope, _unless_ you move the value, in which case they would be destroyed as soon as you enter a path where the value is dead but will not be moved.  For example, if you had an `if` and you move the value in the `then` branch but not the `else`, then upon entering the `else` branch the value would be destructed.\n\nMy feeling however is that D probably does this better than C++.  Destruction in D, as I understand it, occurs sometime between the variable being dead and it going out of scope.  If you want to tie the destructor execution to the scope, you use a `scope` keyword rather than giving the variable a name.  This seems more reliable than C++, where it is common to do\n\n```\nAutoLock(theLock)\n```\n\nin place of\n\n```\nAutoLock lock(theLock)\n```\n\nthe former of course creates a temporary and is probably not what you intended.\n",
