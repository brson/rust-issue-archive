    "body": "OK, I think your latest failure is due to language changes, and the test can be updated. I think that the test case was xfailed because it was broken, due to #4396. I think that I fixed the reason that it was originally xfailed with previous default method work (although there still generics problems with supertraits that I am working on at the moment).\n\nDropping the `&mut`s and getting rid of the assignment in `SetX` makes the test pass. `issue-3979-xcrate.rs` has the same failure. `issue-3979.rs`, on the other hand, works fine, although it was xfailed with a comment saying it was because of \"ICE with explicit self\". That was added by @pcwalton while demuting the test suite, in 82062a63.\n",
