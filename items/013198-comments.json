    "body": "Seems like the culprit is wrapping the static value in a [pre tag if it has a line break](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustdoc/html/render.rs#L1136).\n\nRemoving wouldn't be a complete solution since for multi-line values it makes sense for a `pre` html tag to be used over `code` such as [here](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/term/terminfo/parser/compiled/index.html#statics) or [here](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/rustc/metadata/encoder/index.html#statics).\n\nAlthough in certain situations displaying the literal code in a `pre` tag isn't correct either because the [whitespace can get messed up](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/sync/atomics/index.html#statics) when the code declaration is indented. I think rustdoc should take into account the length of the declaration before the equals sign and trim it from subsequent lines if it is there.\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-16 at 8 41 47 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1638690/2727955/b2db51ae-c5e4-11e3-97fc-dcd5fb90f8e1.png)\n\nMaybe a simple fix for the above mentioned issue would be for rustdoc to strip out any newlines immediately following an operator (other than a comma)? That way we would remove ambiguity from a short declaration that wraps on a new line from an actual large declaration.\n",
