From what I understand, the benefits are:\n- It doesn't matter if the remote repositories change locations or go away.\n- No extra management is necessary on those just building Rust. You only need to touch the subtree if you're updating it or adding a new one.\n- No extra step is needed to check out the subtree\n\nThe downsides being\n- The subtree can be modified to be different than the upstream copy.\n- It looks like the subtree can be modified without worrying about the upstream copy.\n\nI feel that the benefit of not having to worry about the remote repository going away far outweighs the downsides, personally.\n\n---\n\n@retep998 \n\nI forgot about that.\n",
