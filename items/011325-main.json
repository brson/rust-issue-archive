  "body": "I created a benchmark recently of incrementing a global variable inside of a\n`extra::sync::Mutex`, and it turned out to be horribly slow. For 100K\nincrements (per thread), the timings I got were:\n\n```\n1 green thread: 10.73ms\n8 green threads: 10916.14ms\n1 native thread: 9.19ms\n8 native threads: 4610.18ms\n```\n\nUpon profiling the test, most of the time is spent in `kevent()` (I'm on OSX)\nand `write()`. I thought that this was because we were falling into epoll too\nmuch, but after implementing the scheduler only falling back to epoll() if there\nis no work or active I/O handles, it didn't fix the problem.\n\nThe problem actually turned out to be that the schedulers were in high\ncontention over the tasks being run. With RUST_TASKS=1, this test is blazingly\nfast (78ms), and with RUST_TASKS=2, its incredibly slow (3824ms). The reason\nthat I found for this is that the tasks being enqueued are constantly stolen by\nother schedulers, meaning that tasks are just getting ping-ponged back and forth\naround schedulers while the schedulers spend _a lot_ of time in `kevent` and\n`write` waking each other up.\n\nThis optimization only wakes up a sleeping scheduler on every 8th task that is\nenqueued. I have found this number to be the \"low sweet spot\" for maximizing\nperformance. The numbers after I made this change are:\n\n```\n1 green thread: 13.96ms\n8 green threads: 80.86ms\n1 native thread: 13.59ms\n8 native threads: 4239.25ms\n```\n\nWhich indicates that the 8-thread performance is up to the same level of\nRUST_TASKS=1, and the other numbers essentiallyt stayed the same.\n\nIn other words, this is a 136x improvement in highly contentious green programs.\n",
