  "body": "This is part of the overall strategy I would like to take when approaching\nissue #11165. The only two I/O objects that reasonably want to be \"split\" are\nthe network stream objects. Everything else can be \"split\" by just creating\nanother version.\n\nThe initial idea I had was the literally split the object into a reader and a\nwriter half, but that would just introduce lots of clutter with extra interfaces\nthat were a little unnnecssary, or it would return a ~Reader and a ~Writer which\nmeans you couldn't access things like the remote peer name or local socket name.\n\nThe solution I found to be nicer was to just clone the stream itself. The clone\nis just a clone of the handle, nothing fancy going on at the kernel level.\nConceptually I found this very easy to wrap my head around (everything else\nsupports clone()), and it solved the \"split\" problem at the same time.\n\nThe cloning support is pretty specific per platform/lib combination:\n- native/win32 - uses some specific WSA apis to clone the SOCKET handle\n- native/unix - uses dup() to get another file descriptor\n- green/all - This is where things get interesting. When we support full clones\n            of a handle, this implies that we're allowing simultaneous writes\n            and reads to happen. It turns out that libuv doesn't support two\n            simultaneous reads or writes of the same object. It does support\n            _one_ read and _one_ write at the same time, however. Some extra\n            infrastructure was added to just block concurrent writers/readers\n            until the previous read/write operation was completed.\n\nI've added tests to the tcp/unix modules to make sure that this functionality is\nsupported everywhere.\n",
