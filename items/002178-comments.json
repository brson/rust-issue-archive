    "body": "Ok. The code has never been optimized and should certainly be rewritten. To me that's separate from the language design question. Removing constraints altogether seems premature to me. As far as I know, they're not used not because they aren't useful (there are lots of places where they would be useful just in the compiler), but because people found the overhead of using them (as far as cognitive burden) to be too high. I'm not seeing the evidence that there isn't a more usable design that still lets us state more precise properties about code. It's not like we've tried to revise the design and failed to find something that works better -- there just haven't been enough person-hours available to do so. I think it's worth putting in some effort there before we raise the white flag completely. \n",

I think that's premature given the number of incomplete portions, lack of recent attention, number of plausibly-useful reduced-functionality DBC-like or contract-like forms it could assume, and the fact that we need at very least the init-predicate tracking for memory safety (hard to emulate any other way given the existence of move operators and whatnot).\n",
