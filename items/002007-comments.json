    "body": "I am tentatively in favor of this but there are two considerations, both related to the consistency problem:\n1. When we auto-generate comparison operators, we have to consider which impls to use for the nested operations.  So long as the user has to declare the generation of the operators, as you proposed, this is relatively simple: you use the impls that are in scope at the declaration.\n2. I think we need to resolve the hashtable problem first (that is, track the impl along with the value of a type parameter for bounded type parameters) or else we will certainly encounter problems.\n",
