    "body": "> I infer from this that new_type.0 unwrapping is happening in the runtime. This is going to be terrible for my VMs performance. It would seem that a major use case for newtypes would be wrapping raw numbers for math-heavy applications, so your Kilos don't mix with your Meters. \n\nThis isn't something to worry about at all: in Rust, there's no implicit layers of pointers/indirection insert, meaning `struct Foo(int)` and `int` have the same representation at runtime. Secondly, a field access is one of the cheapest things you can do with a struct, it's just a pointer offset (and for the first field of a struct, like `.0`, it's a no-op). Furthermore, this sort of simplistic data access is very easy for the compiler to optimise and the constant value will be inlined directly.\n",
