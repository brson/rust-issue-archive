    "body": "r+ if accessor is changed to be `is_binding` and not `!is_enum && !is_const`\n\nI am ... a little nervous about the definition of Eq with opt, in that it takes into account the actual value to which the constant is bound.  But it seems to be consistent with what is written in the check_alt code.  I can't decide if there are implications of that I'm not thinking of...but I think it's ok.\n",
