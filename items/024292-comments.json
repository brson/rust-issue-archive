Making `Leak` an OIBIT and opting out for `JoinGuard` seems sufficient to me; `Arc` already requires two trait bounds on its generic type parameter and I've never really seen anyone complain about it, so I suspect the annotation burden isn't too severe.\n",

Upon investigating, we actually have a few known sources of memory leaks today in the standard library and the compiler itself, all of which can lead to the same form of memory unsafety as exposed through `Rc`:\n- [Failing destructors will leak local variables](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14875) ([example unsafety](https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/ea7a38d32c4f84ea173d))\n- [`Vec` does not handle panicking destructors well](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/16135) ([example unsafety](https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/4f11bf049f9cc157d6fd)). Note that this may apply to other collections as well.\n\nEach of these can definitely be classified as a bug in its own right, but it goes to show that a targeted solution at `Rc`/`Arc` may not totally fit the bill as it's often pretty convenient to just assume it's ok that destructors do not run.\n",

    "body": "Yeah I'm a bit confused that std::thread::JoinGuard is getting the blame here. It seems to me that the real problem is that Rc+RefCell enables writing mem::forget in safe code:\n\n``` rust\nfn safe_forget<T>(data: T) {\n    use std::rc::Rc;\n    use std::cell::RefCell;\n\n    struct Leak<T> {\n        cycle: RefCell<Option<Rc<Rc<Leak<T>>>>>,\n        data: T,\n    }\n\n    let e = Rc::new(Leak {\n        cycle: RefCell::new(None),\n        data: data,\n    });\n    *e.cycle.borrow_mut() = Some(Rc::new(e.clone())); // Create a cycle\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    struct Foo<'a>(&'a mut i32);\n\n    impl<'a> Drop for Foo<'a> {\n        fn drop(&mut self) {\n            *self.0 += 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    let mut data = 0;\n\n    {\n        let foo = Foo(&mut data);\n        safe_forget(foo);\n    }\n\n    data += 1; // super make sure there's no outstanding borrows\n\n    println!(\"{:?}\", data); // prints 1, should print 2\n}\n\n```\n\nPlanned features like `Vec::drain_range` rely on the fact that the destructor of the iterator will be called before the parent `Vec` becomes accessible again for _memory safety_. (rough sketch: data in the middle of the Vec is moved out (becoming logically uninitialized) and elements are _only_ back-shifted in the iterator's destructor).\n",

I'm suggesting the same thing @Gankro is, that we _should_ prevent writing mem::forget in safe code, using Rc or otherwise.\n\nWould it work to somehow prevent an Rc from being put in an Rc, by requiring a particular type class for things put in Rc, and not providing that type class for Rc itself?  (That would then prevent building a cyclic data structure with Rc, which seems like a feature.  Such structures could still be built with arenas or similar.)\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton These are all probably resolvable with a `Leak` trait the compiler knows about... for example, we could forbid putting types with `!Leak` in locals within destructors (this would imply that we should use `?Leak` like `?Sized`, assuming `Leak` by default for type parameters on types with `Drop` impls, and that this was assumed by default for destructors, which I think is fine since `Leak` doesn't violate parametricity in ways that interfere with dropck).  This would also solve the `Vec` case, since `Vec` would simply not accept `Leak` types (in the future, with \"not\" specialization, we could then provide two versions of the `Vec` destructor, solving the issue without reducing efficiency for other types).\n\n**Edit**: Rereading the bug, this isn't really true.  I think we actually can't solve this generally without some form of `nothrow` (which I want anyway, but clearly isn't going to come to Rust before 1.0 :( ).  None of this would be an issue with abort on fail within a destructor...\n\n@joshtriplett There is no way to do this in general without disallowing interior mutability within `Rc` (expanding Rust's ability to determine type safety for reference cycles is desirable in its own right, of course).  The solution I'm in favor of is ensuring (via a trait `Leak`) that you could explicitly opt out of the ability to `mem::forget` a particular type, like `JoinGuard` (but there are many others for which this might be appropriate).\n",

However it shouldn't be possible to implement mem::forget in purely safe code.\n\nSo, rather than introducing traits to prevent putting JoinGuard in Rc, why not introduce traits to prevent putting Rc in Rc?  (And since in general a type like Rc that can have reference loops would necessarily involve unsafe in the middle, it's the responsibility of that type to say so and prevent nesting such types.)\n\nThen, even if you have interior mutability, you still couldn't create a reference loop without also using an unsafe cast.\n\nAs for the trait itself, has there been any work on negative lifetime bounds?  As in, \"this object has lifetime 'a, so it cannot be referenced from something that'll live longer than 'a, and thus any arena you stuff a pointer to it into cannot have an overall arena lifetime longer than 'a\".\n",

    "body": "> why not introduce traits to prevent putting Rc in Rc?\n\nBecause that would make it impossible to implement many useful data structures in safe rust code. I'd imagine such a change would horribly break pretty much any program with non-trivial Rc usage, and leave them with using `unsafe` all over the place as the only fix that doesn't involve re-writing the whole program.\n\nI think the proper solution is to admit that we won't be able to prevent memory leaks without massively reducing the expressiveness of safe rust, and thus make `mem::forget` a safe function to indicate that skipping destructor calls is always a possibility. (remember, there are currently also ways to implement `mem::forget` in safe rust without using `Rc`)\n\nI think Rust can do without RAII guards where skipping the destructor is memory-unsafe -- closures are a perfectly good alternative, and there aren't that many types affected.

    "body": "I'm not aware of a `forget` implementation not using `Rc` that works for non-`'static` using the standard libraries. (but similar smart pointer types in other libraries probably will have the same problem)\n\nBugs regardings panics are equivalent to requiring `'static` since you can't catch panics for non-`'static` data. (you could with the first version of `thread::scoped`, but that leads to unsafety in other ways)\n\nIt seems to me that the problem here involves 4 things happening at the same time:\n1. `Rc` containing another `Rc`\n2. `Rc` with interior mutability\n3. `Rc` contains non-`'static` data\n4. The non-`'static` data has a `Drop` impl\n\nWithout 1. or 2., you can't construct cycles (?). Without 3. or 4., leaks should be harmless (?). So there might be a possible approach here that doesn't break much existing code, if we forbid the use of `Rc` only when all 4 points apply.\n\nI don't think we can add \"prevent only certain kinds of memory leaks\" to the 1.0 goals without delaying the release. On the other hand, releasing 1.0 with an unstable or heavily restricted `Rc` is certainly not an option. Once we release 1.0 with the ability to write a safe `mem::forget`, it'll always be possible to write a safe `mem::forget`. (though we still could invent `!Leak` types that cannot be used with `mem::forget`)\n",

I hope using a sort of \"strictly outlives\" constraint, it can be set up so that the only reference to the RCs will be cycles at the point where extra-strong is dropped, so there are no dangling pointers. The same lifetime constraints would prevent putting the extra-strong reference in the `Rc` graph it owns. Thus we recover a guarantee of no leaks.\n\nI don't claim to have found some cycle-breaking panacea--this different restricts the use of non-static RC. But are the restrictions much more over than what is already imposed by the the borrow checker on non-`'static` `Rc`? Do they interfere with the known use cases?\n\nOn second thought, this is vaguely like getting the scope proxy ideom from https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1084 and using it to ensure clean up of non-`'static'`Rc` graphs instead forked threads.\n",

It is misleading for novices (like me).\n> \n> The API is coming back, so this is mostly a temporary state.\n\nGuys, do you realise how ridiculous this looks? Let's see:\n\n\"Hi, I read about this amazing scoped threads feature in Rust, but... I can't actually find it? What's the deal?\"\n\n\"Oh, that... The thing is... [wiggle squirm] We actually dropped it like half a year ago... But it's just temporary! We have ideas for a replacement! In fact, if you spend half a day wading through discussions on issues and pull requests, perhaps you will ultimately stumble upon a crate far away called Crossbeam that indeed implements a viable replacement, stuffed in along with various other experimental features... And surely something along these lines will someday somehow end up in the standard library again in some form (even though nothing actually seems to be happening regarding that right now)...  So you see, it's all temporary! No need to even mention it in existing literature!\"\n\n\"Riiiiiight.... [slowly backing away] You know, I think I'll actually look for some other language... But you kids keep having fun!\"\n",

    "body": "> You don't need crossbeam. [...] https://crates.io/crates/scoped_threadpool gives you the functionality.\n\nPools are nice; yet crossbeam::Scope seems a more straightforward replacement for the old functionality?...\n\nAnyway, debating this actually serves to demonstrate the existing  confusion and lack of communication regarding this situation; creating an unacceptable story for any newcomer. thread::scoped() is prominently featured in a major piece of Rust advocacy (the mentioned [blog post](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html)), without any hint that it's gone, or where to look for replacements; nor am I aware of any other clear communication regarding this, that people looking for thread::scoped() are likely to find -- and nobody seems to be willing to even acknowledge that there is a communication problem...\n\nIf my post wasn't substantial in illustrating how this feels to people outside the bubble, I really don't know what would be.\n",
