  "body": "`EmitterWriter::print_maybe_styled` was basically always used with `format!`, so this macro makes some code cleaner. It should also remove some unnecessary allocations (most `print_maybe_styled` invocations allocated a `String` previously, whereas the new macro uses `write_fmt` to write the formatted string directly to the terminal).\n\nThis probably could have been part of #26838, but it\u2019s too late now. It\u2019s also rebased on #26838\u2019s branch because otherwise pretty much all of the changes in this PR would conflict with the other PR\u2019s changes.\n",
