It's pretty unfortunate we stabilized the `flags` accessor in the first place IMO, but oh well.\n\nI'm a little less sure about `fill`, though. What `char` is returned if no fill character was specified? Why doesn't it return an `Option` like the others? Is `char` sufficient? Should it be a full grapheme instead?\n",

Currently whenever something is formatted you have the ability to specify a \"fill\" character which for when padding is applied (normally this is just an ascii space). As @sfackler points out this fill is currently just a `char`, but it could in theory be a grapheme in terms of \"one thing on the screen\". Do you have an opinion either way in that regard?

    "body": "Uh. It\u2019s not just graphemes. The whole `width`/`align`/`fill` thing in `std::fmt` as currently written is based on some assumptions:\n1. We\u2019re printing to something that (like most terminal emulators) align text on a grid\n2. [The number of grid slots occupied by a piece of text is the number of UTF-8 bytes (`&str::len`)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8fe79bdfdacb2f5914971bd1a0b63b9577afbf6a/src/libcore/fmt/mod.rs#L863).\n3. [It\u2019s the number of `char` code points](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8fe79bdfdacb2f5914971bd1a0b63b9577afbf6a/src/libcore/fmt/mod.rs#L874)\n4. [Printing a `char` occupies one slot on the grid](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8fe79bdfdacb2f5914971bd1a0b63b9577afbf6a/src/libcore/fmt/mod.rs#L993-L995)\n\nUnfortunately, as often with Unicode, it\u2019s complicated. Not only grapheme clusters can have more than one code point and still only use one slot (with combining code points), but most characters of some Asian languages and most emoji are \u201cfull width\u201d: they\u2019re twice the usual width in most monospace fonts. Control characters [might or might not](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Mar/0476.html) be displayed. Or they might be interpreted by the terminal to move the cursor around.\n\nhttp://eev.ee/blog/2015/09/12/dark-corners-of-unicode/#combining-characters-and-character-width has some more background. Here is an extract, about emoji flags:\n\n> So the \u201clength\u201d of a pair of these characters depends both on the display font (which may not support all flags), and on the current geopolitical state of the world. How\u2019s that for depending on global mutable state?\n\n---\n\nOur best bet for \u201dwhat is the width of this string?\u201d is probably https://github.com/unicode-rs/unicode-width\n\nThat leaves dealing with `fill` if it\u2019s double width or a control character. If we want to do it, could `fill` be an arbitrary string rather than a single `char`? Or should `width(fill) != 1` be rejected?\n",
