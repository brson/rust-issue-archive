As far as I can tell, the in-tree `derive(RustcEncodable,RustcDecodeable)` stuff is used directly by the `rustc-serialize` package, and will continue to be used at least until compiler plugins are stabilized. (Sorry to have gotten some of the names wrong in my previous message.)\n\nIn other words, I think that the in-tree plugins are used directly by the out-of-tree code, and the in-tree plugins have some moderately serious issues. This _can_ be worked around in `rustc-serialize`, but only by discarding all special-case support for struct variants and tuple structs.\n\nI don't necessarily think that we can or should fix the in-tree stuff at this point. But I do think that the in-tree stuff could have used one more pass of API fixes, assuming it really is used by `rustc-serialize`, which I understand to be the case. But I'm happy to be corrected if my information re: rustc-serialize and how it interfaces to the compiler is wrong or out of date.\n\nSorry for the terse and possibly confused messages; I'm juggling way too much stuff this week.\n",

    "body": "OK, here are the other related issues on the decode side:\n1. Modify `Decodable`/`RustcDecodable` to call `read_enum_struct_variant` and `read_enum_struct_variant_field`. This  may involve a non-backwards-compatible change to `read_enum`, which currently offers the caller no way to determine whether to call `read_enum_variant` or `read_enum_struct_variant`.\n2. Modify  `Decodable`/`RustcDecodable` to call `read_tuple_struct`.\n\nI'm not sure whether this is 100% backwards-compatible. I'm not seeing an obvious solution. I might be able to find some time next week to work on this, if people think that's desirable and appropriate. If we can't fix this in the compiler, my tentative recommendation is to remove all the struct variant and tuple struct from `rustc-serialization`. This is suboptimal, especially for tuple structs (which get bogus field names under the current system), but it might be the best we can do.\n\nAnyway, I'm very open to suggestions, and I might be able to find a day to work on this if that helps.\n",

    "body": "Hm, it looks like `read_enum` delegates to the yielded closure to call `read_enum_variant` or `read_enum_struct_variant` itself. It looks like you can give `read_enum_variant` a list of names for possible enum variants that can be read, and the closure will respond with which enum variant should be decoded. It looks like there's no way to say \"read a variant\" and the decoder responds with \"ok, here's a regular variant\" or \"ok, here's a struct variant\". Changing that would likely change the input `names: &[&str]`  to `read_enum_variant` to something like `names: &[RegularVariantOrStructVariantName]` (or something like that).\n\nAlso no worries! There's certainly no rush here :)\n",

    "body": "OK. In that case, does it even make sense to have a separate `read_enum_struct_variant` call? Or should `read_enum_variant` handle all kinds of variants, and then allow the callback `f` to decide whether to call `read_enum_variant_arg` and `read_enum_struct_variant_field` as appropriate? (And if we go with this design, should `read_enum` and `read_enum_variant` just be collapsed into one function call?)\n\nI'm quite happy to proceed with whatever design makes sense, but I've only worked on one idiosyncratic encoder/decoder pair, so I'm especially eager for feedback on the design.\n",
