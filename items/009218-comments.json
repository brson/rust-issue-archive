Yes, you need mingw toolchain anyway (#3459):\n- rustc uses external linker `g++.exe`.\n- Currently all binary depends on mingw runtime including libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll, libstdc++-6.dll and libpthread-2.dll.\n\nMoreover, it is more puzzling to install mingw because of version incompatibility. :( For example, if you get mingw via mingw-installer, it installs `libstdc++-6.dll` which is incompatible to rust. You have to download it manually. Other binaries cause similar issues and you have to search wiki/issues for information.\n",

    "body": "klutzy,\n\nIt sounds like in order to get rustc to work on Win64, I'll have to manually put the dependency chain together on the basis of hints/tips/clues scattered across various Wiki pages and Github issues. While I'm really interested in Rust, I'll pass on that.\n\nI think that if the Rust team are at all interested in attracting some attention to this language (which from what I can tell it deserves), the lack of a reasonably clear way to get Rust working on the number 1 desktop platform is a pretty serious obstacle. There doesn't necessarily have to be a one-click MSI installer, but a reliable, up-to-date how-to guide would make world of difference.\n\nThanks for your replies.\n",
