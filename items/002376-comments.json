It's a common pattern in Rust, but it's not a common pattern in class constructors in most languages, where you are free to build up the fields over the course of the constructor. It's a lot of boilerplate.\n",

    "body": "So I was thinking again and there are a couple of arguments in favor of static functions that mean (IMHO) that we shouldn't shoot them down so quickly:\n- It allows constructors to fail in an in-band way without failing the task, by returning a result. This could be very important.\n- It allows classes to have multiple constructors. Almost all OO languages I know of have some facility for this.\n\nWe could sidestep the name resolution problems by having the record literal syntax for class construction be module-private by default, and not having static functions per se at all. This is a little hokey, but the more I think about it the more I think it isn't terrible; you can make other things be module-private, so why not constructors?\n",

    "body": "@pcwalton I don't think it's that hokey. It wouldn't really be that the record literal syntax is module-private -- it would be that the literal constructor (`C` in `C{x: 5, y: 7}`, to use a strawperson syntax) is module-private. It would just fall out of that that the literal syntax would be module-private, since you can't write the literal syntax without a constructor name.\n",
