    "body": "The addition of the `reserve_index` and `reserve_index_exact` new methods on `Vec` may actually require a new RFC to add. Recently @aturon and @Gankro did some awesome work to create a consistent story for all our collections, and this story [currently doesn't include](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0235-collections-conventions.md#implicit-growth) these methods. Could you move these changes to a separate PR? You may also want to discuss with @aturon or @Gankro on IRC beforehand to talk about rationale and such.\n\nThe addition of the standard `capacity`, `reserve`, and `reserve_exact` functions on `VecMap` seem great though, and I'd love to whisk them through to bors quickly!\n",
