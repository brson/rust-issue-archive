    "body": "I'm going to approach this another way. The replacement of the C library allocator will be a choice at compile-time but I don't think the sacrifices necessary to do the same thing for _internal_ usage of jemalloc make sense.\n\nIt's still worth mixing jemalloc with the system allocator on most platforms, and those with jemalloc as the system allocator can be dealt with by having it call into that directly. It can just be hardcoded to use the system allocator in all cases on FreeBSD, etc.\n",
