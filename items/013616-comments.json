    "body": "I was thinking that we should add back jemalloc, but this time as a submodule (it's even hosted on GitHub now) and without trying to replace `malloc`/`realloc`/`free` with it (by adding a prefix). This would give us the consistent jemalloc debugging API across platforms including heap profiling, zero/junk filling of memory, debugging, leak detection and statistics. It would also force us to fix any bugs where we're mixing `malloc`/`free` and our own allocators since it's going to die horribly.\n\nWe would be able to leverage the jemalloc-specific API to implement an allocator API like my proposal at https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/39. The API could just be marked experimental for now, because it's going to take a while to settle on details like the best way to report a usable size and whether passing a size to free should be optional, mandatory or done in some completely different way.\n",
