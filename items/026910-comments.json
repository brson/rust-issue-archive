However, I guess the change is only worthwhile if we use the error message from lang items in the errors, which we don't and I don't want to do. So, here is a version without the Result change. The treatment of owned_box becomes a little ad hoc, but then our treatment of owned box seems pretty ad hoc already.\n",
