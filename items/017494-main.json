  "body": "This commit is another in the series of vector slice API stabilization. The focus here is the _mutable_ slice API.\n\nLargely, this API inherits the stability attributes [previously assigned](rust-lang#16332) to the analogous methods on immutable slides. It also adds comments to a few `unstable` attributes that were previously missing them.\n\nIn addition, the commit adds several `_mut` variants of APIs that were missing:\n- `init_mut`\n- `head_mut`\n- `tail_mut`\n- `splitn_mut`\n- `rsplitn_mut`\n\nSome of the unsafe APIs -- `unsafe_set`, `init_elem`, and `copy_memory` -- were deprecated in favor of working through `as_mut_ptr`, to simplify the API surface.\n\nDue to deprecations, this is a:\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
