It might be that the right thing to do here is to just assume the most generic cpu we can (i686, x86-64) in cases where --opt-level is < 2, instead of having a special wide-distribution option or having to differentiate the targets in these simple cases. \n\nI am digging around in LLVM to see how this stuff is used and set.\n\nA couple of things would be useful here: \n- could you post or message me the output of cat /proc/cpuinfo on the 64-bit linux build machine?\n- does rust do any inline asm?  There are two code paths that use the feature string and cpu type and being able to ignore one of them would be nice.\n",
