    "body": "Thanks for picking this up @LeoTestard! I think there's definitely an interesting question of defaults here, so it's something I wouldn't mind exploring a bit.\n\nI would be a little wary to turn this on by default as I haven't seen much precedent for CLI tools using unicode symbols by default, but on the other hand I feel like if it's turned off by default it may just end up being dead code in the compiler. For example Cargo wouldn't have an easy method of passing this down to the compiler so it'd probably end up happening that the vast majority of compiler invocations don't pass this option. \n\nSo along those lines, this seems cool, but I'm a little wary about landing this for now. cc @rust-lang/tools, though, other opinions?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I agree. We have several options here. As @wthrowe and other people said, GCC does use Unicode output by default when the locale includes UTF-8. An other option would be an environment variable, as suggested in the previous thread. This way the user can specify that it wants the Unicode output to be enabled without Cargo having to know anything about it. A third possibility is a global configuration file for Cargo in which it is possible to specify this kind of things. Both those options allow not to set Unicode output as the default in the compiler.\n",
