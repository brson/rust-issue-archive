I think it'd be a nice touch.\n\nOf course, there's not much difference between that and /*\\* ... */, aside from the latter being a syntax rustc doesn't know yet and would have to learn to consume, attach to items properly and reproduce.

    "body": "Yeah. I'm a bit torn. I hate to make decisions like this based on \"what's easy to implement\", but the fact is that comment-preservation and manipulation -- much less \"associating a comment with an item\" -- is much less solid in the compiler than the treatment of attributes, so in the near-term it feels like attributes are the thing that will \"work\" here without serious front-end surgery. And attributes already have, as brson points out, a lightweight structured syntax in case you want your docs to have additional fiddly bits (per-parameter docs, warnings, notes, see-also links, deprecated flags, etc.)\n\nOn the other hand, I recognize that javadoc /*\\* ... */ style doc-comments have become somewhat de facto in many languages in this family.\n\nHow about we start with an attribute syntax and if people complain we can add a secondary mode that considers /*\\* ... _/ as a special compiler-supported syntax for #[doc=...]? So long as the AST node marks whether the attr came from /_\\* ... _/ or not, it should be possible to pretty-print in much the same place we permit attributes. Just requires recognizing /_\\* at the start of a comment block.\n",
