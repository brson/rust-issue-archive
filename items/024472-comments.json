    "body": "I can't think of anything that would trigger on x86 hardware, because AFAIK the relevant instructions don't care about alignment. The problem was discovered on an ARMv5 that has rather \"interesting\" behaviour on unaligned loads.\n\nThe only thing I can think of would indeed be to verify the LLVM IR, but we have no infrastructure for that yet. What do you think of repurposing the codegen test directory to perform checks on the LLVM IR using LLVM's `FileCheck`? While the intention behind the code size ratio tests that currently live there was good, we never really got a meaningful number of tests there, and the idea behind them is somewhat flawed, because things like the lifetime or assume intrinsics can inflate the code size, yet lead to better results.\n",
