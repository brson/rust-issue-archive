Almost all examples involving integers use `int`.\n\nI'm not sure there is a consensus on using `int/uint` for pointers and sizes only. Right now, all the documentation is encouraging the use of `int`.\n",

    "body": "I agree we need to figure out our story regarding `int/uint`; I've nominated #15526 for that.\n\nIn addition, while playing around with some code that uses `Bitv`, I wondered: would it be feasible for it to have a default type-parameter for the `Key` type, that puts a static bound on the size of the universe.  The `Key` would presumably default to `uint`, i.e. today's type ... the reason that I was thinking this could be nice is that it _might_ improve the ergonomics of using `Bitv` in the scenario where you are only working with 8- or 16- or 32-bit values, max; right now to use `Bitv` in such scenarios, you need to use checked casts (via `to_type().unwrap()`), which is unergonomic, or unchecked casts (via `as`), which is, well, unchecked.\n",
