    "body": "Making them behave identical across platforms will incur a performance penalty for some calls on some platforms. I think that this is not acceptable for performance critical calls like pow().  This leaves us with three alternatives: \n\n(a) define the deviating behavior as officially undefined and thereby push the burden of handling this to the user \n\n(b) use our own implementation of floating point ops, perhaps by incorporating some C math library directly into the rust runtime or at least allowing easy integration with a common math library\n\n(c) complete implementation of libm in rust. This would be very nice but also very much work and requires someone who knows how to write fast numeric code.\n\nFor case (b), this is a list of possible candidates from a quick search\n- http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm/links.html\n- http://sourceware.org/newlib/libm.html\n- BSD libm\n",
