    "body": "Nominating.\n\nI recently investigated into the rust-http benchmarks which show the RPS for libnative is over 2x larger than libgreen. I found that with `RUST_THREADS=1` libgreen was 7% faster than libnative (and libnative had the benefit of being concurrent).\n\nIn my opinion, this is a serious obstacle to widespread acceptance of libgreen. Until this issue is fixed, I feel that the common workloads will be much slower than they need to be. Another example of a workload showing this pathological performance is a highly contended mutex.\n",

A neighbour can just be defined as a scheduler whose id is our id +1 or -1.\n\nThe downside would be that waking up a scheduler now takes O(n).

    "body": "Those are some very promising results!\n\nMy idea for this would be to have some sort of a handle to your left and right neighbors. This handle might be a `SchedHandle`, but it may also be some other handle. One of the great parts about only caring about the left and right neighbors is that you avoid any global state, so that's something that I think that we'd definitely want to move towards (not having a global sleeper list).\n\nI don't think that the handles will be so much of a lock-free structure as a wakeup mechanism for schedulers. They'll probably have a uv async handle along with a flag as to whether the scheduler is sleeping or not. Note that the crucial aspect is that the flag is false while the scheduler is performing exponential backoff before sleeping, and it's true only when the scheduler has completely blocked.\n\nThose are just some scattered thoughts, though.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Could you explain what you mean by exponential backoff of sleeping?  Is it like, rather than directly going to sleep, a scheduler would first wait for like 1ms and try to run its current task again.  If still blocked, it waits for like 2ms and tries again.  Then 4ms, 8ms, until it hits a threshold, in which case it actually goes to sleep.\n\nAlso, I imagine the sleep flag will need to be an atomic boolean?\n",

    "body": "Right now, when a scheduler goes to sleep (executes [this code](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libgreen/sched.rs#L296-L312)), it will go back to libuv, and the OS thread will be blocked in `epoll`. Waking up a scheduler from `epoll` is pretty expensive, so we were thinking that a scheduler should expoentially backoff in sleeping before hitting epoll. \n\nThe idea is that while doing this exponential backoff, the scheduler won't receive messages to wake up (it doesn't look like it's asleep). In doing so, when we have a high volume of serial work across many tasks, one scheduler will be doing all the work and fanning out the unblocked tasks to its neighbors. These neighbors would finish the work quickly, and then block the task again. These neighbor schedulers would never hit `epoll` and the main scheduler would never wake them up. The \"I'm asleep\" flag would indeed probably be an atomic, and it would be `false` during this backoff.\n\nA complication is that I don't think that exponential backoff should happen while there are active I/O handles. Otherwise, this exponential backoff will starve any tasks which have an I/O completion callback to run.\n\nThe exact tuning of parameters is something I'm not quite sure about. The idea is something along the lines of wait for N units of time, then wait for 2N units of time, all the way up to 2^M \\* N units of time at which point you hit epoll. The values of N and M will likely need lots of tuning to get right.\n",

When a scheduler has a task it isn't supposed to execute it is sent to the friend. Right now there is only one friend, but if we added a second and made an explicit ring that could replace the sleeper list, and also add fanout to the pinned task usecase. It probably still has the pathalogical case of a scheduler only allowed to run pinned tasks spawning many unpinned tasks, which are then all sent to the same friend.\n",

    "body": "I took a stab at getting rid of the sleeper list, and this code appears to pass the tests. Based very heavily on @derekchiang's work. \n\nThe shutdown strategy is really fishy though, and I'm fairly certain there is a bad race condition where shutting down a subset of the schedulers will leave it in a broken state. When a scheduler shuts down it notifies neighbors that they have new neighbors, but if one of those neighbors is shutting down too the receiver discards the new neighbor request instead of forwarding it, as it can't forward it because it already gave away its neighbor handles. The still-extant neighbors also then get handles to the shutting down schedulers as their neighbors, keeping them alive. It is a little more complicated too because I have the right neighbor responsible for updating the left neighbor, haven't worked out all the details of how this plays out.\n\nIs the \"shut down some of your schedulers and continue\" usecase supported by libgreen? \n\nThe only dynamic scheduler set stuff I could find was for spawning schedulers to run a single task and exit. So I left spawn_sched schedulers out of the ring, as they don't need to be woken up that way. (I think?) Should spawn_sched join the ring to allow for dynamically scaling up the thread pool? I'm currently ignoring that use case because I haven't seen it used, and that is questionable.\n\nhttps://github.com/toddaaro/rust/commit/23a8057c5a70b544f516e01854bacddc4d3b6032\n\n(And warning, the code is messy/uncleaned)\n",

    "body": "The current `SchedPool` interface allows insertion of a new scheduler, but it currently doesn't allow for removal. The reason for this is that there is no set point in time where all I/O handles to a scheduler have gone away, and the scheduler needs to stay alive as long as there are I/O handles.\n\nIt would be a little sad to add another reason that schedulers couldn't be shut down, but that's not necessarily the end of the world. I do think, however, that adding a new scheduler should insert it into the ring of schedulers rather than putting it on the side.\n",

There seem to be many situations in which a workload won't actually fan out properly, and I don't think it is reasonable for a user to think about how to avoid these cases. \n\nA simple one is if there is one task spawning all the work. A listening socket that spawns workers based on an input for example. As work comes in and tasks are spawned, this scheduler would wake up both its neighbors so they could process work. It could be the case though that these tasks don't ever need to spawn additional tasks, so they would never wake up their neighbors. As a result there would only ever be 3 schedulers working in this system. \n\nI think making the ring work requires a fallback of some sort to ensure that proper fanout does happen.
