  "body": "Fixes  #22080.\n\nI was working on adding examples to the documentation in `std::num::Float`. I got to `exp2`, which says \"Returns 2 raised to the power of the number, `2^(self)`.\"\n\nSo I tried running this code:\n\n```\nuse std::num::Float;\n\n#[test]\nfn test_exp2() {\n    assert_eq!(32.0, 5.0.exp2());\n}\n```\n\nand it resulted in a failure of `(left: `32`, right: `148.413159`)`. That 148.413159 is the value for e^5, which is `exp()`, not `exp2()`.\n\nSure enough, `exp2` is calling `exp` and shouldn't be, looks like a copy-paste error. \n\nI haven't added any tests for this since it's unlikely to break again, but I will happily do so if people think that would be a good idea. The doc examples are coming :)\n\nI scanned through the other functions in these files for similar sorts of errors and didn't notice any.\n",
