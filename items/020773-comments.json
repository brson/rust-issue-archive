    "body": "So I'm of the opinion that we want functions like `weak_rng` in the root `std::rand` module and less of things like `ChaCha20`. If I'm a random person that needs an RNG, I either want a fast RNG and don't care much about the security of it, or need a secure source of randomness for crypto or whatever. If I see `weak_rng` and `crypto_rng` functions (or whatever we want to call them), I'm happy. If I have to go hunting around to see what the hell `ChaCha20`, `Isaac64`, and `XorShiftRng` are and what the differences are, I'm going to be wasting time, and there's a decent chance I'm going to screw up and use an insecure RNG for something that I need a secure RNG for or use some slow and secure RNG to make dice rolls for my video game.

    "body": "We have the \"obvious\" name `StdRng` as a default choice, and the thread RNG (which most people use) is also designed to be somewhat secure, including reseeding itself from the OS regularly. (Of course, `OsRng` is still the thing to use for applications that actually need security.)\n\nI 100% agree we don't need all of those types. I'm actually thinking that we switch to `ChaChaRng` for `StdRng` and move the ISAAC RNGs to an external library, leaving us with just `StdRng`, `ChaChaRng` and `XorShiftRng` (and `OsRng`). I guess `WeakRng` may fit into this some how. I suppose we could do some straight-out renaming, like `ChaChaRng` to `StdRng` and/or `XorShiftRng` to `WeakRng`, without having duplication.\n\nThat said, there's going to be a close analysis of `std::rand` in future, before 1.0, for stabilisation; which I think is the right place to consider these sorts of things. I feel the move away from free functions brings `rand` more closely into line with the other parts of `std`, and we can consider the \"do crypto right\" aspect later.\n\n(BTW, @nagisa, could you amend the commit message to include the suggested migration path, `weak_rng()`  &rarr; `random::<XorShiftRng>()`? It's helpful for people reading the breaking change log.)\n",
