I'd like @aturon to second that, however.\n\nCould you also retain the old `AtomicInt`/`AtomicUint` types entirely in order to smooth over migration? I think we're going to try to fairly aggressively try to smooth transitions during this release cycle. Unfortunately a `pub use` won't actually trigger deprecation warnings, so an entire duplication will be needed, but that's not too too bad so long as the documentation is all deleted!\n",

    "body": "Just saw this from This-Week-In-Rust. This won't be a big deal in practice, but this change creates the mis-implication that pointer-width (which is the basis of `isize` and `usize`) is the same size as the memory data bus (which is the number of bits that can be read-from and written-to atomically). There is no such necessary relationship, it is possible to have a 64-bit pointer width and an 8-bit data bus, in which case the 64-bit write would be translated into 8 memory transactions by the CPU. It turns out that the numbers are the same on most platforms (based on http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Atomic-Types.html), so this implication shouldn't generally cause issues, but it's worth noting.\n",
