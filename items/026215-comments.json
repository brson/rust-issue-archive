It used to just talk about data races, but we felt that was too weak -- it didn't really capture the full benefits of `Send`/`Sync`. Hopefully we can find an equally concise, but more precise statement. Failing that, I'd be more comfortable with understating rather than overstating (even if we included an asterisk).\n\nWe can always make the home page bullets link to various of the blog posts we've been publishing to explain Rust's vision in more detail, and that can help clarify the extent of the benefits of each.\n",

    "body": "NB. Rust does actually provide tools that allow this sort of code to be guaranteed-correct. The problem here is there's high-level semantics imposed on a plain integer, which is far too general for the compiler to know if the code is correct (for all the compiler knows it may be fine for the value to change between the two critical sections). Using a custom type allows imposing higher-order constraints. In this case, moving (instead of copying) is enough to guarantee the semantics you want:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};\nuse std::thread;\n\n#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]\npub struct Value {\n    x: i32\n}\nimpl Value {\n    pub fn new(x: i32) -> Value { Value { x: x } }\n\n    pub fn increment(&mut self) { self.x += 1; }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let p = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Value::new(0)));\n\n    for _ in 1..100 {\n        let x = p.clone();\n        thread::spawn(move || {\n            let n;\n            {\n                let mut x_ = x.lock().unwrap();\n                x_.increment();\n                n = *x_;\n            }\n            thread::sleep_ms(50);\n            {\n                // because Rust guarantees thread-safety, we can safely assume x hasn't been changed\n                let x_ = x.lock().unwrap();\n                if *x_ != n {\n                    panic!();\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    thread::sleep_ms(2000);\n}\n```\n\n```\n<anon>:24:21: 24:24 error: cannot move out of borrowed content\n<anon>:24                 n = *x_;\n                              ^~~\n```\n\nhttps://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=782b015afec0d2ea63bc&version=stable&run=1\n\nDon't get me wrong: the original code is still doesn't do what you intended (i.e. Rust isn't automatically guarantee the \"thread-safety\" that that code wants), but still it is nice that it _is_ possible to do so.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis I think Rust's thread safety guarantees shine the strongest in generic code.  Specifically: in safe code, any function generic over `T` (such that parametricity is preserved) _cannot_ be involved a data race through a value of type `T`.  Period.  Not even one that doesn't cause memory unsafety (because there _isn't_ any way to avoid causing memory unsafety over a totally generic `T` without making sure reads and writes through it are atomic, thanks to things like fat pointers, slices, and enums that aren't safe even given guaranteed atomicity for word-sized writes).\n\nAs far as I know, the only time Java guarantees anything anywhere near that strong is during `final` variable initialization, or situations where the VM takes a lock under the hood (e.g. dynamic class loading).  Java avoids the aforementioned problems by simply not having such types in the language; C# avoids them (AFAIK) by heavily restricting operations on value types.  Both rely on the garbage collector to avoid use after free on pointer dereferences (I think `Copy` basically satisfies the requirement that this not be an issue, though).  Rust neither avoids nor restricts its value types in this manner, and lacks a garbage collector (and will always lack a general concurrent one, AFAIK), so it has to work harder to achieve the same guarantees.\n\nOf course, there is nothing stopping people from writing an `unsafe` trait that relaxes these guarantees for types where data races are memory safe; indeed, such a trait would be quite useful!  However, no such trait exists currently (that I'm aware of) and requiring it violates parametricity.  Moreover, for any trait that _doesn't_ guarantee \"this type is safe in the presence of races\" (i.e. all existing unsafe traits that I am currently aware of, and all safe traits), the original reasoning applies; in particular, the claim is still valid for`T: Sync` and `T: Send`, one or both of which must be a prerequisite for any concurrent data structure.  So in practice, any safe, _generic_, concurrent data structure in Rust (`Mutex<T>`, for example!) must enforce the above strong property.\n\nI think this is the key to why it feels like Rust is enforcing something stronger than data race safety.  But I have no idea how to express it succinctly.  It would help if the Rust standard library _did_ define the hypothetical trait I mention above somewhere (`Race`?), because it would make the explanation a good deal simpler (but still not simple enough to make a one liner on Rust's home page).\n",
