If the goal is to continue to do what C does, then I'm perfectly happy to just close this.\n\nIn general, I find that 99% of the time I'm printing a pointer is because I'll copypaste it elsewhere (generally a python repl), do some math on it, then do something with it elsewhere. Given this workflow, padding them all to the native pointer width of the platform cases them to line up neatly, make it easy to eyeball if you have a bunch of values all on page boundaries, etc.\n\nThe rationale for the change is pretty much entirely that I would assume this will only be used in debugging, and for that usecase, padded pointers seem much more user friendly to me.\n",
