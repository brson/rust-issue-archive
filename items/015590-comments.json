Exactly the one as in the first message.\n\n@sfackler, yes, you're right, its a dependency of the plugin. But I don't think it is Cargo responsibility. Cargo is not an obligatory thing to use, why does plain `rustc` users must suffer? And after all, it did work previously.\n\nI just checked, passing `-C rpath` to `rustc` while compiling the dependency did help. Hopefully, cargo will allow adding global flags to `rustc` soon.\n",

    "body": "After trying a few things, I'm not sure what the best way to go about this is. I can think of three possibilities for taking action on this issue:\n1. Add the relevant paths to the global environment variable while rustc is executing. Sadly this only works on Windows, not on linux or OSX who apparently cache the value of the environment variable on startup (or something similar) so changes at runtime aren't detected. I am unaware of a method to instruct the dynamic linker that a new path is available at runtime.\n2. Instead of relying on the dynamic linker to figure everything out, figure everything out ourselves. This would involve calling `dlopen` on each of the dependent libraries in topological order in order to get up to the actual plugin. I've tried this out and it dies quite quickly because it's dlopening two copies of rustc. Additionally I'm not 100% sure if it's a plausible course of action, and it would certainly require a good bit more machinery to manage if, if it would work at all.\n3. Close as WONTFIX.\n\nThis is a direct consequence of removing rpaths, but I'm not sure how much the compiler can do for you.\n",
