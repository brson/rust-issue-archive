    "body": "This does not appear to be an issue anymore, ever since the change to `proc` instead of `fn`.  The syntax is different than a `&fn`, so the compiler can no longer get confused.  The equivalent code after the change: `let _:Option<proc()> = Some(proc() {})` compiles just fine.  Closing this.\n",
