    "body": "> Terminates the current process with the specified exit code.\n> \n> This function will never return and will immediately terminate the current process. The exit code is passed through to the underlying OS and will be available for consumption by another process.\n> \n> Note that because this function never returns, and that it terminates the process, no destructors on the current stack or any other thread's stack will be run. If a clean shutdown is needed it is recommended to only call this function at a known point where there are no more destructors left to run.\n\nLooks like they are terminated instantly. The destructor question is explicitly addressed -- they do not run, in any thread.\n",
