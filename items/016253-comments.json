    "body": "This looks good. Sorry it took me some time. The main thing that's missing are more tests. There ought to be tests for:\n1. Mutation is allowed if declared mutable (you have this).\n2. Mutation is NOT allowed if NOT declared mutable (didn't see this).\n3. Tests for lint:\n   - set the lint mode to forbid and add that to test #1 so as to test that we don't get spurious errors here\n   - set the lint mode to forbid and then write a test that reads `let mut` (with a closure) but does not mutate it, and check that you do in fact get a warning\n",
