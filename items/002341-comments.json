Curiously enough the code/tests I have added seem to work correctly outside of the std::bitv module - so I think something weird is happening here.\n",

It's not too surprising that you could get different behavior inside and outside the `bitv` module, as the compiler does some things differently for inside-the-crate vs. outside-the-crate things (though if it changes observable behavior, that's a bug).\n",
