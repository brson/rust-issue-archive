  "body": "This patch set implements code generation for ports and channels. I think this is all pretty nice - the only thing I'm really concerned about is the refcounting. From what I can tell the refcounts are working correctly; I just don't exactly understand why. I expected trans_recv to require a cleanup for the received data but it has thus far rejected my efforts to do so.\n\nI'm beginning to understand what's going on in trans.rs, but please give it a close look and see if there's anything I can improve. \n\nNext is implementing local declarations with receive, e.g. \"let int x <- p\", then on to spawning tasks.\n",
