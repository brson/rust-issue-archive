    "body": "@Ms2ger\n\nCould you extend it into a real unsoundness? I don't think this is a real problem: the trait type is `for<'a> fn(&'a Foo, &'a Foo) -> &'a Foo`, which is a subtype of the impl type `for<'a,'s> fn(&'s Foo, &'a Foo) -> &'a Foo` - it requires both of the argument lifetimes to be the same as the output lifetime, not just the second argument's lifetime, and we allow impl-types to be subtypes of the trait-type (e.g. you can even replace the return type with `&'static Foo` - of course only if you also adjust `get_style`'s body - and it would still work).\n",
