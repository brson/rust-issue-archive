  "body": "This gives LLVM the data required to inline (i.e. writes the AST to the crate), but doesn't force it to, like `#[inline]` (which is actually just a hint, but is apparently very aggressive) or `#[inline(always)]`.\n\nI'm not sure how to test, but given:\n\n``` rust\n// inline_maybe.rs\n#[inline(maybe)]\npub fn foo() -> int { 1 }\n\n// inline_maybe2.rs\nextern mod inline_maybe;\nuse inline_maybe::foo;\nfn main() {\n    if foo() == 2 {\n        print(\"hi\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith a pre-`inline(maybe)` rustc the asm for `inline_maybe2.rs` contains:\n\n``` asm\n    callq   _ZN3foo15_8faebfb4af26143_00E@PLT\n    cmpq    $1, %rax\n    jne .LBB0_4\n```\n\nWith this patch, the `foo` call is inlined and constant-folded away. (with `-O`.)\n\nWith a huge `foo` (that wouldn't be normally inlined, even within the same crate) with `inline(maybe)`, the actual call remains in `inline_maybe2`, i.e. it isn't inlined.\n\nI'm not sure about two lines (my line comment), but I'm unsure who's most appropriate to consult/familiar with this code.\n",
