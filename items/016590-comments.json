    "body": "In the D programming language every now and then someone comes to the newsgroup saying \"I have this strangest bug, this is working wrong\", only to get the answer \"you are comparing a signed int with an unsigned one\". This happens because array lengths are also unsigned ints there.\n\nBe prepared to have these bugs and get similar questions from people using Rust. In my opinion, it makes sense that the length of a vector or an array is unsigned (it can't be negative), but if you make it a signed integer it isn't a big drawback and you will never have these kinds of bugs.\n\nC#'s Array.length is signed: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.array.length(v=vs.110).aspx\n\nJava's Array length (and other types) are also ints (well, I think they don't have unsigned types).\n\nI never heard anyone running into these bugs in Python, Ruby, Javascript, etc., either.\n\nThis program has an unexpected answer:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n  let a = [1, 2, 3];\n  println!(\"{}\", a.len() > -1);\n}\n```\n\n(and, as a side note, this program crashes the compiler:)\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n  println!(\"{}\", [].len() > -1);\n}\n```\n\nPlease, consider using unsigned ints as least as possible. Thanks :-)\n",
