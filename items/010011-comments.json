They could come about due to memory safety problems, trusting externally-supplied data, numeric overflow, underlying OS and network flaws, etc.\n\nSomething I learned in an IEEE Reliability Society talk is the path to reliability is eliminating as many failure modes as possible. Their example was automotive: Rather than diddle with the probability of A/C hoses rusting out, just use a material that doesn't corrode.\n",

    "body": "I'd like to see a Rust example where this is actually a possibility. Between autoderef and the type checker, I'm not sure if it's possible to introduce an actual bug. I mean, sure, there probably is _some_ case, but I can't think of one that is caused purely by operator precedence mistakes.\n\nIf you do `*foo.abc()` you are dereferencing the result of caling the `abc` method. If that type is not a pointer, then you'll get an error. If it is a pointer, then it should either be safe to dereference, a raw pointer (and therefore in an unsafe block), or a compile time error. The same ideas apply to `(*foo).abc()` except that code would only make sense if foo was a raw pointer, making the dereference itself unsafe.\n\nI'm closing this as unproductive, with no obvious advantage beyond \"don't have to worry about operator precedence in this one case where it probably doesn't matter anyway\", I can't see this happening. If you can provide a compelling example, this issue can be re-opened.\n",

Maybe if `state` points to an FSM state and `(*state).next(token)` returns the next FSM state pointer given an input token, then `*state.next(token)` === `*(state.next(token))` gets the next state (not state pointer)... The type checker will catch that. With type inference the error message might be downstream but hopefully it'll still be a clear enough message.\n\n\"Closed\" is fine. Sorry for the digression.\n",
