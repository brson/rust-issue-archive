    "body": "If you keep track of the tasks that are blocked on acquiring a resource you can detect deadlocks even when they don't block the entire program. This would require the scheduler to somehow keep track of resources, but this could be cheap (it only needs sufficient information to construct a wait-for graph). There could be a low priority task that periodically constructs the graph and performs a cycle detection.\n\nEven if one is unwilling to pay the price of such a task, the wait-for graph could still be constructed by the scheduler when the 'all tasks are deadlocked' scenario occurs. Having an error message that describes the scenario could be really helpful with debugging.\n",

Rust programs were originally meant to use the crash-only software philosophy, where they would be designed to restart a failed task and recover.\n",
