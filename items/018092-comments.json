Interestingly it worked on the try branch just now, without any change. Both times it ran on bot `mac6`.\n\nI've added some more output to the LLDB script, so if it fails again, I should hopefully be able to find out what the actual problem was.\n",

    "body": "Alright! So the tests were actually executed two times, once on mac5 and once on mac6. On mac4 they have been ignored as they should be.\nI'm a little worried that testing got a bit less deterministic. In theory it may be possible that the tests are not run at all for a PR because testing only runs on machines where LLDB is too old. That could lead to a regression being introduced but showing up only later for PRs that don't have anything to do with the problem. We'll see if that becomes a problem in practice.\nThanks, Alex, for all the help with figuring out what to do with the build system! \n",
