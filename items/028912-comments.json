    "body": "`{ i8, i32, [8 x i8] }` is just the specific representation for the `L` variant. The type `H<i32, i64>` is represented as `%\"H<i32, i64>\" = type { i8, [7 x i8], [1 x i64] }`, so its alignment is 8. And I think all our code deals with types rather than concrete variants when checking for alignment.\n\nWe could probably extend that to allow for better packing of constants in some cases, but I'm not sure whether that's worth the trouble.\n",
