    "body": "I don't know why we insist on providing `malloc` for interaction with C libraries when msdn explicitly states:\n\n> The malloc function has the disadvantage of being run-time dependent.\n\nI feel that if users want to do FFI with C libraries they are responsible for binding the appropriate allocation methods and ensuring they work correctly. Rust should not try to guarantee that the allocator it uses is compatible with non-Rust libraries when there are a plethora of incompatible allocators and even `malloc` itself is runtime dependent.\n",
