    "body": "The libs team discussed this during triage today and there was quite a bit of discussion and we didn't quite reach a conclusion. Some thoughts we had were:\n- It may not be the case that we want to literally compare `Thread` structures but rather perhaps an opaque `ThreadId`. This opaque structure could then have all the necessary traits implemented.\n- We weren't quite sure what the concrete use case was here. We could come up with some theoretical ideas, but we couldn't think of something we'd actually use it for in practice, so do you have something in mind for this?\n- This is closely entangled with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/29448, so we'll probably want to coordinate among those two.\n",
