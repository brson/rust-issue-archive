It's not the best but it gets the job done. But I do believe that in this case, having a combined extension trait is the right thing to do (given that the only role is to provide a blanket impl for `T: Buffer`).\n\nI think it's fine to put the new trait(s) in the prelude as well (and `BytesReader` probably should have been.) We'll be more thoroughly evaluating criteria for prelude inclusion later this month.\n\nOtherwise, @huonw feel free to r+ when the above and your concerns have been addressed.\n\nThanks for the PR!\n",
