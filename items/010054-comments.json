    "body": "Looks great. Can you replace more of the event loops in `rt::sched` tests with the `BasicLoop` since these tests don't depend on I/O?\n\nMy only reservation is that this exposes a condition variable via `Exclusive`, making it more than just a mutex. As long as we consider `unstable::sync` to be runtime implementation details then like, whatever. I can't really pinpoint what rubs me the wrong way about this though. Still, convert some of the tests and r=me.\n",

    "body": "I replaced `run_in_newsched_task` to use `BasicLoop` by default, and then I went through libstd and updated all necessary locations to use a new `run_in_uv_task` instead if they needed I/O services. The most unfortunate migrations were for task spawning, which requires making an empty hash set, using the task's RNG, using the OS's rng, requiring I/O services.\n\nThis would probably get alleviated if we start implementing \"graceful fallback\" onto native thread-blocking implementations, but that can probably happen later.\n\nr? @brson on this strategy (just to make sure I'm sane)\n",
