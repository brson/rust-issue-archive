    "body": "If I were to design the API from the ground up at this moment, I would tend to say the the shorter-named `env` function would be used for building up the environment rather than overriding it. Overriding is a pretty dangerous thing to do as you have to ensure you keep all the important variables.\n\nCargo has a similar builder for the environment (predates `Command`), which has this signature:\n\n``` rust\npub fn env(mut self, key: &str, val: Option<&str>) -> ProcessBuilder;\n```\n\nFor us `&str` would be `T`, but it made it such that we didn't need to have two functions, one for insertion, and one for removal. That being said, I find `env(\"foo\", \"bar\")` quite convenient!\n\nHm, putting on the bikeshedding hat, what do you think of:\n\n``` rust\nfn env<T: ToCStr>(self, k: T, v: T) -> Self;\nfn env_remove<T: ToCStr>(self, k: T) -> Self;\nfn env_override<T: ToCStr>(self, k: &[(T, T)]) -> Self;\n```\n\nOther than the naming (which may also be just fine), the rest of the patch looks good to me!\n",
