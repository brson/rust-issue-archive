    "body": "This is also a bit surprising to me, but I searched the issue tracker and found #25564. So, it is a known problem and won't be fixed.\n\nOn the other hand, according to [the reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference.html#number-literals), number literals do _not_ start with minus signs in the first place. The minus sign in `-123.abs()` will never be a part of the number literal, so it will always be parsed just like `-x.abs()` would. In this aspect, `-x.abs()` being `-(x.abs())` seems quite intuitive to me.\n\nThat said, some lint that warns the user if he or she doesn't wrap the confusing expression with parentheses might be useful in this case.\n",
