The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pcwalton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

As we wanted everything to be homogeneous, even the native host is considered as being cross-compiled.\n\nTo achieve that, all of our toolchain binaries are prefixed with the architecture they target.\n\nthis means that binaries such as \"cc\" or \"ar\" don't exist at all. \"x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-cc\" and friends exist though.\n\nMaking these defaults configurable at build time would really help (and every language we packages so far allowed to do that)\n\nThe env var way was just the simplest solution I came with, but I'm all ears if something better could be done. As for the env method, I'm totally ok not to use CC and AR directly but some other env variables which only aim is that.\n",

    "body": "Note that you probably don't need to configure `ar` at all as LLVM already has a cross-platform-aware implementation which we use, so the only thing which needs configuring here is the linker. This can already be modified via the `-C linker` flag to the compiler or via [Cargo configuration](http://doc.crates.io/config.html).\n\nOne of the problems with something like `CC` for Rust code is that it's not always cross compiled that frequently. Most Cargo builds nowadays end up having a build script somewhere in the dependency tree (dealing with a native library or code generation) which needs to be compiled for the host platform, not the target platform, meaning that the value of `CC` would be wrong. This is why in Cargo you specify the linker per platform rather than a global linker.\n",

One of the differences between `rustc` and `gcc` is that the Rust compiler is more likely to be a cross compiler than any old build of `gcc`. For example all Rust compilers can target any platform, whereas (to the best of my knowledge) `gcc` generally targets only one or two platforms at a time. This means that a compile-time decision about the \"default linker\" isn't actually quite right because the compiler could be used to target any number of platforms.\n\n> For now, we have some dirty sed in the package, while we try to stay as vanilla as possible. That's why I'm trying to do something upstream here.\n\nI totally agree! Just trying to get a handle on what's going on here!\n\n> What would you suggest?

If you're using the standard triples, though, it looks like we're gonna need a solution that looks something along the lines of this.\n",
