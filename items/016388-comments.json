    "body": "I've moved the error message reporting into it's own function. The code is using `Local::try_unsafe_borrow` now so it doesn't change the `Task` object anymore.\n\nThe failure of `out-of-stack-no-split.rs` on Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 is not introduced by this patch so I have added Linux on the ignore list there. It turns out that the main thread stack is allocated to 74 TB when executed by with `make check` (the test passes when run manually). This leads to the OOM killer killing the process for `out-of-stack-no-split.rs` and leading to a test failure. This does not happen on Arch Linux x86_64 and Debian Jessie x86_64.\n",
