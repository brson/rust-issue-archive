    "body": "Thanks for doing all this porting work! I really appreciate it.\n\nThe first change is fine.\n\nAfter staring at this for a while I think I finally understand the problem the second change is solving (replacing -I with -iquote). Instead of doing it inline with the build command can we perform the substitution when we define `LLVM_CXXFLAGS_*`? Also please add your comment on why we are doing this to the source code so that the next person to encounter this can understand what is going on.\n\nAdditionally, I would prefer that the commit that just fixes indentation be combined with the previous one.\n",
