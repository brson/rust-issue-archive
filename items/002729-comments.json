    "body": "@brson points out I was too hasty to close this. Concerning followup points:\n- I agree that we should move to separate repos that we manage with cargo (or, um, `rust get` or whatever we wind up calling it).\n- I doubt we can get to a point where `rustc` does not depend on `std`, nor even sure that's desirable, but that's not an argument for them to always be maintained in a single repo. They are now, that's all. They can drift to separate repos once things settle down more.\n- I do think \"so it can keep compiling\" is a valid reason to have mozilla maintain something. Or more generally: \"so it gets QA attention as part of the language-development effort mozilla is funding\". Keeping something in one of our repos is exactly a signal/commitment to that sort of support.\n\nI'll change this to a tracking bug on ... making the standard library meet the note-wanted-libraries list, say?\n",

I'm not considering so much the actual decomposition of the standard library, whether it's one big crate or lots of little crates. In either scenario I would expect that all of the goodies that compose a rich standard library would be installed by default, by cargo.\n",
