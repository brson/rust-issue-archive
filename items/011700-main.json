  "body": "To build for the cortex-M series ARM processors LLC needs to be told to build for the thumb instruction set. There are two ways to do this, either with the triple \"thumb*-*-*\" or with -march=thumb (which just overrides the triple anyway). I chose the first way.\n\nThe following will fail because the local cc doesn't know what to do with -mthumb.\n\n```\nrustc test.rs --lib --target thumb-linux-eab\nerror: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1\nnote: cc: error: unrecognized command line option \u2018-mthumb\u2019\n```\n\nChanging the linker works as expected.\n\n```\nrustc test.rs --lib --target thumb-linux-eabi --linker arm-none-eabi-gcc\n```\n\nIdeally I'd have the triple thumb-none-eabi, but adding a new OS looks like much more work (and I'm not familiar enough with what it does to know if it is needed).\n",
