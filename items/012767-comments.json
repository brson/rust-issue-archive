    "body": "Thanks for linking to the mailing list discussion alexcrichton. It seems like most people on the mailing list think that a blocking bounded synchronous channel with a tunable buffer size is the way to go and that most of the discussion is quibbling over naming.\n\nOne issue that I don't think has been raised is that blocking writes will require an ability to select among writes and reads as is done in my sample applications.\n\nalexcrichton, you've done a lot of work on the scheduling right? Would altering the select interface so that one can wait on writeable channels be painful?\n",
