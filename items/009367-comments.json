    "body": "I was doing some testing with this recently, and here's all the troubles I ran into:\n- We'd have to have a submodule for clang, compiler-rt, and lld (not that bad)\n- It looks like lld will only build with cmake (we'd have to introduce this dependency)\n- I could not get compiler-rt when not using cmake (it hit a build error)\n- I could not get compiler-rt to build when using cmake (`find . -name '*compiler-rt*'` came up with nothing interesting)\n- I could not get `lld` to link a hello-world binary on darwin (lots of complaints about undefined symbols)\n- I could build `libcxxabi` from LLVM on osx/linux, but it would probably require that we build clang as well. It requires a fairly new C++ compiler (above llvm 3.2 I think?) and some distros are still lagging behind on 3.0 as the official clang version. OSX has a new-enough clang by default, and it appears that freebsd does as well, so we could perhaps do some easy version detection to figure out whether we need to build clang or not.\n- On OSX, we can build libunwind out of the folder in libcxxabi (yay!)\n- On linux, it looks like we may be able to rely on libgcc_eh.a for `_Unwind_Resume` and friends\n\nI have done little testing on windows, but I believe that the story will be very similar except for figuring out where `_Unwind_Resume` comes from. I'm also probably just not doing anything correctly, but right now I'm having a hard time of figuring out what...\n",

    "body": "I briefly explored getting rustc built with LLD today, but found the current linker situation complicated enough to discourage me from further work. In summary:\n- In all cases except msvc:\n  - rustc uses `cc` or `gcc` with `-Wl` to link stuff. This uses `ld` under the hood.\n- In the MSVC case:\n  - rustc uses `link.exe` to link stuff, and this logic lives in a parallel universe from everything else.\n\nNote that LLD intentionally implements several command-line interfaces, designed to emulate `clang`, `gcc`, and `link.exe`. These are selected with the `-flavor` flag. This means that moving to LLD can greatly simplify MSVC support and bring it inline with the other platforms.\n\nThere's a final snag:\n- LLVM is migrating to `cmake`. The \"old\" build system is deprecated, but still present.\n- rustc builds LLVM using the \"old\" build system (except in the msvc case).\n- LLD fails to build using LLVM's \"old\" build system.\n\nThis means that in order to use LLD, rustc must depend on `cmake`.\n\nIf anyone is interested in picking up this torch (maybe @alexcrichton or @alexchandel?), see https://github.com/tamird/rust/tree/use-lld.\n",

However, running the binary generates a new segfault.\n\n---\n\nOther interesting bit is that `rustc -g` produces an object file that `lld` can't use:\n\n```\n$ rustc -g -C linker=/usr/bin/false hello.rs\n$ lld -flavor gnu hello.0.o -o hello\nSHF_MERGE section size must be a multiple of sh_entsize\n$ echo $?\n1\n```\n\n---\n\n### Version\n\n```\nLLVM Linker Version: 3.9(/var/cache/paludis/distfiles/scm/lld e5f40891704022e82687c317c814377a485d73ba)\n```\n\nCan anyone reproduce these errors? Or perhaps someone can point out a fatal error I may have committed in the above steps?\n",

It'd be a pity to only be able to link mach-o and windows binaries.\n\nFWIW, by having a shell script called `link.exe` that adds the `./lib` folder of `~/i686-pc-windows-msvc` (itself a union of ~/i686-pc-windows-msvc-vc6 and ~/i686-pc-windows-msvc-w10) to the `LIB` env variable and then calls `lld-link`, (and doing a similar thing for `cl.exe` for projects with a `build.rs`,) I can cross-compile basically any Rust project to windows.\n",

    "body": "@tamird I think `lld` works in your case because you are using the `mach-o` backend (macos) instead of the `elf` backend (linux). I tried your scripts, I had to modify them to run on Linux, but `lld` is not being used at all. I think it's because `rustc` uses `cc` as a linker, `cc` calls `collect2` (instead of `ld`) with all the linker arguments and `collect2` then calls a prefixed `ld` (i.e. `/usr/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-ld`) on my system. Maybe `collect2` is ignoring the `-B .` flag used in your script?\n\nAnyhow, I intended to add a `-Z use-lld` flag to `rustc` that forced the compiler to use `lld` as a linker as a way to start testing integration with `lld` but without a way to test locally I won't be able to. If anyone want to give that idea a try I can provide some pointers.\n",

I wonder how microsoft got it so wrong, while apple got it so right; their entry point (and crt initialization i.e. `crt1.o`) is literally inside `libSystem.dylib`.\n\n@nagisa They've finished [rewriting](http://blog.llvm.org/2015/11/new-elf-linker-from-llvm-project.html) and are working on feature parity now.\n",

    "body": "@alexchandel How is that Microsoft getting it wrong? Is there a reason that statically linking the entry point might be a bad idea? On Windows every binary (exe or dll) has an entry point which is responsible for initializing all the statics and such in that binary. If you're using C/C++ in a given binary, then you need the CRT entry point. Since Rust doesn't have runtime static initializers, or any life outside of main for that matter, as long as you don't call certain CRT functions (such as `atexit` whose tables are module local!) then a pure Rust binary would have no need for the CRT entry point and could have its own minimal entry point. C/C++ code that is in DLLs, since they have their own entry points, they'll continue to work fine. If you link the CRT _statically_ then you definitely need the CRT entry point since that brings in C/C++ with a bunch of statics and stuff directly into your binary and thus it needs to be initialized correctly.\n\nWhether we link to msvcrt via generated idata or an import library is rather irrelevant to whether we skip the CRT entry point. As long as the CRT is dynamically linked and we don't have any statically linked C/C++ then we can skip the CRT entry point. Note that generating idata instead of linking to an import library is a move that needs to be considered very carefully. Imagine if we generated idata to some of the math functions and someone statically linked in some C/C++ code that calls those math functions and checks the result via `errno`. If it pulls in the math functions from the generated idata, but the `errno` from an import library, then they could very well end up being _different_ CRTs and things would fail horribly. Also consider the case of someone trying to use Rust to make a UWP app instead of a regular desktop app. They need to link to `onecore.lib` _instead_ of things like `kernel32.lib` so references can resolve to different DLLs. If libstd decides to generate idata for some of the system functions it uses it could end up generating them for the _wrong_ DLL and things would fail horribly.\n",

    "body": "@retep998 There's more than just the entry point and static initializers in there, and the versioned `vcruntime140.dll` that the UCRT requires dynamically linked binaries to link has all kinds of stuff, including of exception handling, dispatch, and unwinding. Yet everything that Microsoft here claims must change between compiler versions, OSX has kept permanently stable since the introduction of libSystem by keeping it behind the libSystem facade. That's getting it wrong vs right. Rust executables on OS X, even those statically linked with C/C++ code, don't need anything other than a dynamic link to libSystem.dylib.\n\nIt sounds like Rust would have to reason whether any import libraries were included when deciding to generate idata. But in the case where C/C++ code is statically linked, a use case I often deal with on Windows, is it then necessary to use import libraries from a Windows toolchain?\n",
