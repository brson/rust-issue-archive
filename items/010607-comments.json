In this case, I'm guessing that you wouldn't really want a local stack frame with 5K variables, though you might be checking to make sure that they all get optimized away.

    "body": "I was thinking of Clinger and Rees [\"Macros that Work\"](http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/), but its been a while since I looked at either carefully, maybe Dybvig [\"Syntactic Abstraction in Scheme\"](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/LaSC-5-4-pp295-326.pdf) is the better reference to use at this point.\n\nmy memory is that the differences between the papers are most relevant when you start having procedural macros.  Rust's macros are still much like Scheme's `syntax-rules`, and so I hypothesize that one could start from either document and get useful info for attacking this problem.\n\n(If nothing else, at least these links are not behind a paywall.)\n",
