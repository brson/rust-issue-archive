    "body": "I believe that those examples were written long before the actual code was written, and it's a bit unfortunate that the actual code to perform such a simple operation is so verbose.\n\nThe runtime is still very much in flux, and I'd rather not commit to this becoming \"the example\" for making an HTTP request. I think that there are a few ways that this could become smaller again though:\n- There is actually a `read_to_end` on the `ReaderUtil` trait in `std::rt::io::extensions`\n- I don't think that this example needs to go through the rigamarole of decoding the string as utf8\n\nRight now the priority effort is to remove `std::io` completely, but it is very tightly rooted in many portions of the compiler. For now we're still dealing with the string-related apis of the new runtime because it's not clear how different encodings will be handled (and they certainly should be). I would hold off on writing new *Util traits for now.\n",

    "body": "I definitely agree that we need more code examples, but now may not be the best time to write code examples for `std::rt::io` because it's still not a concrete vision to the finish line of what the apis are going to look like.\n\nThat being said, we're always more than happy to get some help! If you want to help axe std::io, that would be incredibly helpful. One of the major consumers is `extra::json`, and I've got an in-flight patch with an attempt to remove it. It turns out that it was incredibly deeply rooted throughout many many modules and I'm having a difficult time removing it all the way. I'm sure there's plenty of tendrils of std::io in many other locations, however, and removal of any of them would be really helpful!\n",
