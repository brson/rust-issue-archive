  "body": "Dear Rust Developers\n\nThis isn't so much a final pull request, as a way to ask for detailed assistance now that I've gotten to the point where I can't figure out how to get these final finishing touches on the func!() macro, which provides output somewhat similar to C99's **FUNC**, but also includes the file location because of anonymous functions (lambdas).\n\nThe current pull request provides a test file for the func!() functionaly. It is called rust/src/test/run-pass/syntax-extension-func.rs\n\n; it contains 8 tests. Currently only the first one passes, the others do not, hence they are commented out. Using func!() in a regular function seems to work. Yay!  But there are plenty of other kinds of functions that need to be trace-able too!\n\nThe part where I'm stuck is: how do I get the method names from traits, extensions, and lambdas?\n\nThanks!\n\nJason\n",
