    "body": "[According to @huonw](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26192564/rust-struct-can-borrow-a-mut-self-twice-so-why-cant-a-trait) and @BurntSushi, higher-rank lifetimes may be the easiest way to write some sort of zero-allocation `StreamingIterator` type, which has [big performance implications for parsing libraries](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2i6xry/can_i_write_zerocopy_parsers_with_iterator_it/). Right now, eliminating memory allocation can result in 25x\u201347x speedups, but there's no way to abstract over the necessary lifetimes required to make a useful generic trait.\n\nThe basic goal is to take a trait similar to the standard library's `Buffer`:\n\n``` rust\npub trait Buffer: Reader {\n    fn fill_buf<'a>(&'a mut self) -> IoResult<&'a [u8]>;\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n\u2026but which returns a generic value:\n\n``` rust\npub trait StreamingIterator<T<'*>> {\n    fn next<'a>(&'a mut self) -> Option<T<'a>>;\n\n    // Can we implement _any_ reasonable version of `fold` here? \n    fn fold<'a,S>(&'a mut self, init: B, f: |S, T<'a>| -> S) -> S { ... } \n}\n```\n\nThis would be a really nice use-case for Rust: It would allow performing high-speed generic computations on streaming I/O. Right now, we can pick any two of \"high-speed,\" \"generic\" and \"streaming,\" as far as I can tell. After several days of picking people's brains, it feels like we can _almost_ get all three, but it's just barely of reach.\n",
