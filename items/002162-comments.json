    "body": "I thought there was already an open bug on this but I couldn't find it.  I too have encountered this problem and I have two ideas for how to fix this:\n- The easiest is probably to create a separate output directory for each test that uses aux-build.  This seems good because it isolates the tests from one another.  It would also allow multiple tests to perform the same aux-build without any problem.\n- Alternatively, we could have a process tasked with performing aux-builds: each test task would send a message requesting that the aux-build be performed and then await the response.  The central task would then check whether the aux-build is not started / has already been done / is in progress / .  In the first case, it can spawn a task to perform the aux-build.  In the second case, it can respond immediately.  In the third case, it can add the test task to a \"notify list\" and wait until the ongoing compilation finishes.\n\nThe latter is more optimal for text execution time but seems rather more complex _and_ fails to isolate the tests, so I am leaning towards the former.\n",
