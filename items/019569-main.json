  "body": "This is a first pass at insert on RingBuf. I tried to keep it as simple as possible. I'm not sure of the performance implications of doing one copy vs. copying multiple times but moving a smaller amount of memory. I chose to stick with one copy, even if the amount of memory I have to move is larger.\n\nI believe this is part of #18424 \n\n@Gankro mentioned this was missing.\n",
