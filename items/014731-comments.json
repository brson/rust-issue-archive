As an example of what I am objecting to, see the various changes in the compile-fail tests, such as this here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/14731/files#diff-4\n\n(where of course it is an improvement that you tell the user that they need a tuple of nones; I just would prefer to see it printed as `(None, None)`, especially if `None` is in scope.)\n",

Based on what I saw, though, this seems quite nice, and I'm willing to r+ pending satisfaction of @pnkfelix and @edwardw's complaints. (That said, I personally am satisfied with the error messages as they are.)\n\nOne thing I would like to see is an expansion of the non-exhaustive-match tests. They seem fairly shallow. I'd like to see e.g. non-exhaustive-vectors embedded in enums and other strange things.\n",

Apologies for that!\n\n@nikomatsakis Right, I added one more test case with a few examples of nested destructuring. I agree that these parts of the compiler are not the easiest to navigate. I'll see if I can document some of it.\n\n@edwardw Right, I like that idea. Would you mind if I did this separately? It shouldn't be too hard to collect more than one witness but I need to think this through.\n",
