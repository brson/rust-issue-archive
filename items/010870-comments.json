    "body": "Special casing on an `arm` is a little too special-casing for me. This has nothing to do with arms of a match, but rather something which can show up in patterns.\n\nI believe the correct solution for this is in #10862 where a `visit_path` method was added. The real bug here is that paths in patterns aren't being matched, not that patterns in arms aren't being matched. For now, let's wait for the outcome of #10862 and then rebase this on top of that (and override `visit_path` in the visitor).\n\nI'd also be fine if you wanted to rebase that patch in this PR and I'll r+ this one as soon as that one gets r+'d (to get the rebase conflicts out of the way sooner).\n",
