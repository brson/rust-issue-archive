They'd be closures that own all the values in their environment (the environment being a unique pointer as well). They'd be more compatible with regular blocks (you could pass a fn~ to a function expecting a block), and for real bare functions the environment field can simply be a null pointer, so no extra malloc is required.\n",

Remove the \"type descriptors on the stack\" feature. Move the type descriptor store (used in `upcall_get_type_desc`) to a shared arena. Add locks around `upcall_get_type_desc`.\n3. Implement unique closures. When creating a type-parametric unique closure, copy the type descriptors into the exchange heap. (Note that this must be a recursive copy, because of derived tydescs. So it has to use the shape glue.)\n\nAll of these are painful. #2 is especially bad for performance, but it's probably the easiest to implement.\n\nIn any case, I think that sending is the nail in the coffin for type-passing.

Both solutions caused our binaries to grow enormously. #1 because of the sheer number of polymorphic calls in our code, #2 because of the size of the type descriptor store, despite our optimizations. Solution #2 considerably slowed down communication. Solution #1 was largely incompatible with separate compilation and caused surprising bugs (e.g. with mutable cells that were somehow monomorphized as a side-effect of the monomorphization of something else).\n\nI personally believe that #2 is the least fragile.
