  "body": "trivial r? for anyone who agrees with me.  :)\n\nGiven the choice between\n1. printing the set of files once on a single line,\n2. printing the set of files one per line, or \n3. printing the set twice, once in each manner,\n\nI originally chose (3.) since it seemed safest to be loud about this.  But now that I've used it for a bit, I think (1.) would suffice.\n",
