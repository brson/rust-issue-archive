    "body": "I'm not sure if it this is actually fixable. At best I think some more intelligence regarding error messages is possible, but it's due to the way we treat certain structures as statements instead of expressions. Specifically, \"block\" expressions (including `if` and similar) are treated as statements if they start an expression. Any \"fix\" here would be a massively breaking change.\n\nIt's easy to come up with cases like those, but when you split the lines up like so:\n\n``` rust\nif foo {\n    1\n} else {\n    2\n}\n*n\n```\n\nit becomes more obvious that \"fixing\" it isn't feasible. The only proper fix is to require that **all** statements be terminated with a semicolon. Since that isn't going to happen, we have to work with these edge cases.\n\nI'm not sure what we're supposed to do about this, it's the way Rust parses and can't be changed without breaking most code out there. I'm going to close this as not-a-bug, feel free to re-open if you disagree.\n",
