  "body": "r? @graydon\n\nThis branch removes most uses of oldcomm. It isn't quite ready but I've been at it for a while so I'm posting it for review. Removing the last few usages of oldcomm from std is proving to be time consuming because there's a lot of tricky unsafe code involved. This also won't be mergable until I figure out #4478.\n\nThe general strategy:\n- Fix #3760 so task spawning has sane behavior. These changes are going to add some more 'service' tasks that spawn lazily and they should not spawn onto random schedulers.\n- Add a general `at_exit` facility where the runtime will execute a closure just before shutdown.\n- Add a simple, unsafe 'global data' API. It is simply a way to access a global hash table under a mutex. Uses `at_exit` for cleanup.\n- Add a new weak task module that uses pipes, at_exit and global data\n- Convert users of the old weak task code and `chan_from_global_ptr` to the new interfaces\n- Remove the old weak task and `chan_from_global_ptr` functions\n- Remove oldcomm\n\nOrganizationally, this dumps all the new modules under `core::private`, which I recognize is not right. I intend to reorganize the runtime code as outlined in #2240.\n",
