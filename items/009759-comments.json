    "body": "There is an existing bug hit by `UnsafeArc` with this change. The bug is already around if the type is changed to being a newtype struct, so I don't think it should block this.\n\nI've investigated it quite thoroughly but still haven't determined where the cleanup cancelling for immediates goes wrong. By removing the annotation stripping the drop flag, the type becomes 2 words and is no longer immediate.\n",
