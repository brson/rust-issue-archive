    "body": "This implementation returns `Some(1)` for Ambiguous characters.\n\n[UAX#11](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/), \u00a75, makes recommendations for three situations.\n1. _When mapping Unicode to East Asian legacy character encodings_\n   - treat 'A' width as fullwidth (2 column) characters\n2. _When mapping Unicode to non-East Asian legacy character encodings_\n   - treat 'A' width as narrow (1 column) characters\n3. _When processing or displaying data_\n   - treat 'A' width based on the present context, or, if the context cannot be reliably determined, treat 'A' width as narrow.\n\nCase 3 seems the closest to our purposes in providing such a function in the standard library, and case 1 the furthest. Absent explicit locale support, it seems to me that treating 'A' as narrow is the correct decision.\n\nThis behavior is also consistent with the notes in [Markus Kuhn's implementation](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c). Above the alternate `mk_wcwidth_cjk()` function, he says:\n\n```\n * The following functions are the same as mk_wcwidth() and\n * mk_wcswidth(), except that spacing characters in the East Asian\n * Ambiguous (A) category as defined in Unicode Technical Report #11\n * have a column width of 2. This variant might be useful for users of\n * CJK legacy encodings who want to migrate to UCS without changing\n * the traditional terminal character-width behaviour. It is not\n * otherwise recommended for general use.\n```\n\nWe could provide an alternate function, e.g., `width_cjk()`, which returns an appropriate value for CJK locales; then it is up to the programmer to choose the correct width based on her locale. If this seems desirable, I can add another table and corresponding function to the `charwidth` module.\n",

    "body": "I'm a little worried about adding more and more unicode-ness into libcore, especially when you think of libcore being the core of all rust code in existence. It seems a little odd to put `char.width()` on the same level as `slice.len()`.\n\nThat being said, this definitely seems like a useful property to have, and it should likely have a home somewhere. Additionally, there's already a bunch of other unicode stuff in libcore anyway right now so this may not be that far off from home?\n\nI suppose I'm a little uneasy about functionality like this going into libcore, and I would be more comfortable with it going elsewhere, but I'd have to think about where that elsewhere should be.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I gave some thought to how we would disentangle Unicode from libcore, and while I believe it is doable, I have become convinced that doing it right now, piecemeal, is the wrong approach.\n- At the moment, libcore is a bit of a sprawl---26MB on my machine!---and I'd be surprised if the Unicode tables account for even 0.1% of that.\n  - For example, the charwidths table has about 500 entries at 10 bytes per entry.\n- As a result, moving Unicode-related Char functionality out of libcore will, by itself, have almost no impact on the size of libcore.\n- Thus, if we want to clean up libcore, other cleanup will need to happen as well.\n  - Given the present size of libcore, my feeling is that this will be a major effort driven by hard data: how much does each feature in libcore cost, and how easy is it to move that feature into a non-core library?\n    - This will almost certainly be a breaking change, and thus needs to happen before 1.0.\n  - The rudimentary Unicode support presently in libcore is, in my mind, unlikely to be even in the top 10 submodules in terms of how much it adds to libcore's size.\n    - So excising it from libcore does almost nothing to address the primary concern.\n    - ...and it probably doesn't have much benefit in terms of reducing future work slimming down libcore.\n\nRecognizing the oft-quoted anatomical counterpart to opinions, I nevertheless submit to you that the project of trimming libcore is probably a full RFC and accompanying discussion in its own right, and that---especially since almost all of the code in this PR is autogenerated by unicode.py---adding this functionality to libcore as it stands now is in no way detrimental to future efforts in that vein.\n\nToward the goal of slimming libcore, I am certainly willing to undertake some experimentation in terms of contributors to total library size. Once we have that data, perhaps an open discussion (in an issue? an RFC?) on libcore structure will be fruitful.\n",

    "body": "OK, new crate is called libunicode.\n\nI moved most of the functions in the Char trait in libcore to the UnicodeChar trait.\n- `is_alphabetic`\n- `is_XID_start`\n- `is_XID_continue`\n- `is_lowercase`\n- `is_uppercase`\n- `is_whitespace`\n- `is_alphanumeric`\n- `is_control`\n- `is_digit`\n- `to_lowercase`\n- `to_uppercase`\n- `width`\n\nI left the following functions in libcore:\n- `is_digit_radix` - this is not a Unicode-aware function\n- `to_digit` - ditto\n- `from_digit` - ditto\n- `escape_unicode` - I hesitated on this one, but it's not really aware of anything beyond the particular escape sequences we use to represent the `char` datatype, so I thought it should stay here.\n- `escape_default` - if the above stays, certainly this one does too\n- `len_utf8_bytes` - low-level representation--related\n- `encode_utf8` - ditto\n- `encode_utf16` - ditto\n\nI also moved some of the `StrSlice` methods into `UnicodeStrSlice`, specifically, the ones that rely on methods provided by `UnicodeChar`:\n- `words`\n- `is_whitespace`\n- `is_alphanumeric`\n- `trim`\n- `trim_left`\n- `trim_right`\n- the `Words` type alias is also in libunicode, since it is the return type for `words`. Strictly speaking, this _could_ stay in `StrSlice`, but I don't see the point, really. Nothing below libstd uses it anyway.\n\nFinally, the unicode modules from libcollections and libcore are now consolidated in the tables module under libunicode. libcollections was using libcore's unicode support anyway, so there was really no sense in keeping the two separate.\n\nI added `UnicodeStrSlice` and `UnicodeChar` to the prelude, and I changed libstd so that it re-exports the `char` module from libunicode rather than from libcore (and libunicode re-exports the public elements of libcore so that this is seamless). libcollections provides std::str as before, with a few elements re-exported from libunicode.\n\nFor things above libstd, this change should be completely seamless, except that there are two new traits, UnicodeStrSlice and UnicodeChar, which provide some of the functionality previously provided by Char and StrSlice. Since `char` and `&str` are the only implementors of these traits (respectively) this should be a no-op for almost everyone.\n",

The commit log will need some revisiting before merging, and when doing so remember to put [`[breaking-change]`](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-April/009543.html) where appropriate.\n\n@aturon, @brson, do either of you have thoughts on this split? I like this for a few reasons:\n- Adding new unicode functionality has a clear location at which it should be added `libunicode`\n- There's a clear split between what needs unicode and what doesn't.\n- All unicode modules scattered across our crates are now consolidated into one.\n- All usage of the `unicode` crate itself is `#[experimental]` (as it should be, unless it's reexported)\n- I believe that rustdoc does a good enough job with inlining/presentation that this won't degrade the quality of documentation too much.\n\nSome downsides which I could think of:\n- The privileged name `libunicode` is taken. I believe this to be ok because as part of the facade we're at liberty to rename things as we see fit.\n- Common functions like `is_whitespace` are harder to access if you're only using libcore. I think this isn't so bad.\n",

    "body": "On this. libcollections tests use some methods that are in UnicodeChar, and I guess they don't run on check-stage1? Fix should be quick, but I'll re-run locally to be sure that I didn't miss any.\n\nWell this is odd. The test module that failed imports std::prelude::*, so it should certainly have the UnicodeChar trait imported. Perhaps this is a globbing issue? (Still compiling...)\n\nShould be good to go now, I hope...\n",

    "body": "How annoying. The test case should have failed, because the PERLW table now includes that character (in accordance with UTS#18, and perl agrees), but I'm confused why that test didn't run when I ran tests locally before the last commit.\n\nAnyway, updated the test to a character that is definitely not in the \\w character class (verified against perl). Apologies for the waste of time and resources. I'll check in once tests finish on my end.\n\nAha! Found it. Combination of turning off ipv6 in the kernel (making libstd tests fail) and running check with -j4 (making the failure non-obvious in the output file, because other tests kept running afterward). Shouldn't be an issue in the future, one hopes.\n",
