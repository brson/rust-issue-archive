  "body": "This detects cases where a struct or enum are annotated with `#[repr(C)]`,\nand _do not_ have `#[unsafe_no_drop_flag]`, whereby it warns the user that\nthe type may not have the expected size or layout.\n\nThe lint was set to \"Warn\" by default as I wasn't sure if \"Deny\" would be too strong.\n\nA tangential change was to remove `#[repr(C)]` from `Cleanup` in `src/libstd/sys/windows/backtrace.rs`.  I believe this to be justified in that `Cleanup` is only ever used exactly once as an RAII handle, and is never passed to any FFI function.\n\nTwo tests including to ensure the lint triggers when `#[unsafe_no_drop_flag]` is missing, and does not trigger if it is present.\n\nAddresses rust-lang/rust#18380.\n",
