  "body": "This commit aims to stabilize the `std::hash` module by standardizing on its\nhashing interface while rationalizing the current usage with the `HashMap` and\n`HashSet` types. The primary goal of this slight redesign is to separate the\nconcepts of a hasher's state from a hashing algorithm itself.\n\nThe primary change of this commit is to separate the `Hasher` trait into a\n`Hasher` and a `HashState` trait. Conceptually the old `Hasher` trait was\nactually just a factory for various states, but hashing had very little control\nover how these states were used. Additionally the old `Hasher` trait was\nactually fairly unrelated to hashing.\n\nThis commit redesigns the existing `Hasher` trait to match what the notion of a\n`Hasher` normally implies with the following definition:\n\n```\ntrait Hasher: Writer {\n    type Output;\n\n    fn reset(&mut self);\n    fn finish(&self) -> Output;\n}\n```\n\nNote that the `Output` associated type is currently a type parameter due to\nassociated types not being fully implemented yet. This new `Hasher` trait\nemphasizes that all hashers are sinks for bytes, and hashing algorithms may\nproduce outputs other than a `u64`, so a the output type is made generic.\n\nWith this definition, the old `Hasher` trait is realized as a new `HashState`\ntrait in the `collections::hash_state` module as an experimental addition for\nnow. The current definition looks like:\n\n```\ntrait HashState {\n    type H: Hasher;\n    fn hasher(&self) -> H;\n}\n```\n\nNote that the `H` associated type (along with its `O` output) are both type\nparameters on the `HashState` trait due to the current limitations of associated\ntypes. The purpose of this trait is to emphasize that the one piece of\nfunctionality for implementors is that new instances of `Hasher` can be created.\nThis conceptually represents the two keys from which more instances of a\n`SipHasher` can be created, and a `HashState` is what's stored in a `HashMap`,\nnot a `Hasher`.\n\nImplementors of custom hash algorithms should implement the `Hasher` trait, and\nonly hash algorithms intended for use in hash maps need to implement or worry\nabout the `HashState` trait.\n\nSome other stability decision made for the `std::hash` module are:\n- The name of the module, hash, is `#![stable]`\n- The `Hash` and `Hasher` traits are `#[unstable]` due to type parameters that\n  want to be associated types.\n- The `Writer` trait remains `#[experimental]` as it's intended to be replaced\n  with an `io::Writer` (more details soon).\n- The top-level `hash` function is `#[unstable]` as it is intended to be generic\n  over the hashing algorithm instead of hardwired to `SipHasher`\n- The inner `sip` module is now private as its one export, `SipHasher` is\n  reexported in the `hash` module.\n\nThere are many breaking changes outlined above, and as a result this commit is\na:\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
