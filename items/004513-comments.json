    "body": "@yichoi I pushed a cleanup commit to my cross2 branch that deletes a bunch of code to make further changes easier: https://github.com/brson/rust/commit/abb5c65aa035301b24af56256f70f636a7974152\n\nI'm going to do a little more cleanup to my [cross2](https://github.com/brson/rust/tree/cross2) branch to make sure it works like I think it does (I'm testing e.g. `configure --host-triples=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --target-triples=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu,i686-unknown-linuxgnu` with the intent that we build cross-compiled libraries, _but not a cross-compiled compiler_, for the non-host-triple target-triples. I'd like to know what you think about this approach. It might be best if you take over this work since you are more familiar with what exactly we need to do for Android.\n\nI have some examples below of how I imagine the configuration should work and the directory structure it should produce.\n\nIn the makefiles on cross2 ''host' platforms are those for which we build ompilers; 'target' platforms are the platforms are the ones the 'host' compilers target.\n\nAs an example, in a scenario where `CFG_HOST_TRIPLES=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `CFG_TARGET_TRIPLES=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu arm-unknown-android` I would expect to see final directory output like:\n\n```\nx86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/\n  bin/\n    - x86_64 compiler, etc.\n  lib/\n    - x86_64 libs\n    rustc/\n      x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/\n      arm-unknown-android/\n        bin/\n          - no contents here since all our binaries depend on librustc and we won't be building a rustc to run on arm\n        lib/\n          librt\n          libcore\n          libstd      \n```\n\nIn an even more complex scenario where we are building the entire compiler for multiple architectures (as indicated by multiple host triples) we would expect the following output (and the current build does this sort of thing already).\n\n```\nx86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/\n  - as above\ni686-unknown-linux-gnu/\n  bin/\n  lib/\n    rustc/\n      x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/\n      arm-unknown-android/\n        bin/\n          - no contents here since all our binaries depend on librustc and we won't be building a rustc to run on arm\n        lib/\n          librt\n          libcore\n          libstd\n```\n\nSome next steps (I'll leave these to you if you like):\n- Each target triple needs to have it's own variables for controlling the C++ toolchain. A lot of this is defined in platform.mk\n- The configure script needs a flag like `--enable-android-ndk=${path}` to configure the above\n- rustc's linking logic in `rustc::back::link` will need to be modified. This code tends to be fairly platform-specific, but since the NDK uses gcc we may be able to get away with a simple change to specify which instance of gcc rustc should call to do the linking, maybe with a flag like `--cc-name`. If that isn't sufficient we may need to teach rustc about the android NDK itself, adding an `--android-ndk-path=` or similar. Perhaps this has been added already and just needs to be wired up to the makefiles.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis asked on IRC why we don't just build the compiler for ARM. That would allow us to leave the build as it is. I had a strong belief that one wouldn't usually want a compiler to run _on_ ARM, but that may not be true. It could be simpler to build compilers everywhere.\n\nAs an alternative to making this distinction between 'host' and 'target', which effectively just changes which binaries are built, we could teach the configure script to disable components or groups of components per target, and disable the ARM compiler by default.\n",

Instead I think it makes sense to parametrize more of the compiler variables over the target triples (like much of the other code in the makefiles). Essentially, the `MAKE_CC` macro should be more like your `MAKE_CC2` macro, allowing each target to have its own compiler. I realize this is a big change.\n",

I'm thinking of paramaterizing all the toolchain-related variables over the target triple - basically removing the few variables that use `HOST_$(target)` and making most everything in `platform.mk` target-specific. The end result should be that the ARM cross should be more similar to the x86_64->i686, etc. cross. I'm going to do some hacking on it this weekend, maybe try to do the ARM build myself, using your branch, so I understand exactly how it is supposed to work.\n\nMy current branch: https://github.com/brson/rust/tree/cross4\n",

    "body": "@yichoi I am truly sorry I keep stepping on your toes here. Our patches are indeed quite similar.\n\nI like the way you handled [platform.mk](https://github.com/yichoi/rust/commit/26a5dc593c1895b4dd9a024ef785cb3682cb064a#L4R54), just writing out the variable names like `CFG_INSTALL_NAME_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. I'm so used to putting `$(1)`s everywhere that I didn't even consider that. The one thing I don't like so much is the way it names the compiler by prefixing the `CFG_GCCISH_CROSS` variable, vs. defining `CC_$(triple)`, etc. in mine - it seems to be specific to android by expecting compilers to be named `$prefix-gcc`.\n\nIt also doesn't create a per-triple `X` variable for naming executable extensions, but honestly that's probably not a major problem at the moment since nobody is going to be cross compiling from windows to android. Some people do have a desire to cross-compile from linux to windows (wine) though. I think that is beside the point for the android cross though so not a major problem if we don't do that, and it may actually be preferable not to do that now to avoid the extra complexity.\n\nI'm going to run your branch through the try bots today and see what they think. Perhaps you can let me know how you think we should proceed from here.\n\n@sanxiyn Changing the triple sounds fine to me. Does LLVM accept either?\n",
