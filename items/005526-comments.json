There are some differences in path handling between Cygwin and MSYS that may trip up Rust's build system, I'm not sure. It would be interesting to find out what breaks though. You might just end up needing to add `cygpath -w` before some paths, since Cygwin doesn't do the automatic translation from posix-style paths to Windows-style that MSYS does, and MinGW-compiled executables don't understand Cygwin absolute paths.\n",
