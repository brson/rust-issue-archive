I'm not sure @alexcrichton was aware of this bad behavior when he set the lint to default to allow...)\n\n((my initial idea above was dumb: Its doubtlessly _by design_ that statics can appear as constants in patterns.  The issue is that they are easily mistaken for binding identifiers.  So the lint could instead warn about lowercase static constants that are occurring as pattern bindings; its again a refinement of the aforementioned non-uppercase-statics lint, but one that we can probably stand behind turning on by default.))\n",

    "body": "This is pretty close to being closeable now that PR #9638 has landed.  The main thing left would be to improve the error message for the \"refutable pattern error\" (sic) to point at the span for the static that is causing the rebinding attempt to fail.\n\n(I wrote \"(sic)\" above because I'm pretty sure we should be saying that only _irrefutable_ patterns are allowed in e.g. `let x = 3;`, based on my understanding of what the words \"refutable\" and \"irrefutable\" mean.  A \"refutable\" pattern is one that could be proven false, which I take to mean \"one that is allowed to fail to match up\", and an \"irrefutable pattern\" would be one that _cannot_ fail to match, which sounds like the kind of pattern that fits with `let PAT = EXPR`.)\n",
