    "body": "I understood his comment as saying that typestate won't be eliminated when it comes to checking definite-assignment, but that the question of whether typestate predicates with arbitrary user-defined functions will be eliminated or not is still open. Of course, I may have misunderstood...\n\nNo, I don't know of anyplace where the upsides/downsides of removing them are documented. As far as I know (but I wasn't here from the beginning, so I may have missed some stuff), `pure` annotations have always been around as a somewhat unfortunate requirement for typestate (since inferring purity in general is undecidable, and inferring a conservative subset of pure functions would lead to unpredictable results). While they might, unintentionally, have other purposes (like documentation), that wasn't the intent of adding them to the language.\n",
