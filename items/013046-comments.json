    "body": "I agree with this. I think that this was just missed when default functions were added, because before default functions, it would be impossible to **ever** automatically pull in an inheriting trait.\n\nNow that default functions exist, it is possible to create a trait that has **only** default functions, and then inherit from that trait. If the struct that is implementing the \"child\" trait is happy with the defaults in the \"parent\", there is no reason to require an empty `impl` of the parent.\n\nAllowing a struct to omit the empty impl also allows traits to add new inherited functionality without breaking clients if the inherited functionality comes in the form of a trait with no unimplemented functions.\n",

    "body": "> how would your example work? Doesn't trait Foo : TotalEq mean that implementors of Foo are required to implement TotalEq?\n\nYes, exactly, `ShouldntBeTotalEq` doesn't and shouldn't implement `TotalEq` (assume that it contains some floats or something, and so has a non-total `Eq` implementation). The example is supposed to not compile. (And correctly doesn't compile today.)\n\nWith the changes mentioned in https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/13046#issuecomment-38233602 (i.e. making `TotalEq` just an assertion about the `Eq` impl of a type, no methods) and this one, I get the feeling that the compiler would create a `TotalEq` impl for the type and the code would compile without an error (which is wrong). And a secondary (possibly worse?) consequence is `ShouldntBeTotalEq` would then implement `TotalEq`.\n",
