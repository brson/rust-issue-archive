    "body": "I think your rationale for defining `size_t` as `usize` where possible is pretty good. Anyone know why it uses `u32/u64` right now?\n\nI wonder if this is pulling too much C-standard lawyering into Rust, a place where it does not really belong. Rust already establishes some fundamentals which mean that not every theoretical C platform can be supported. I believe these are examples:\n- Rust assumes the type `u8` exists, basically that the byte is 8-bit, and further that types `u16, u32, u64` exist.\n- Rust assumes all (thin) pointer types are the same size.\n",

Overall I'm a bit on the fence about this change. In the rare case that `usize != size_t` then we're basically pushing the breakage from runtime to compile time (which seems good), but on the other hand it now seems that if that's the case then `libc` basically can't be right, which seems unfortunate.\n\nI think the breakage point of `libc` on crates.io may push me more towards the status quo for now, though.\n",

    "body": "> it now seems that if that's the case then libc basically can't be right, which seems unfortunate.\n\nWhat do you mean \"can't be right?\" If/when such a platform is supported, libc will need to be adapted. Such an adaptation would probably involve the introduction of helper function to do the possibly-truncating casting in a safe and convenient way. But, that was the case already. This change just makes it more obvious. And, I have a feeling that such a platform may never be added.\n\n> I think the breakage point of libc on crates.io may push me more towards the status quo for now, though\n\nI think that this is unlikely to break a lot of stuff, because I imagine very little code is written assuming that `libc::size_t` is `u32` or that `libc::ssize_t` is `i32`. I've got this repo building with these changes now locally on Linux, and that's a good sign as far as the compatibility impact.\n",

    "body": "@briansmith oh hm yeah that's a good point, we just wouldn't define `size_t = usize` on all platforms, we'd just say something like `size_t = u32` on those obscure platforms.\n\nOut of curiosity, did you encounter any breakage when building the compiler itself? Lots of casts look like they were removed but I doubt they were necessary to remove.\n\nSome good test cases may also be building both Cargo and Servo with a modified libc (e.g. using a Cargo path override), it'd certainly give me quite a bit of confidence in pushing this forward :)\n",

    "body": "Ok, the libs team talked about this RFC in triage today, and we are in general in favor of this approach. In that sense, we'd \"like to merge\" this RFC, but we're also considering the breakage in terms of external crates and such.\n\nThe good news is that I'm working on a revamp of the liblibc crate to live outside this repository (but get imported in). This is going to be a breaking change to the liblibc library no matter what, which is already going to be signaled through semver, so that would be a great opportunity to include changes like this. Overall that should assuage my worries about breakage as it's communicated through semver and we can announce it broadly.\n\nAlong these lines, here's what I think we should do about this PR currently:\n- The change to `size_t` and `ssize_t` may want to be backed out for now. We could apply it locally in the repository and hold off on publishing it, but it may be best to just hold out waiting for the liblibc revamp.\n- The change to the FFI lint seems like it should land ASAP. If we start liberally using `usize` and `isize` in FFI bindings we certainly shouldn't be receiving warnings about them!\n\n@briansmith would you be ok cutting this PR back to just modify the FFI lint? It's something we'd probably consider backporting to beta as well, and I can be sure to include the change to `size_t` and `ssize_t` in the reorganization of liblibc. How's that sound?\n",

    "body": "I agree it makes sense to change the FFI lint early. I will split that out into a separate commit.\n\nHowever, I don't think that this is actually a breaking change in practice. For all supported platforms, AFAICT, `ssize_t` is already equivalent to `isize` and `size_t` is already equivalent to `usize`, except for the need for a cast. That is, this change makes some casts unnecessary but it is very unlikely to cause more casts to be needed. The only case where it would break stuff is where somebody is passing an i32/u32 or i64/u32 to a function that takes an ssize_t/size_t, which seems likely to be rare.\n\nIn particular, when I built the rust compiler (the rust repo), there were ZERO failures building the compiler and libraries. The only failures right now (IIRC) are due to the fact that I don't know how to modify the tests for the lint, because I don't know how to format the comments that indicate the expected error text.\n\nLike I said, though, I will split out the changes to the lint so that it can land before the change for actually changing the definitions of ssize_t/size_t. In fact, it would be nice if the changes to the lint can be uplifted to beta as otherwise code that needs to work on stable would have to wait two releases before removing the casts.\n",
