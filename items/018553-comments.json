    "body": "Also even if we wanted to do this (which I don't want to) this implementation is nowhere near what we would need. I think you would want to get rid of `ExprLoop` entirely and add a method that applies a series of hacks to try to figure out whether a loop is endless to replace uses of it in the compiler. (You will at least need to consider things like `ExprParen(ExprLit(true))`.)\n\nThese hacks that you will have to add, by the way, are the reason I don't want to do this.\n",
