The technique is to make sub-modules within your crate `priv` (which will, eventually, be the default for unqualified mods) and to then write some `pub import` directives in the outer crate-level module, to re-expose the portions you want to be visible-outside-the-crate. That's all we're going to do for now; if it proves awful in practice we can reopen this, but for now I'm closing it.\n",

I can create a private sub-module and the parent module can control what is exported from the sub-module but afaict it's exported to everyone.\n\nHere's a motivating example. Fairly often I have some complex code with a very simple public API, often just a single function. I'd like to structure the code however I want. Maybe it's complex enough that I want to spread the implementation across multiple modules. Or maybe I want to split the code and unit tests into different modules. But as far as I know, I can't do any of this without making my implementation visible to everyone.\n\nPerhaps I am missing something but that is highly unsatisfactory. I really don't want to make my implementation details visible to clients, but I also really don't want to be forced into writing gargantuan modules. \n",

This is necessary to finally seal the leakiness of the select trait abstraction, cf #5160.\n\nHmm well, it's not strictly necessary, as all of the stuff that refers to what I wish to keep private could just be concatenated into the same file. But having it that way would mandate having enormous files which could otherwise be split apart.\n",
