  "body": "This patch series deals with retrieving the results of block expressions, particularly when those results are boxed. The strategy for pulling boxes out of block expressions is to allocate space to point to the box at the top of the function; when the block evaluates a boxed result it's copied to the alloca and upref'd; when the block's enclosing scope leaves the box is loaded from the alloca and downref'd.\n\nAt the end of this series standalone block expressions and if expressions can result in most types except for generic boxed types.\n\nNote that the second commit adds two utility functions, block_to_str and expr_to_str, to pprust. These are unrelated to the rest of the series, but I used them for debugging and didn't feel it was worth putting that commit into a separate pull request.\n",
