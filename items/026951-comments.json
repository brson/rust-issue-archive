    "body": "This is a @rust-lang/libs problem.\n\nI am of the opinion that aborts should only occur on problems that unwinding can't address. That is, if you overflow the capacity we _have_ to check for that, and we can panic right away. Everything will be cleaned up and the world will be happy. \n\nHowever if an allocation makes it past our checks and then fails _in_ the allocator, we have historically conservatively assumed that you are legitimately OOM and abort; unwinding can lead to arbitrary other allocations which is presumably bad to do during OOM.\n\nIn practice, the platforms we support basically _can't_ OOM naturally (by which I mean, you're asking for the last few bits of free memory), so I reckon if you ever managed to trigger an OOM it's because you managed to request All The Memory, in which case there's plenty of slack space for unwinding. If it's a legit OOM then we'll double panic and crash anyway.\n\nHowever https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14674 mentions that aborting on OOM enables LLVM to better optimize around allocations. I don't know the details.\n\nEdit: Regardless, I _do not_ want to add any kind of \"heuristic checks\" for \"will probably OOM\" or \"was probably a real OOM\".\n",

We don't have numbers.\n\nSo I reported this because I'd like to use `abort()` for both of the \"oom\" cases mentioned in the issue's description. It is sensible to do after we get a message on abort working (this is a bug).\n",

I think @bluss and I have both made our stances fairly clear, but to summarize (hopefully I'm not misrepresenting bluss):\n\nAlways Abort:\n- More consistent (always aborts when too much memory requested)\n- Potential theoretical perf gains to be had (llvm can optimize around straight-up ending the program)\n\nSometimes Abort:\n- Does \"the most friendly thing we can\" without incurring unnecessarily overhead (panics can recover -- aborts can't)\n\nNever Abort (wild card!):\n- There is no such thing as a \"true\" oom. You will be killed by your OS first. \n- Destructors unlikely to allocate and will just trigger a double panic => abort if they do.\n",

    "body": "@steveklabnik Thanks; I'm not too concerned with 'lots of work', but rather if I can produce well-behaved binaries for both FFI and server use. \n\nI started porting Imageflow over to Rust in June, but failed to verify that OOM panics (as widely reported) instead of aborting. I'd assumed that the stabilization of `std::panic::catch_unwind` meant Rust was ready for my use case. I decided to write a test today and, well, panicked. \n\nIt's very unclear to me where the anti-OOM-panic sentiment arises from. Double panics abort. \n\nI've been trying to track down blockers around this, but haven't been able to discover the reasons why movement on graceful OOM handling has been slow. I think I ?might? have found the right issue to discuss: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27700#issuecomment-243009177\n",
