    "body": "Thanks for the report, @magic003!\n\nThis is a known shortcoming of debuginfo in Rust at the moment:\nWhen you compile a crate exporting a generic function then the AST of the function is encoded in the crates metadata. Unfortunately, this encoded AST does not contain any source locations anymore (there's an issue open about this somewhere but I wasn't able to dig it up).\n\nWhen an external crate is referenced while compiling another crate, the ASTs of any generic functions from the external crate get copied into the current compilation so that the compiler can treat them mostly like normal, 'local' generic function definitions. At that point, there is no way of emitting source locations in the generated debuginfo for the function, since this information has been lost when initially compiling the external crate.\n\nAs soon as we implement that source locations are saved in the ASTs of generic functions, this should just work when compiling and using things on one machine.\n",
