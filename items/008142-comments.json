Havoc ensues below.\n#[unsafe_destructor]\nimpl<'c, 'b:'c, 'a:'b> Drop for P<'c, 'b, 'a> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        self.x.set(self.y);\n    }\n}\n\n#[allow(non_snake_case)]\nfn InvalidateOnDrop(s: &'static str) -> InvalidateOnDrop {\n    InvalidateOnDrop {\n        orig_value: s,\n        value: s,\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Drop for InvalidateOnDrop {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        self.value = \"invalidated\";\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Loud<'l1, 'l2:'l1> {\n    name: &'static str,\n    value: &'l1 Cell<&'l2 InvalidateOnDrop>\n}\n\n#[unsafe_destructor]\nimpl<'l1, 'l2> Drop for Loud<'l1, 'l2> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        let orig = self.value.get().orig_value;\n        let val = self.value.get().value;\n        if orig == val {\n            println!(\"dropping Loud {} pointing to {}\", self.name, val);\n        } else {\n            println!(\"dropping Loud {} pointing to {} (orig: {})\", self.name, val, orig);\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nfn main() {\n    let b = InvalidateOnDrop(\"b\");\n    let c = Cell::new(&b);\n    let _l1 = Loud { name: \"l1\", value: &c };\n    let a = InvalidateOnDrop(\"a\");\n    let _p = P { x: &c, y: &a };\n\n    let _l2 = Loud { name: \"l2\", value: &c };\n    println!(\"Hello World\");\n}\n```\n\n[playpen](http://is.gd/g7Qh8s)\n\nThe above prints out (if you are lucky and other data corruption does not happen first):\n\n```\nHello World\ndropping Loud l2 pointing to b\ndropping Loud l1 pointing to invalidated (orig: a)\n```\n\nthus illustrating that the `Loud` destructor observed a value in a post-drop state.  badness.\n",
