    "body": "This is quite an old bug, and rethinking on this I think that @thestinger is right in that the compiler cannot warn about situations such as this because the compiler does not understand the semantic meaning of each formatting flags. Implementors can assign meaning to cases such as this even if the standard formatting routines for the standard primitives don't.\n\nWe could in theory implement this sort of warning for the standard primitives, but that's probably overkill, so I'm going to close this.\n",
