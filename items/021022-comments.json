There was one in particular where the spans reported by the lifetime inference error messages were outright misleading and I basically had to guess to figure out what positions would actually work.\n\nSince this PR has improved graphviz output for the region inference constraints, I am hoping I might be able to use that to get really concrete descriptions of why the previous versions of the code were not working out.\n",
