    "body": "It would be nice if you mentioned the C headers/prototypes that are being bound here, e.g.\n\n``` C\nstruct Foo; /* Foo is a structure, but its contents are not part of the public interface */\nstruct Bar;\nvoid foo(struct Foo *arg);\nvoid bar(struct Bar *arg);\n```\n\nso that people know what an opaque struct looks like in C. This is something you don't really have to pay attention to a library user, so the terminology might be unclear (especially the distinction from the C++ or nonstandard C syntax `struct Foo {/* no members */};`.)\n\nWhich brings up one quibble I have here: if the original C API actually does use opaque structs, instead of void pointers, then C users of that API _are type-safe_. C compilers will warn you about casts between pointers of different types, unless `void *` is involved. So the first set of Rust bindings in these docs is _less type-safe than C_, which is probably not a thing we want to encourage. The phrasing \"we can at least get type-safety on the Rust side\" is a bit misleading here.\n\nI guess you were envisioning binding a C API that uses `void *` in its public declarations, but I think that lots of C APIs make good use of pointers to opaque structs for this very reason, and that's the use case that #27303 was getting at. Maybe it's worth mentioning both styles of C prototype, and making it clear that you can do the type-safe thing in Rust, whether or not the original C API is type-safe.\n",
