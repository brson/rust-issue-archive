The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

It's my best guess at replicating what http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ is doing. \n\nWhen the window size goes below 1060px it will switch to a mobile view and provides a button in the upper left to toggle showing the table of contents. The div that contains the toggle button is always there. If we want it to go away I would probably want to use a .js library. I'm happy to make that change as well, but I would want whoever is currently managing the docs site to weigh in on that. \n\nI've tested on Android, iOS, Firefox, Safai, Chrome (Mac) and the latest IE. It behaves the same, just let me know if the behavior is desired :) \n",

    "body": "You are correct, a 15px padding would be better for the margins on mobile. I'll make that change. \n\nThe CSS is using media query to toggle showing the hamburger. You should only see the hamburger when the table of contents is hidden in condensed mode. Pressing the hamburger toggle does get into a toggle mode that does not leave when the browser expands. ~~I can add some more one-off JavaScript to address it (most (all?) browsers don't honor media queries on resize), but it is starting to feel like using some sort of responsive framework would be helpful, but I don't think that's my decision to make.~~ \nSorry, I was completely mistaken. Not sure where I got the idea that browsers didn't adjust media queries on resize. I just tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari and they all work. I'll push that change as well. \n\nI collapsed the table at 1060px because the existing copy width was set to 750px and the table of contents at 250px. Those widths plus margins = 1060px. And eyeballed as looks good :). Most frameworks collapse around 1000px for a tablet version and again somewhere around 600 or 700px. Since the Rust Book is mostly code in pre elements I wanted to lean towards hiding the nav on tablet to give longer lines of code room to be seen without sidescrolling. \n",

    "body": "@sfaxon I want to bikeshed this some more, I hope you don't mind :)\n\nFirst off, you should probably set an explicit padding for `#toggle-nav`. Webkit applies a default of `padding: 3px 6px;` to `button`, but I'm not sure about other browsers.\n\nWhy are the bars 90% wide? 100% looks more symmetrical:\n\n![the_rust_programming_language](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20063/5719006/fed11a44-9b13-11e4-8e9b-92d0a0cb1ab2.png)\n\n(I changed the first button's `.bar` styles to use `width: 100%; padding: 0; margin: 3px 0 2px;`.)\n\nLast but not least, you should probably add a description of what that button does. A title would be nice for people not recognizing that it means \"menu\"/\"navigation\". Additionally, a textual representation for screen readers would improve accessibility quite a bit (I guess the text-only pages are otherwise accessible). Bootstrap uses this in their navbar ([cf. docs](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar)): `<span class=\"sr-only\">Toggle navigation</span>`.\n",

Is this just waiting to be merged?\n\nI do notice that toggling the navigation could be done using CSS3 `:target` only with no JS, but that's a minor detail. I also might have some opinions about the CSS on desktop, but I'd like to wait until this is merged before I touch anything. Mostly I'd like to know if enhancements to the web sites are welcome at this point.\n",
