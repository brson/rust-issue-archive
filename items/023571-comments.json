    "body": "This is really a documentation bug. First, we need to document that you have to explicitly link your macros when writing doctests for them. Second, because linking can only be done at a crate root and because rustdoc will implicitly wrap your test in a `main`, you have to encapsulate your tests in your own main in order to disable this.\n",
