I think almost every use case for atomics in Rust will be to implement concurrent data structures, with a rare case of a `static mut` atomic like a global counter for debugging or performance statistics.\n\nThey aren't really part of the user-level concurrency idioms in Rust (message passing), so it's okay if they aren't pretty.\n",
