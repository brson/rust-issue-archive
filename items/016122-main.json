  "body": "This patch primarily does two things: (1) it prevents lifetimes from\nleaking out of unboxed closures; (2) it allows unboxed closure type\nnotation, call notation, and construction notation to construct closures\nmatching any of the three traits.\n\nThis breaks code that looked like:\n\n```\nlet mut f;\n{\n    let x = &5i;\n    f = |&mut:| *x + 10;\n}\n```\n\nChange this code to avoid having a reference escape. For example:\n\n```\n{\n    let x = &5i;\n    let mut f; // <-- move here to avoid dangling reference\n    f = |&mut:| *x + 10;\n}\n```\n\nI believe this is enough to consider unboxed closures essentially\nimplemented. Further issues (for example, higher-rank lifetimes) should\nbe filed as followups.\n\nCloses #14449.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nr? @pnkfelix\n",
