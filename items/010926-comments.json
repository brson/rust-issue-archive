    "body": "@brson: If you want to have a tree with parent pointers without any `unsafe` code, you'll end up with something like this:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Node {\n    children: ~[Rc<Node>],\n    parent: Rc<Node>\n}\n```\n\nHowever, now there's a cycle between the parent and each child, so the entire data structure will leak.\n\nThese types allow you to do the following instead:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Node {\n    children: ~[Strong<Node>],\n    parent: Weak<Node>\n}\n```\n\nThe `Weak` pointer will only hold onto the box allocation, but the object will be destroyed as soon as the last `Strong` reference goes out of scope. This prevents a leak because the destructor will do a normal walk down the tree, destroying the weak references as it goes. Using a `Weak` pointer requires upgrading it back to a `Strong` reference, and it will return `None` if the object is dead.\n\nThis works for any case where ownership is a directed, acyclic graph. The `Weak` pointers allow for non-owning  cyclic references within the graph. A garbage collector allows you to ignore ownership completely, but you lose deterministic destruction. Until we have a tracing garbage collector this is the _only_ way to prevent leaks from cycles without `unsafe`.\n\nWe could add this functionality to Rc instead, but adding an extra word to the allocation and a branch to the destructor is a undesirable. I'm not sure if it's worth paying that price for simplicity at the moment because having super lightweight reference counting is quite nice and the vast majority of use cases won't need weak references.\n",
