  "body": "This is a bad default, because the binaries will point at an absolute\npath regardless of where they are moved. This opens up a security issue\nfor packages, because they will attempt to load libraries from a path\nthat's often owned by a regular user.\n\nEvery Rust binary is currently flagged by Debian, Fedora and Arch lint\ncheckers as having dangerous rpaths. They don't meet the requirements to\nbe placed in the repositories without manually stripping this from each\nbinary.\n\nThe relative rpath is still enough to keep the binaries working until\nthey are moved relative to the crates they're linked against.\n\nhttp://wiki.debian.org/RpathIssue\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Beware_of_Rpath\n",
