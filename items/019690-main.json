  "body": "Unlike a tuple variant constructor which can be called as a function, a struct variant constructor is not a function, so cannot be called.\n\nIf the user tries to assign the constructor to a variable, an ICE occurs, because there is no way to use it later. So we should stop the constructor from being used like that.\n\nA similar mechanism already exists for a normal struct, as it prohibits a struct from being resolved. This commit does the same for a struct variant.\n\nThis commit also includes some changes to the existing tests.\n\nFixes #19452.\n",
