  "body": "Largely, this is just being more specific about where tags get searched\nfor to remove external dependencies like src/llvm, which reduces the\nnumber of tags _enormously_ and significantly increases the usefulness\nof the tags file as it is then focusing on 240K lines of Rust code\nand 4.5K of C++ rather than just shy of 1M lines of C++ code (mostly\nfrom LLVM) and another 100K lines of Rust tests and a diverse collection\nof other languages.\n\nsrc/rustllvm/RustWrapper.cpp and src/rustllvm/PassWrapper.cpp are\ngetting tags made, but I'm not sure if that's desirable or not. At\nworst, it's not a significant wrong.\n\nA future, desirable step is producing tags for just libstd and libextra\nfor the use of people using Rust-the-language rather than working on\nRust itself.\n",
