The reason for it being ignored, according to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f8bd95589fceb893e5244f8f94e010a8b30f6529#diff-884e9fc8b00b17708aa78ee7e6645c6b , is that \"blk\" wasn't supported in the front-end. (Though I think the type checker was still doing something special for it, as shown here : https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f8bd95589fceb893e5244f8f94e010a8b30f6529/src/librustc/middle/typeck/check.rs#L580)\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, we should just kill that test.",

Categorize why the tests are ignored.\r\n    - In particular, a lot have \"not a test\" comments, so they can be moved to `auxiliary` folders to avoid compiletest trying to build them.\r\n2. Decide how to fix them. A lot have more specific issues associated with them and those you can probably just ignore. The rest will be on a case-by-case basis; you can ask on Zulip if you get stuck.
