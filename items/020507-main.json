  "body": "This commit is an implementation of [RFC 494](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0494-c_str-and-c_vec-stability.md) which removes the entire\n`std::c_vec` module and redesigns the `std::c_str` module as `std::ffi`.\n\nThe interface of the new `CString` is outlined in the linked RFC, the primary\nchanges being:\n- The `ToCStr` trait is gone, meaning the `with_c_str` and `to_c_str` methods\n  are now gone. These two methods are replaced with a `CString::from_slice`\n  method.\n- The `CString` type is now just a wrapper around `Vec<u8>` with a static\n  guarantee that there is a trailing nul byte with no internal nul bytes. This\n  means that `CString` now implements `Deref<Target = [c_char]>`, which is where\n  it gains most of its methods from. A few helper methods are added to acquire a\n  slice of `u8` instead of `c_char`, as well as including a slice with the\n  trailing nul byte if necessary.\n- All usage of non-owned `CString` values is now done via two functions inside\n  of `std::ffi`, called `c_str_to_bytes` and `c_str_to_bytes_with_nul`. These\n  functions are now the one method used to convert a `*const c_char` to a Rust\n  slice of `u8`.\n\nMany more details, including newly deprecated methods, can be found linked in\nthe RFC. This is a:\n\n[breaking-change]\nCloses #20444\n",
