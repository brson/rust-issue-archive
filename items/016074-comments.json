Do you mean whether or not there's a use for this ordering (outside of enabling the type to be used in an ordered container)? I guess that's where my hangup with `TreeSet` is, because I cannot think of a single use for it. There's also a degree of arbitrariness to it: why not list the `TreeSet` elements in descending order instead of ascending order before you compare the lists? Is there a strong argument besides \"the iter() method currently yields elements in ascending order\"? I think the bitflags ordering being defined here is similarly arbitrary and based largely on implementation details.\n",
