    "body": "@GuillaumeGomez thanks again for your patience on this issue. \n\nEven though I personally like dark themes, and want to be able to\naccomodate your use cases, I am still uneasy about this direction, and\nafter talking it over with several other team members, I am going to\nclose this PR.\n\nIt's a difficult decision, and I'll admit up front that the rationale for\nnot accepting it is soft, but it is as follows.\n\nFirst, this opens the door to proliferation of visual design across\nthe ecosystem.\n\nSecond, as with other attempts to overhaul the visual design of\nspecific aspects of rust's web presense, we are reluctant to add\nfeatures or make major changes, even with limited scope, largely\nbecause we don't have any firm direction when it comes to the overall\nvisual design of our web properties - we don't have a 'vision' in this\narea. We recognize this is a problem for the project and want to fix\nit, but are not prepared to do so now.\n\nOn the technical side, while not a large patch, this adds code\ngeneration to the rustdoc build system, a complicated solution for a\nminor feature that upstream won't even use.\n\nComplexity accumulates one feature at a time; this is a feature we do\nnot want right now, and accepting it even though its optional\nincreases the overall complexity of the (already messy) rustdoc\narchitecture. Reluctantly accepting patches we don't want to maintain\nis not something we can do in general, and not something we will do in\nthis case. Doing so has bit us many times in the past, resulting in\npoor design that had to be painfully reversed later. Sometimes we have\nto draw the line and say 'no'.\n\nI suggest that those that want to customize the rustdoc theme for now\nshould use browser-based css customization. We will happily consider\nchanges to CSS to accomodate such client-side customization.\n",
