  "body": "The \"m\" memory constraint in inline assembly is broken (generates incorrect code or triggers LLVM asserts) and should not be used. Instead, indirect memory operands should be used with \"*m\", \"=*m\" and \"+*m\".\n\nClang does this transparently by transforming \"m\" constraints into \"*m\" indirect constraints, but for now just being able to use \"*m\" directly is enough since asm! isn't stable.\n\nWhile \"*m\" works fine as an input operand, \"=*m\" and \"+*m\" need to be specified as input operands because they take a pointer value as an input. This PR relaxes the constraint checker to allow constraints starting with \"=\" or \"+\" if the constraint string contains a \"*\", which indicates an indirect operand.\n\nThis (indirectly) fixes these issues: #29382, #16383 and #13366. The code will need to be changed to use \"*m\" instead of \"m\".\n",
