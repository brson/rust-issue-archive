    "body": "@alexcrichton: A couple things:\n- First, with #12544, `#[deriving(Hash)]` no longer supports hashing with an arbitrary hasher, it only works with SipHash. Unfortunately that means if you want to play with arbitrary hashers, you need to manually implement `Hash` yourself.\n- Second, there isn't really a good way for a user that's turned on default type parameters to hash types like `Url`, `Path`, and `Uuid` if there isn't a generic Hash impl for `Url`. So I added explicit generic impls for those types.\n- Third, I agree these type parameters are getting a bit opaque. Fortunately though only the 4 typarams need to be used when you want to support a generic `HashMap`. End users will typically only have to deal with `HashMap<K, V>`. To help with `hashmap.rs` readability, the simplest thing we could do is give the `S` and `H` typarams better names. Replacing `S` with `HashState` and `H` with `Hasher` would be a bit clearer of their purpose. Ideally though we would clone @nikomatsakis a couple times and get all of them to implement associated items and move the `S` type into the `H` hasher type :)\n",
