    "body": "Taking examples from [D FFI doc](http://dlang.org/cpp_interface.html),\n\n``` C++\nint foo(int i, int j, int k);\n```\n\ncan be expressed in Rust as\n\n``` Rust\nextern \"C++\" {\n    fn foo(i: c_int, j: c_int, k: c_int) -> c_int;\n}\n```\n\nThis is straightforward; I've locally tuned rustc with [tiny proof-of-concept mangler](https://gist.github.com/klutzy/6634543) and it worked successfully.\n\nHowever, if C++ code is in some namespace e.g.\n\n``` C++\nnamespace A {\n    namespace B {\n        int foo(int i, int j, int k);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nthen we need to specify namespace in Rust since mangled function name contains it (at least on linux). One way to achieve that is:\n\n``` Rust\n#[namespace = \"A::B\"]\nextern \"C++\" {\n    fn foo(i: c_int, j: c_int, k: c_int) -> c_int;\n}\n```\n\nI didn't tried to implement it, but it is still not hard; the only stuff I have to do is name mangling.\n\nClasses and methods are more challenging: we need discussion on syntax. Again from D example,\n\n``` C++\nclass D {\npublic:\n   virtual int bar(int i, int j, int k);\n}\nD *getD();\n```\n\nHow this can be expressed in Rust? I've initially thought:\n\n``` Rust\nextern \"C++\" {\n    trait D {\n        fn bar(i: c_int, j: c_int, k: c_int) -> c_int;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nbut `D* getD();` becomes tricky since we don't have raw pointer to traits. Maybe we can treat `extern C++ trait` as structs as well, but it may be unintuitive for users.\n",

    "body": "1. Could this be a motivation for adding `D*` (where D is a trait) to our grammar, even if its only to support a detail of the FFI?  (In particular, I imagine you would _not_ be able to do `D* as D&` etc...)  \n   Ugh, even just writing it down makes me say \"no that seems bad.\"\n2. We don't _have_ to shoehorn Rust's syntax into something matching C++ semantics, because we have macros, right?  \n   (Obviously the macros will need to then expand into something, and so its important to specify what that something is, in terms of what the interface to the end user is.  E.g. as @klutzy points out, we still need to figure out what `class D` maps to.  And of course we don't have macro-expansion in all the relevant contexts, such as type-expressions, so you'd still want the macro to generate bindings for sane identifiers that can be used elsewhere directly.  But I think we can separate the two concerns here...)\n3. Ignoring the question of macros and continuing with @klutzy's idea of leveraging attributes, we could map each C++ class to two distinct bindings in Rust: one for its data layout (--> struct), and one for its vtable (--> trait).\n\nFor example:\n\n``` c++\nclass S {\n  int x;\n  virtual void foo();\n  void bar();\n}\nclass T : public S {\n  int y;\n  void baz();\n}\nvoid process(S* arg);\nS* getS();\n```\n\ncould be expressed as:\n\n``` rust\n\nextern \"C++\" {\n  #[class = \"S\"]\n  struct Simpl { x: int, }\n\n  #[class = \"S\"]\n  trait Stable {\n    fn foo(*self),\n  }\n  impl Simpl { fn bar(*self); }\n  impl Stable for Simpl { fn foo(*self); }\n\n  #[class = \"T\"]\n  struct Timpl { super_: Simpl, y: int, }\n  impl Stable for Timpl { fn foo(*self); }\n  impl Timpl { fn baz(*self); }\n\n  fn process<S:Stable>(arg: *S);\n  fn getS() -> *Simpl;\n}\n```\n\n(one could imagine rearranging the above a bit, pulling the `struct` items out of the extern block, and moving their `#[class=..]` attributes down instead to the `impl Simpl` and `impl Timpl` items.  Not sure if that helps or hurts.  Anyway I imagine the trait item needs to stay in the extern block, since a C++ vtable need not be compatible with a Rust trait vtable.)\n",
