Would the original example from the RFC be a suitable \"trivial container\" to illustrate this?\n\n~~(I ask because I view `compile-fail/issue28498-reject-ex1.rs` as an _expansion_ of such a trivial container, so I am a little surprised to see you react so strongly to it.  But switching to the example from the RFC is certainly easy; I just wanted to better understand the problem you have, which I assume is that it may confuse other people reading the commits about how truly simple-minded the new `dropck` is...)~~\n- Update: On re-reading `compile-fail/issue28498-reject-ex1.rs`, I now retract my claim that it is merely an \"expansion\" of a trivial container.  I have come around to @arielb1 's POV that it really is demonstrating something different, and I should just go back to the example from the RFC.\n\n---\n\n> I would also add a test for the interaction of UGEH with param bounds \n\nGood idea; will do.\n\n---\n\n> pnkfelix: I don't like the \"unreachable\" parametricity-checking code\n\nYeah that had a \"bad code smell\" to me as well.  The reason I left it in:\n- other work has led me to think that the `unsafe_destructor_blind_to_params` attribute is not fine-grain enough (it essentially tags _all_ type formals as parametric, when I think we actually want to specify parametricity for individual type parameters for some cases, if not now then in the near future),\n- and I was/am not sure if a finer-grain attribute will end up needing the other code, so I didn't want to immediately delete it.\n\nI am in the midst of investigating the finer-grain attribute now, so that should help inform me as to whether the other code should indeed be deleted \n",

Types without destructors are destruction-safe when their contents are.\n- To allow for library-defined containers, it is possible to create types _with_ destructors that are destruction-safe when their contents are.\n- However, these types must be careful as they can be destroyed with their contents not being alive.\n",
