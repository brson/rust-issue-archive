    "body": "It works today, and the existence of the workaround is the main reason why I personally did not push on the \"enum mod\" issue (#10090) after it was rejected in the meeting (where the rejection boiled down to \"one catastrophic change per quarter\").\n\nI have no information on what other code uses it, but I use this pattern very deliberately inside rust-lua because it's the best fit for the lua API. Besides making the enum variant name most closely match the C API, the C API in this case actually uses the same error cases for two different error-returning APIs, where one scenario allows for more errors than the other. This was easy to do in C, but in Rust, I needed to model the two error-erturning APIs with separate enums. In order to preserve the fact that the Lua C API uses the same name in both scenarios, I wanted to use the same variant name for my enums, which means the enums needed to be scoped into their own modules.\n\nBasically, removing this feature makes the rust-lua API objectively worse, with no recourse. I see no benefit in doing that.\n",

Simon mentioned that the compiler wasn't enforcing this, but I guess that comment got lost as there was no response. Regardless, Niko's understanding matches mine.\n\nI think the workaround is going to be something like `LoadError::LoadError` or `LoadError::T`.\n",

    "body": "@kballard I'm curious about how you think types and modules in the same namespace should work. There is only a single `use` construct, not a `use type` or `use mod`, etc. so there is currently no way to distinguish between the two in a `use` item. For example, this program compiles:\n\n``` rust\nuse A::B;\n\nmod A {\n    pub mod B {\n        pub struct C { pub n: int }\n    }\n    pub struct B { pub n: int }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let _ = B { n: 1 };\n    let _ = B::C { n: 1 };\n}\n```\n\nIf you use the name of a type or module with a function, e.g.\n\n``` rust\nuse A::B;\n\nmod A {\n    pub struct B { n: int }\n    fn B() { }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let _ = B();\n}\n```\n\nthen you get an error:\n\n```\ntest.rs:1:5: 1:10 error: type `B` is inaccessible\ntest.rs:1 use A::B;\n              ^~~~~\n```\n\nStrangely, the error goes away if I delete the actual use of `B()` in `main`, which seems broken. The error makes more sense if the struct is a tuple struct:\n\n```\ntest.rs:5:5: 5:15 error: duplicate definition of value `B`\ntest.rs:5     fn B() { }\n              ^~~~~~~~~~\ntest.rs:4:5: 4:23 note: first definition of value `B` here\ntest.rs:4     pub struct B(int);\n              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n```\n",

For example, `serialize::json::List` refers to both an enum variant and a type. Is that a bug too?\n\n``` rust\npub enum Json {\n    Number(f64),\n    String(String),\n    Boolean(bool),\n    List(List),\n    Object(Object),\n    Null,\n}\n\npub type List = Vec<Json>;\npub type Object = TreeMap<String, Json>;\n```\n\nModules vs. types are the only case [mentioned in the manual](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15443#issuecomment-48079334). What about every other combination?\n\nOther random test cases:\n\nErrors:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo() {}\nstruct foo;\n```\n\nCompiles:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo() {}\nenum foo {}\n```\n\n@pcwalton, what\u2019s obviously a bug in your mental model is not at all obvious to me when I don\u2019t know what the rules are supposed to be.

    "body": "After giving this some more thought, I'm likely the only person who really cares about the ability to use this functionality, so I withdraw my objection. I still believe this is being handled wrong, and that 8 months of having such functionality be accepted as something one can legitimately do in Rust (especially publicized as an alternative to a language proposal) warrants more than just declaring \"it's a bug\" and submitting a fix without notice. But if I really am the only person who genuinely cares, then I guess I can deal with it.\n\nFWIW, the mental model that says \"types and modules live in the same namespace\" only makes sense if you consider every type to have an associated `impl TypeName {}` block implied. Because apparently it's the _impl_ that produces a module for the given type, which in fact already means that we cannot write ambiguous code today with the bug in effect (because the only way to write ambiguous code is to have an `impl` block on the type).\n\nIn fact, in light of that observation, I'm not even convinced this really is a bug anymore. At least, not in the compiler. I'm wondering if this is instead merely a bug in your mental model that says \"types and modules share a namespace', because apparently the behavior of the language says that types and modules don't share a namespace, but that types gain an associated module when you write an `impl` block on the type. With that model, there's no need to change the compiler at all. But again, if I am really the only person who cares, then I won't try to stop you.\n",

    "body": "> A lot of people want to be able to write `type Foo = Bar; Foo::new()`, which goes along with that.\n\nThis is the first truly convincing argument I've seen in favor of making this change. In fact, I actually hit this precise error while working on my `local_data` rewrite and didn't even realize at the time what the implications were. After landing this PR, are you planning on fixing it so that works?\n",
