    "body": "This is probably blocked on rewriting resolve. I want the exports from libc to have the following characteristics:\n- There is a list of explicit exports-from-libc that is statically checked to ensure those definitions are present on all platforms. In the rewrite this will probably take the form of a list of `pub import ...` directives.\n- There are a bunch of residual globs that pick up and re-export everything _else_ beyond the intersection list, so that when you're on platform `foo` that has a libc definition `funcs::os::extras::bar()` you can just call `libc::bar()` and it'll build _on that platform_. But you will have made platform-specific code by doing so. This will be a list of `pub import ...*` globs.\n\nCurrently, export globs don't work terribly well. They kinda work for exporting a bunch of items, but not for re-exporting a glob-import from somewhere else. And I think there was an ordering problem of some sort. I eventually gave up and left it as-is, with the few platform-specific cases explicitly glob-importing definitions from the inner modules of libc. Which is undesirable in the longer term.\n",
