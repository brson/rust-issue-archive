I'm not proposing we go back to how things were before.\n\nThe rust-core library is _mostly_ (some numerics stuff is still in `intrinsics`) doing it as a single export location for each intrinsic along with some of them having a wrapper to give them a saner name or mark them as safe. It makes things much simpler for users of the standard library, such as the standard library itself.\n",
