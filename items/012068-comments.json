However, it's clear that it's unable to provide the requirements expected of `Eq` and `Ord` while still using the usual comparison semantics so there's not a strong reason to change `min`, `max` and `clamp` to methods. The `min` and `max` method names should really not be reserved by such a common trait.\n",
