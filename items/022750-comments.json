It's very much a good thing that cargo allows pulling in multiple versions of a crate. In _some_ cargo issue that I can't find now, I advocated that what we would actually want is some syntax like\n\n``` toml\n[dependencies]\nserver = \"1.2.3\"\nhyper = { from: \"server\" }\n```\n\nCrates also publicly expose hyper (or other building-block libraries) as part of their **public API** but without properly accounting for everything that entails.\n\nHowever, there is **always** the case for better error messages! \ud83d\ude38 \n",
