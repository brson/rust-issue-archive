    "body": "Closing as working as intended. The `as_ref` function specifically takes `<T: 'static>` which means that the only invalid thing done here is the call to `as_ref` (not the construction).\n\nWhat you need to do is to specify that `Object` adheres to a `'static` lifetime via:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Object { val: Box<Any + 'static> }\n```\n\nThat way rustc can understand that the boxed trait indeed doesn't have any borrowed pointers.\n",
