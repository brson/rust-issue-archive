  "body": "r? @nikomatsakis This patch causes `self` to be inherited from the enclosing function context when typechecking nested closures, allowing default methods to call inherited methods on `self`. This is effectively treating `self` like it has dynamic scope, for the purposes of typechecking. I think it should be sound to do so, since any incorrect uses of `self` would already have been flagged by resolve.\n\nThis addresses #3563.\n",
