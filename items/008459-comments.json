    "body": "@brson: There are `Checked{Add,Sub,Mul}` traits implementing overflow checking via the LLVM intrinsics, and returning `Option<Result>` to indicate whether there was an overflow. They'll replace manual, error-prone overflow checks such as the one in the vector `reserve` function and the missing one in `with_capacity`.\n\nFor division, there's no intrinsic because there isn't really a way to do it faster than just checking the error case (`INT_MIN / -1`). I added the trait because it will be expected (due to the others existing), and it's a convenient way to do the check for division by zero along with handling the signed overflow case.\n\nThe saturating operations clamp to the bounds, and should likely be reimplemented in terms of these traits. @kballard used them to to factor out some duplication in the iterator size hints, but beyond that I don't know if they often be used.\n",
