    "body": "I don't think that's obvious. Haskell works that way, because in Haskell type and data constructors are declared separately. But for Rust's structs a single declared name is used for both. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that if you introduce an alias for that one name, you can use it in the same places as the original name, IOW that the constructor has the same name as the type. That's what C++ does. E.g. this is valid:\n\n```\nstruct foo_struct { int a; foo_struct(int _a): a(_a) { } };\ntypedef foo_struct foo;\nfoo f = foo(0);\n```\n\nI think the logical thing would be for it to work the Haskell way for enums (where there are separate names) and the C++ way for structs (where there's a single name), but at the very least I don't think the opposite is self-evident.\n",

    "body": "The code being matched is a `Some(DefTy(syntax::ast::DefId{krate: 0u32, node: 8u32}), LastMod(AllPublic))`. This seems to match the first arm, so it's the guard that's the issue. Basically, the class_id is not in self.structs even though, as an alias, it should be there.\n\nRemoving the guard leads to `error: internal compiler error: struct ID bound to non-struct`, which makes sense. We'll have to add the type to the structs array when its parsed -- the code seems to expect this to happen. Somewhere [here](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/resolve.rs#L1185), I guess, but I'll have to figure out how I can check if the ItemTy is a struct.\n",

    "body": "Tuple struct constructors are first-class functions, like variant constructors. So the declaration of a tuple struct injects a value into the value namespace. The variable in an expression like `x()` looks for a name in the value namespace. However, the structure name in a structure literal expression like `S { ... }` (also structure patterns like `S { ... }`) looks for a name in the _type_ namespace. The typedef declaration `type` only adds a name to the type namespace, not the value namespace. So it works for named structure literals and patterns, but not for tuple structs.\n",
