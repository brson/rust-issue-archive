    "body": "I would prefer not to build `option` into the language. System `malloc` usually aligns to eight bytes; on x64 the high 16 bits of every pointer are also free (all implementations are currently 48 bit addressed). It's not too hard for us to wire these (or a similar assumptions that the compiler can \"know\") into our handling of boxed values, and it means a bunch of cases drop to half their size.\n\nIssue #1704 requests a `packed` modifier. I'm ok with `packed enum { ... }` knowing enough about pointers to pull this trick when it can find the bits to stuff the tag values into. It's not like we have to maintain compatibility with C handling here. C doesn't have disjoint unions, and most C code that emulates this sort of thing does in fact do just this.\n",
