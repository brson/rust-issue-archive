    "body": "yes, as @pmarcelll says, this is a dup.\n\n> Why did the compiler even suggest I use core, if it wasn't going to allow it?\n\nBasicaly, re-exported types don't have the information stored with them that they've been re-exported, so they use their non-re-exported name. Fixing this is going to be a fairly big refactoring, from what I've heard.\n\n> I also find it weird that built in code depends on core, but I myself am not allowed to use it.\n\nThis is because it's not stable yet. If you used a nightly compiler, you'd be allowed to.\n\nAnyway, I'm closing since this is a dup, but you're completely right that it is a big usability issue. Sorry for the confusion :/\n",
