    "body": "@graydon Ports have a representation in the runtime, which means native code could call `rust_port::send`, or whatever the appropriate method is if they want to deliver a message to a Rust task. As far as I know, this was never done.\n\nThe tricky part that pipes would actually need to handle now is in `core::priv`, where we store a `chan` casted as a pointer in a global variable in the runtime. This is how we can have a single task to manage, for example, the OS environment, but any task can get access to it at any time.\n\nWith pipes, this is problematic for a couple reasons. First off, we can't just cast a pipe to a pointer, because they are not word sized anymore. Pipes can't directly be shared, although we could use `pipes::shared_chan` to emulate this. In my mind, the hardest issue is that someone needs to run the destructor on the pipe that somehow got stored in global memory. I guess this could just be the OS environment task (or the equivalent task for libuv).\n",
