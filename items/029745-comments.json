    "body": "Hey @thibault-ml ! First off, sorry that I left no comment here. New year, finding out old issues that slipped through the cracks. :)\n\nI'm working on a new draft of the book that's basically completely re-written, and so will cover this stuff in a lot more depth. So I'm not as focused on tweaking the existing one. So if you wanted to send a PR with some updates, I would probably accept them, but for now, this isn't super likely to change. I do agree that this is a weakness, but it'd take some work to fix, and would end up going away anyway... thank you for bringing it up!\n",
