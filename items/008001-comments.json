    "body": "This is a generic problem with windows in that stack unwinding is not implemented yet. This means that task failure is not caught at task boundaries, but rather the entire task dies (same thing as #8013).\n\nThis doesn't show up in bors-automated testing because of the `xfail-fast` tag, but if we're being pedantic about these tests we'd have to be pedantic about _every_ run-pass tests which invokes `fail!()` at some point (and expects it to be caught at a task boundary).\n\nIn the meantime though, could you remove the merge commit via rebasing? bors will add his own when it gets merged in.\n",
