    "body": "Yeah I've wanted this in the past as well from time to time, and there's a few consequences to doing this.\n- We probably want to do this through `AsRef` instead of `IntoInner`, but that's exposing an implementation detail of these types. That's probably not the end of the world though as I can't imagine these types ever changing.\n- The literal type stored right now is `libc::in6_addr` which is a private type to the standard library (e.g. the private distribution of libc). Notably it's different than the crates.io-based libc crate. We can fix this, however, by expanding the `std::os::raw` module to contain these types. I believe they're all defined on all platforms anyway.\n\nOverall, however, I think this is fine to do. I'd like a bit more discussion to make sure there's consensus (as impls are insta-stable), but the traits we could implement are:\n\n```\nimpl AsRef<in_addr> for Ipv4Addr { ... }\nimpl AsRef<in6_addr> for Ipv6Addr { ... }\n\nimpl AsRef<sockaddr_in> for SocketAddrV4 { ... }\nimpl AsRef<sockaddr_in6> for SocketAddrV6 { ... }\n```\n",

    "body": "@dimbleby so, additions to Rust these days happen in two ways: minor changes have a PR, major changes have an RFC. We don't really keep issues open to track possible additions, as in both cases, they'd be tracked by either the PR or in the RFCs repo.\r\n\r\nSo, given that there's additional complexity here, an RFC issue and/or PR would be a better place to handle that discussion. Does that make sense?",
