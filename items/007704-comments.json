    "body": "The `~T` does too: the `T` value has to be copied into the memory allocated by the `~` when you create it; moves of the `~T` just copy the pointer (so one word), but copies allocate a new `~`-box and copy the whole data across. \n\nMost iterator objects are fairly small so the copies (with plain `T`) aren't expensive and they are unlikely to be a performance bottle neck anyway, unless one is parsing a huge number of very small JSON files. (If the writer of an iterator object is concerned about size, they could wrap it in a `~`/`@` themselves to make copies cheaper).\n",
