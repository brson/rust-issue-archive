    "body": "Thanks for the report. At the moment the .debug_gdb_scripts is not emitted on Windows on purpose since it caused GDB to freeze during startup (at least on my machine). I'll give it another try when I find the time.\nIf somebody wants to try this locally, they just have to adapt `needs_gdb_debug_scripts_section` in  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_trans/trans/debuginfo/gdb.rs. Any feedback on which setups (Windows version, GDB version, ...) it works or doesn't work is helpful.\n",
