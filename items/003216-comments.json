This is something we need to spend some time on before 0.4; it's sufficiently bad that we're seeing people landing a lot of code (myself included) without completing a full testsuite run.

Currently `rusti` feeds input 3 times to the compiler per line of input, so it's very very slow as a result of this. While `rusti` has its own class of performance issues, speeding this up would certainly help speeding that up.\n\nNominating for production-ready\n",
