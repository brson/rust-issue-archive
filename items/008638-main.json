  "body": "\"non-mechanical\" : there was lots more hacking than the other more-mechanical ports Felix did.\n\nr? @huonw.  (Or @nikomatsakis ; I just want someone to sanity-check this.  Its not a thing of beauty.)\n\nFollowup to #8623.  (See #8527, which was step 1 of 5, for the full outline.  Part of #7081.)\n\nNotes on the change follow.\n\nThere's also a strange pattern that I hacked in to accommodate the\nOuter/Inner traversal structure of the existing code (which was\npreviously encoding this by untying the Y-combinator style knot of the\nvtable, and then retying it but superimposing new methods that \"stop\nat items\").  I hope either I or someone else can come back in the\nfuture and replace this ugliness with something more natural.\n\nAdded boilerplate macro; all the OuterLint definitions are the same\n(but must be abstracted over implementing struct, thus the macro).\n\nRevised lint.rs use declarations to make ast references explicit.\nAlso removed unused imports.\n",
