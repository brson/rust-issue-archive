    "body": "Yeah when I was running through the book my flow usually goes along the lines of recreating the example in a similar manner, but not exactly copying the code so when I went to create my example to see the basic usage shown in the example:\n\n```\nfn main()\n{\n    enum AgeScaling {\n        Kid,\n        Teen,\n        Adult\n    }\n\n    let cmp = |&: age: i32| -> AgeScaling {\n        if age <= 12 {\n            AgeScaling::Kid\n        } else if age < 18 && age > 12 {\n            AgeScaling::Teen\n        } else {\n            AgeScaling::Adult\n        }\n    };  \n\n    let yourscale = cmp(17);\n    if yourscale == AgeScaling::Adult {\n        println!(\"You're allowed to watch adult videos\");\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Go away\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI would get binary operator == annot be applied to type AgeScaling, which is confusing because my example is almost exactly similar to the example in the book.  This made me think everything I was doing wrong so I googled and found out that I needed to use [derive(PartialEq)](actually it shown deriving, but I remember reading deriving was deprecated about a week or so ago when I was messing around with rust and sdl2 so I changed it to derive) above my enum and everything was sorted.\n\nMy issue with this is there will be multiple \"beginners\" reading this guide, doing exactly what I did and coming across googling and noticing the book doesn't talk about this usage at all.  In my opinion the book shouldn't use the build in Ordering enum because it won't have the exact results as someone doing what I did and also talk about the [derive(...)] stuff explaining you haven't seen this before, but we'll explain it more in a future part of the book.\n",
