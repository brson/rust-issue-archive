    "body": "Just to be clear for where I use this (in case you don't know), it's in a situation like this.  Often I have an enum where the variants have different numbers of things associated with them (let's say integers here). Sometimes it's handy to match and only have to deal with the exact right number of integers for each case, but other times I want to just walk over all the integers. For some reason, it often happens that the variants have either 0, 1, or N such things. This works out quite nicely:\n\n```\nenum Foo {\n    A, // no integers\n    B(u32), // 1 integer\n    C(Vec<u32>), // >1 integer\n}\n\nimpl Foo {\n    fn get_integers(&self) -> &[u32] {\n        match *self {\n            Foo::A => &[],\n            Foo::B(ref i) => ref_slice(i),\n            Foo::C(ref v) => v,\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis seems to come up semi-regularly for me. (Sadly, the methods that let you go from `&(T, T)` to `&[T]` were removed, or it would work even for an arbitrary number of integers.)\n\nThe other situation where this fn comes in handy for me is when you have some generic helper that takes a `&[T]`, but you happen to have an `&T` lying around. You can easily reuse this helper.\n\nI think it's ok for this to live in libstd. It's not really duplicating anything else; I mean it's true you can write them in terms of other APIs, but only by dropping into unsafe code and going into a whole 'nother level of abstraction.\n\n(That said, if there were to be another crate that ALSO included the ability to convert tuples into slices and so forth, that's more interesting. Though that's probably something we can't \"safely\" do until we agree to commit to the way tuples are represented in memory, though I could never imagine us changing this.)\n",

The layout of the data in the pointed-to area of memory is the same, it doesn't extend the lifetime of the reference, and it doesn't change an `&T` to an `&mut [T]`.\n\nThis is absolutely consistent and is actually a very concise example of a core Rust idiom: that safe wrappers can be created around `unsafe` code if they can guarantee certain invariants. Here, the invariants are just very easy to enforce. \n",

In C they _are_ the same type. The standard library has stuff for doing networking, hashing, spawning processes and threads all of which could be spun off into separate libraries but if I want to treat a value as an array of length one I need an auxiliary crate?\n\nWhat does it matter if people only need it from time to time?

These methods can be trivially implemented elsewhere (e.g. `mem::transmute::<&T, &[T; 1]>(ptr)`) and a safe wrapper can be placed around them. Conversions like slices, on the other hand, need to happen in the standard library or with some standard structure for the ordering of the ptr/length fields.\n\nAlso note that this isn't a permanent-until-the-end-of-time decision. We can always choose to include these functions in the future!\n\n---\n\n@arielb1 \n\nThat sounds... worrisome!

    "body": "@alexcrichton \n@Gankro \n\nLLVM supports something called \"TBAA\", which marks every memory access with the type-path used to access it.\n\nThe idea is that each C \"object\" has exactly one type, so if you have code like the following\n\n``` C\nstruct foo {\n    int a[16];\n};\nstruct bar {\n    int b;\n};\nvoid test(struct foo* foo, struct bar *bar) {\n    for(int i=0; i<16; i++)\n        foo->a[i] += bar->b;\n}\n```\n\nthen `bar` can't point into the middle of `foo` (because otherwise the \"object\" would need to have the types both `struct foo` and `struct bar`), and the compiler can hoist the load of `bar->b` out of the loop. This is implemented by giving every memory access a type-path (`struct foo \u2192 int \u2192 memory` and `struct bar \u2192 int \u2192 memory` in this case) and assuming accesses with incompatible paths don't alias (in C, accesses to `char` use the tag `memory`, and therefore are compatible with everything).\n\nThe problem is that nothing in safe Rust is preventing us from having `[u32] \u2192 u32 \u2192 memory`, or even `[u32; 1] \u2192 [u32] \u2192 u32 \u2192 memory`, as a TBAA tag, because you can't access a `u32` field in a struct via a `&[u32]` array reference, or even a subslice of a `&[u32; 3]` via a `&[u32; 1]` (AFAIK). On the other hand, this will break `ref_slice` (as e.g. `Option<u32> \u2192 u32 \u2192 memory` isn't compatible with `[u32] \u2192 u32 \u2192 memory`), and in addition any theoretical method turning a `&[u32]` to a `&[u32; 1]` after a bounds check. We need to decide which semantics we prefer, and having `ref_slice` in `std` decides it solidly.\n\nAnyway, we don't use TBAA at this moment, and it is not as important because of Rust's aliasing guarantees, but we want to reserve the right to add it in the future.\n",
