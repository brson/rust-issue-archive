    "body": "This is the best solution.  However, there is a simpler variant that might be worth doing as a \"first try\": allow a subset of Rust code that is \"non-blocking\" and only allow C callbacks into that.  This would probably take the form of requiring a \"blocking\" flag similar to \"unsafe\"... hmm... this is probably not worth the language complexity price.  So, never mind, I think the idea is poor, but I will leave this comment for reference anyhow.\n",
