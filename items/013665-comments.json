    "body": "cc @nikomatsakis @pnkfelix\nI've seen similar behavior around iterators and closures, is this related in any way to method lookup improvements?\n\n@chridou TBQH, few people actually know the distinction, but the _borrow_ checker is doing its job perfectly here - the issue is in the _region_ checker, which does lifetime inference, and in this case the lifetimes it assigns are shorter than they could be.\n\nThis doesn't show up in regular functions as they require a complete signature, but closures can omit types (and lifetimes), making them vulnerable to inaccurate inference.\n\nEven worse, you might not be able to name the input/output lifetimes (if they're temporaries in the outer function, for example) to work around such an issue, and can end up needing a function generic over the lifetime - there's syntax for generic lifetime types, but not expressions, AFAIK:\n\n``` rust\n<'a> |&'a T| -> &'a U // returns a reference with the same lifetime as its input\n```\n",
