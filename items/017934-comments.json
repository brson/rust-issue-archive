    "body": "FYI, the patch looks roughly right to me. Might be worth comparing the set of AST cases to mem-categorization code -- I think it should corresponding to ownership, basically. One thing that seems to be missing are some run-pass (and compile-fail) tests corresponding to these various cases. Best would probably be:\n1. Some run-pass tests that just test that vectors can be used in various scenarios.\n2. Some tests analogous to the deref tests that check that the mut versions of `Deref` and `Index` are actually being invoked. \n3. Some compile-fail tests checking that things which don't implement derefmut/indexmut fail when used in improper ways.\n\nSome of these tests may exist from prior patches, of course.\n",
