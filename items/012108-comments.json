The notion of an assert is very common amongst all languages and libraries, and I don't think that we should be completely removing the name \"assert\".\n\nRight now we don't have a debug assertion, and I think that it's a problem. In my opinion the world should look like:\n- There are two assertion macros, one called `assert` and one not called assert.\n- Both macros are turned on by default\n- You can selectively turn one of them off with a `--cfg` flag\n\nI don't really have a strong preference as to which bucket `assert` falls into, but I very much want the name `assert` to stick around.\n",

I don't see a need for Rust to deviate from the expectation of many users rather than giving it a less overloaded name like `enforce!` that's _clearly_ not going to be disabled in a release build. There are many assertions in the Rust codebase only there to verify that the code is correct and not enforce invariants, and they are a significant contribution to the standard library's poor performance and code bloat. For example, there are assertions on every `RefCell` borrow. These shouldn't be there by default... and if assertions are enabled by default, they will just have to be removed completely from places like this.\n\nIf it's on by default in a release build, then it's not a debugging feature. Code will be built to depend on the failure being thrown and caught. It's definitely not what I think of as an assertion.\n",

I don't personally think that enforce/assert is a good split because it's not clear which one gets optimized away and which one doesn't (I think it's the same problem with assert/check). The debug_assert/assert split is quite clear, but the debug version is a tad bit long. Using dassert/assert it's not super clear that dassert == debug assert.\n\n(just my current thoughts)\n",

    "body": "+1 to @Kimundi's suggestion. There is long-standing precedent from many languages that assertions are for enforcing static properties you believe will never fail -- and hence it is safe to remove them. I see no reason to change the name assert.\n\nThe biggest question is if we should compile asserts out by default under `-O`. Coming from C, I'd assume that assertions are removed under `-O` but not `-O -g`, but I assume we'll want this to be configurable.\n\nI know that the choice to have assertions _always_ be compiled in was a conscious choice.\n",

    "body": "> - Modify assert! to be disabled when ndebug is defined\n> - Warn people about the changing semantics.\n\nI strongly disagree with these two steps as they stand: `assert` has been the name of the non-disablable assertion forever, and so just changing the semantics of it will change all downstream code as well as any code someone writes with `assert!` out of habit.\n\nI think we should have disableable `assert!` under a different name at least until (the arbitrary milestone of) 0.10, so that people get compiler _errors_ and have to explicitly make a decision about how to update their code.\n\n(Unless you mean a compiler warning, but that seems needlessly complicated compared to just renaming it to something different temporarily, and wouldn't help in the main codebase since people would presumably want to be using disableable asserts and so the warning would have to be disabled.)\n",

    "body": "@kballard, I'll reiterate here what's also mentioned in the notes.\n\nThe current pattern is that we're seeing a fair amount of pushback from having only an always-on assert. The reason for this is perf reasons, code bloat, etc. The downside of this is that it's causing authors to _not_ write asserts in their code. This I believe is the worst of all worlds.\n\nIf you then accept the fact that we need a disableable assert, the question is do you also have an assert that cannot be disabled. You are then faced with the problem that you have two very similar things, of which everyone needs to make a choice. Newcomers and even rust veterans will constantly have to make a decision about which they want. Documentation can overcome the misunderstanding problem, but the problem of having to make a choice is difficult to overcome.\n\nFor now, we have chosen to continue that which has a massive amount of precedent which is to be able to disable asserts. For sanity of choice, we have also decided to have only one.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I believe we need both a disableable and a non-disableable assert.\n\nLeaving out the non-disableable assert does not remove the choice. With things as currently proposed, I now have to make a choice between `assert!()` or `if !cond { fail!(..) }`. I believe that there is enough of a need for non-disableable asserts that we should vend a macro for this, just as we have always done with `assert!()`. The only thing not vending a macro will do is encourage people to use `assert!()` even when disabling the assert will lead to a critical safety hole in their code.\n",

    "body": "So, just to put it out there, I've been floating this idea around: instead of allocating a macro name for the \"always on\" assert, one could follow [Perl's example](http://perldesignpatterns.com/?ErrorHandling):\n\n```\n#[allow(deprecated_owned_vector)]\nfn main() {\n    ::std::os::args().len() == 2 || fail!(\"require exactly one argument\");\n    println!(\"arg: {}\", ::std::os::args()[1]);\n}\n```\n\nI had thought we would need to put in a special case into our \"unused value\" lint to deal with this, but apparently it works without any warnings right out of the box:\n\n```\n% rustc /tmp/die.rs\n% ./die  hello\narg: hello\n% ./die  hello there\ntask '<main>' failed at 'require exactly one argument', /tmp/die.rs:3\n% \n```\n\n(True, this requires the user to spell out what the condition was that they were checking.  But that might be a pro, since one probably wants to control how much their code gets bloated by the output strings for this construct.)\n\nAnyway, this pattern means we _could_ just make `assert!` behave like `debug_assert!`, and stop worrying about what to name the other case (since it can be written very succinctly inline).\n",
