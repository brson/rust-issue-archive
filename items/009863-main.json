  "body": "Hello,\n\nFirst time rust contributor here, please let me know if I need to sort out the contribution agreement for this.\n\nI picked issue #9755 to dip my toe in the water, this pull request isn't quite complete though as I have not updated the documentation. The reason for this is that I haven't tracked down why this feature is gated so I don't feel I can write a justification of the same quality as the other features have been documented.\nIf someone would like to explain or point me at a mail thread I am happy to update with this change.\n\nHopefully I have understood the process of converting the old flag into a directive correctly.\n\nAlso just to call out what I am sure if a known quirk when adding feature directives, you can't build this code unless you have a snapshot of the compiler which knows about the feature directive. Chicken and the egg. I split the change into two commits, the first should be able to build a snapshot that can compile the second.\n",
