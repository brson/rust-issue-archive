    "body": "These conversions are actually intentionally remaining and are destined to become stable one day (not sure we've had the right revision to the RFC yet). The plan is to add _explicit_ conversions between types (for example `.as_slice`, `.as_os_str`, `.as_bytes`, etc), in addition to `AsRef` implementations (where possible). These methods are very rarely used today, and most uses can be subsumed by deref coercions, but the convention is more widely applicable to other types (for example `Path` does not deref to `OsStr` but converting to one is done via `.as_os_str`).\n\nI believe that @aturon is working on a PR to shard the global \"core\" feature, and hopefully these will be dealt with as a part of that!\n",
