If we add this distinction, however, then we could get the same wins on dylibs as we're getting on executables.\n\nI'd also recommend avoiding editing github comments, unfortunately no notifications are sent out after an edit...\n",

If the native library is compiled with `dllexport` then it'll still continue to be exported, and if it wasn't compiled with `dllexport` it will continue to not be exported.\n\nLLVM doesn't support a mode of being built with `dllexport`, so we used a custom `*.def` file to export them previously, but the linker only accepts one `*.def` file and now that the compiler is providing its own we needed a mechanism for the compiler to emit those symbols as well.\n\nIn short, this doesn't actually change the story for any native library linked into an MSVC binary today. It still sucks that you have to remember to `dllexport` it yourself if you know it's going to be called through a DLL, but that's true both before and after this PR.\n",
