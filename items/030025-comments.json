The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "I really hoped that I could fix this elsewhere, but while parsing the trait, we're filling the [parser's](https://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/syntax/parse/parser/struct.Parser.html) `expected_tokens` vector with the things we expect (`const`, `fn`, etc.), and so it finally throws the error before the bump (before even consuming the semicolon, I guess). So, we check for the trailing case explicitly and bump again if needed (which is issue-specific and perhaps, not the clean way).\n\nI also guess that the real issue is behind [`real_tokens`](https://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/src/syntax/parse/lexer/mod.rs.html#41-52), where the `DocComment`s aren't checked. I'm not sure about the reason, but even if we include the case there, we can't emit an error for these cases.\n",

    "body": "So, I'll summarize the problem I'm experiencing right now.\n\n1) `struct`: This is okay, because it was simple enough to add another match arm to check whether we're parsing a `DocComment`\n\n2) `enum`: Currently, [we're looping](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/29ea4eef9fa6e36f40bc1f31eb1e56bf5941ee72/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L5281) over the tokens until we encounter a closing brace. So, even if we skip on the first doc comment, there's no way for us to know whether the next one's an expected token or not, because there could be a series of doc comments, just like @nagisa said.\n\n3) `trait`: While parsing the traits, [we use a closure](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/29ea4eef9fa6e36f40bc1f31eb1e56bf5941ee72/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L1220) that consumes the final closing brace (which is sent to a looping function), which means we have the same problem of not knowing what's in the future.\n\n4) `impl`: Just like the last two, [we loop until we get a closing brace](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/29ea4eef9fa6e36f40bc1f31eb1e56bf5941ee72/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L4755), same problem.\n\nEven if we add a flag to the parser to ignore the doc comments all the time (except those areas checked by the lint), the problem remains unchanged (except that it will be a \"when to _enable_ the doc comments check\" instead of \"when to _ignore_ them\"). Any ideas people?\n",
