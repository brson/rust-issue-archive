    "body": "The issue is that you don't have the option of creating an empty vector at all, without an extra branch on every operation (indexing, checking size, etc.) like you end up doing with `OptVec`. It makes sense to pay that price for the benefits of a small vector, but not for empty ones.\n\nBefore:\n\n```\nlet mut xs = ~[]; // allocates space for 4 elements\nxs.push(4);\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```\nlet mut xs = ~[]; // data pointer is null\nxs.push(4); // allocates space for 4 elements\n```\n\nThe allocation would just happen when you first push instead of at the declaration, so there wouldn't be no performance hit compared to the current situation. You always have the option of using `with_capacity` or `reserve` too.\n",

    "body": "This is _somewhat_ orthogonal to DST since we have already decided that there would be special representations for `&[]` and `&str` as compared to `&T` for some other T. This is ok because of monomorphization, though it does mean that one cannot cast a DST like `[]` to an object (that is `&[]` cannot be cast to an object `&Foo` even if `[]` implements `Foo`). The problem there is that objects must be manipulable without knowing the precise receiver type, so they must always be a single pointer.\n\nHowever, thinking on this a bit harder, if we could preserve the invariant that `~T` is always 1 word _except_ for objects (that is, `~Foo` is two words), we _might_ be able to lift the object restriction, though it'd require some cleverness. The idea is that if you have a type like `&[]` that you cast to `&Foo`, we could actually create a temporary and store a pointer to the temporary. This is ok if the lifetime of the `&Foo` is short enough. Actually that's pretty yucky, because it would mean that you couldn't cast an `&'a []` to a `&'a Foo` for all `'a`, since some of those lifetimes might exceed the current stack frame. Moreover it'd require some tricky footwork in trans to deal with the extra deref. So scratch that idea. Rather I'm inclined to say that casting `pointer-T` to an object requires that `T` be sized.\n\nGiven that restriction, I believe we are free to represent `pointer-DST` in whatever ways we prefer.\n",
