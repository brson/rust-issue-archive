    "body": "@zzmp I think you should just open a separate PR to fix it.\n\nFWIW, I just looked a bit, and the current code is relying on the `keyCode` property of the event. As far as I'm aware, this is a platform- and implementation-dependent value. For example, in Safari on my computer, both slash (`/`) and question mark (`?`) have the `keyCode` of `191` (with the `shiftKey` to distinguish them). The code right now is looking for `188`.\n\nIt seems that on IE and Firefox, the proper solution is to use the `key` property, and on Safari and Chrome, the proper solution is to use the `keyIdentifier` property (of the `originalEvent`; apparently JQuery doesn't bother surfacing that up onto its wrapper object). For the latter, the expected value for `?` is `U+003F`. For the former, I'm not sure, you can test on Firefox to find out.\n\nI'm actually vaguely surprised that `s` works in Safari.\n\nI'm also surprised JQuery doesn't apparently abstract this away for you.\n",
