Testing a function that has 1000 times this:\n\n``` rust\nif x > 0 { let _y = 0 } else { let _y = 0 }\n```\n\nThe pass can't optimize those because of the `let` statements, and there's no time change for the MIR dump, both with and without the pass, it takes about 11-12ms.\n\nUsing 1000 of this instead:\n\n``` rust\nif x > 0 {} else {}\n```\n\nThe pass can drop a ton of empty blocks. Again, the MIR dump time is pretty much unchanged at 5ms, but since the MIR is reduced so much, LLVM passes drop from 16ms to 10ms. So a net win of 6ms.\n\nAnd the MIR as we currently build it has so many empty blocks that we really should run this pass once even when optimizations are off. \n",
