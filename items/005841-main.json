  "body": "Fix #3499.\n\nThis is a work in progress.\n\n`T ^ N` (temporary syntax) parses to `ast::ty_multi(@Ty, uint)` and converts to `ty::ty_multi(t, uint)` and lowers to LLVM SIMD vector type `<n x t>`. Metadata support and reflection support are missing. There are minimal tests.\n\nCasting scalar to vector broadcasts, and element-wise vector arithmetics is implemented. There should be a way to load from vectors to SIMD vector (since terminology is confusing, let's call this \"multi\"), which needs design.\n\nSome TODOs are OpenCL-style swizzling, type conversion, more SIMD operations (such as saturated arithmetics), etc.\n",
