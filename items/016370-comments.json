    "body": "For the fractions, I think `PI_OVER_TWO` would be more appropriate. They would have to be changed in `Float` as well. But what is the advantage of these fractions anyway? If you write `Float::pi() / 2.0`, the compiler should be able to create the constant at compile time, right? And `pi() / 2.0` is shorter than `frac_pi_2()` (or one character longer if you need parentheses around it). I did a search on GitHub, and `frac_pi_2` is only used in 16 places (excluding the definition, tests and wrappers). `frac_pi_6()` is not used anywhere except for the definition and tests, on GitHub at least. `FRAC_2_PI` is not used either.\n\nFor `LOG2_E`, the 2 there is part of the function name. I think the underscore separating the function and argument is fine if `SQRT2` is renamed to `SQRT_2`.\n\nEdit: Actually, having `PI_OVER_TWO` and `SQRT_2` is not consistent either ... It could be `HALF_PI`, and `FRAC_1_SQRT2` could be renamed to `HALF_SQRT_2` (because `sqrt(2)/2 = 1/sqrt(2)`), but there would still be names with digits and names without. Any ideas?\n",

I agree with @kballard that we need to consider the naming of these constants in a more global way, since the current names are meant to reflect the names in C. We're going through a \"stabilization\" process where we mark `libstd` APIs with [stability attributes](http://doc.rust-lang.org/rust.html#stability), and the float data types are one of the next targets.\n\nIf you'd like to help with this effort, you could start a thread on [discuss](http://discuss.rust-lang.org/) with a broader proposal and rationale. Otherwise, the team will be dealing with floats soon and we'll take this inconsistency into account.\n\nI'm going to close the PR for now, but thanks for bringing this to our attention!\n",
