    "body": "Does `cargo install git://github.com/blah/blah HEAD` and adding `ref: \"HEAD\"` to packages.json not add that functionality, or am I missing something? Cargo is still terribly out-dated at the moment and is still rolling-release, so I'm afraid there's not much you can do right now.\n\nEDIT: Oh, I see. You want to add a command line option that manually details that you want the latest HEAD. No, you can't do that yet. I think it's a good idea, but it might be better to just add versions instead.\n",
