More specifically, we still _do_ the inference, and the type system only considers its results, it doesn't really look at what you declared. (@msullivan this is what I was hoping you could fix with the remaining time :) )\n\nAnother case where this crops up is a type like:\n\n```\nfn<'a>(fn(x: &'a T))\n```\n\nwhich is in fact treated by our system currently as:\n\n```\nfn(fn<'a>(x: &'a T))\n```\n\nbecause that is what the old inference would have decided.\n",
