  "body": "Implement multidispatch and conditional dispatch. Because we do not attempt to preserve crate concatenation, this is a backwards compatible change. This is not yet fully integrated into method dispatch, so \"UFCS\"-style wrappers must be used to take advantage of the new features (see the run-pass tests).\n\ncc #17307 (multidispatch)\ncc #5527 (trait reform -- conditional dispatch)\n\nBecause we no longer preserve crate concatenability, this deviates slightly from what was specified in the RFC. The motivation for this change is described in [this blog post](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2014/09/30/multi-and-conditional-dispatch-in-traits/). I will post an amendment to the RFC in due course but do not anticipate great controversy on this point -- particularly as the RFCs more important features (e.g., conditional dispatch) just don't work without the change.\n",
