    "body": "This is correct behavior.\n\n`line` is of type `Result<String>`, `unwrap()` moves `line` and returns an owned `String`. `trim()` takes a reference to that `String` and returns a reference to it (an `&str`). But that unbound String is dropped when the `lines.unwrap.trim();` expression ends, because it has not been bound to a variable. You cannot take a reference to a value unless that value is bound for the entire scope that the reference exists for.\n\nYou can read more about how this works in [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ownership.html).\n",
