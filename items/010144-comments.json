This should probably be split into separate type per-kind (`SendMimic`, `FreezeMimic`) because it's not going to make sense for `Sized`.\n",

    "body": "This seems like a sensible approach. I had originally thought to couple the pointer and the kind translations -- that is, replace the `*T` that appears in `Rc<T>` with something like `IndirectPtr<T>`, that would be a `*T` but would be specially understood by the kind checker in a similar fashion to `KindMimic`. This seemed like it would fit in with `Raw<T>` as a possible future replacement for `*T`. But I think I prefer your solution, since it decouples the representation of the pointer from the type checker concerns. Overall I am not pleased that smart pointers require such a deep understanding of language concerns, but I guess this is somewhat inevitable.\n\nI suspect we will need a few variations on `KindMimic` -- at least 2. If you see #10158 you can see that I broke down the translations for pointers into two categories, `owned_pointer` and `other_pointer` (used for managed, indirect). This is because some properties only matter if they are owned, and others matter if they are reachable. I guess `KindMimic` corresponds to `other_pointer` (or should).\n\nAlso -- can we not use the name `kind`? I've been trying to move us to the term \"builtin bounds\" because the term \"kind\" has a pre-existing usage (higher-kinded types).\n",
