    "body": "I think all containers should implement ordering as a lexicographic comparison. There are separate methods for checking for a subset / superset already, and we would lose the nice `O(n)` worst-case lexicographic comparisons on `TreeSet`. I don't understand why lexicographic comparisons are \"crazy\" semantics, as it's what I expect for all ordered containers. It would be very surprising if Rust's implementation was different than the C++ standard library, and would lead to bugs based on an assumption of a familiar implementation.\n",
