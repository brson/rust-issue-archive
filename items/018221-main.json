  "body": "Explain that Rust has different pointer types because there is a\ntradeoff between flexibility and efficiency. Briefly explain what a call\nstack is, since people coming from scripting languages may be\nunfamiliar. Explain that stack variables can't outlive their function,\nwhich motivates storing things in the heap. Briefly explain the heap,\nand the advantages of Rust's approach to it. Clarify that boxes are\npointer types that you deref with \\* just like references. Scope isn't\nthe most accurate framework to think about deallocation (since you\nreturn boxes and otherwise move values out of scopes); it's more \"when\nthe value is done being used,\" i.e., lifetime. Provide a connection\nbetween Rust's pointer types by locating them on a flexibiltiy /\nperformance scale. Explain the compiler can't statically analyze\nlifetimes with multiple referrers; hence the need for (runtime)\nreference counting.\n",
