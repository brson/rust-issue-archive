  "body": "They all have to go into a single module at the moment unfortunately.\nIdeally, the logging macros would live in std::logging, condition! would\nlive in std::condition, format! in std::fmt, etc. However, this\nintroduces cyclic dependencies between those modules and the macros they\nuse which the current expansion system can't deal with. We may be able\nto get around this by changing the expansion phase to a two-pass system\nbut that's for a later PR.\n\nCloses #2247\ncc #11763\n",
