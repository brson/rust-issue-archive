    "body": "Thanks for getting out the bikeshed color swatches; I wasn't really sure about the name/location.\n\nThis was actually called `uniq` when I first wrote it, but then I went looking for something a little less Unixy and saw C++'s `unique`, which is similar (but not quite the same, because it's generic over forward iterators and observably copies elements and requires the caller to delete the excess space).  I do agree that overloading the word \u201cunique\u201d is bad.\n\nAs for other suggestions: Rust aesthetics tend to favor short and/or single-word names where feasible, and that .NET \u201cdistinct\u201d removes all duplicates regardless of order, which matches what \u201cdistinct\u201d means in SQL and math (well, and what \u201cunique\u201d normally means, but that didn't stop C++ or Unix).  I think \u201cdedup\u201d might be the suggestion with the least against it, even though I typically see that word used to mean some kind of interning/hash-consing.\n",
