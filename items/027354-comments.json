If you ask various questions like \"give me the components of this path\" or \"are these two paths equal?\" you'll get answers based on a small amount of normalization.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let base = PathBuf::from(\"/some/path\");\n    let relative = PathBuf::from(\"./some/relative/path\");\n    let path = base.join(relative);\n    println!(\"{:?}\", path);\n}\n```\n\nI'm going to close this as working-as-intended.
