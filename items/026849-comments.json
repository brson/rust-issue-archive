In the ideal world we'd fix `extend` + `take` and then add a regression test that it always turns into a memset, but I realize that may be difficult. Regardless I agree with @nikomatsakis that I'd at least like to see comparison numbers to see how much of a difference this makes.\n",

    "body": "This PR came out of a post here: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/reading-from-stdin-performance/2025 .  The difference is pretty severe - for the shootout reverse-complement test we're talking maybe 15-20% of the total runtime is taken up by zeroing of a buffer for a read in file.  It's about 10x slower to 0-init a Vec by extend vs memset.\n\nIf the sentiment is against adding small hacks like this, I'd favour either (if it's reasonably achievable) making extend optimise appropriately as soon as possible, or adding a simpler method to vec for Copy data that will optimise more reliably (see https://users.rust-lang.org/t/reading-from-stdin-performance/2025/13?u=alisdairo ).  I realise that we probably don't want to pollute Vec with too many methods, but the inability to safely 0-init/extend a buffer with reasonable performance is a pretty bad black eye for a lot of performance sensitive work - _especially_ in a world where we avoid use of uninitialised buffers.\n",

I can understand reluctance about over-polluting Vec, but I think there's a not-so-terrible argument even in the absence of a performance improvement - which is that the ergonomics of extend are not especially great for simple initialisation.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the simpler code is clearly easier for the compiler to optimise, making it possible to avoid building up hacks in the codebase to work around it.\n",
