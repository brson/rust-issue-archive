    "body": "Hm, this could get interesting. So in theory the signature of the type_id intrinsic is `fn type_id<T: 'static>() -> u64`, but this means that callers need to have a `'static` bound, which `Any` currently does not, and apparently you can't make `trait Foo: 'static`.\n\nThis also seems a little limiting to the `Any` trait to make it only applicable for types which don't have any borrowed pointers inside of them. It looks like the types that we're hashing aren't necessarily the \"trans types\" in that they've had all their regions substituted, so why can't we hash the regions as well? You could have some possibly equivalent types have different types, but I think that it's fine to have that happen (especially when lots of weird regions are involved).\n",

Collisions are fairly unlikely unless you are specifically looking for one, but, if collisions can be found they can also happen by accident. Is this an problem? I didn't want to open up an issue until someone that understands the impacts of such a collision better than I do took a look and I wasn't sure where else to post.\n",
