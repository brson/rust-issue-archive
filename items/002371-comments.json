    "body": "Actually I'm wondering if both names aren't wrong.  One problem I'm finding in practice is that if all impls have the same name, it's hard to sort out what you want to use and what you want to export.  \n\nHere is the scenario I'm talking about:\n\n```\nimport result::{result, methods}; // something I use\n\nexport foo, methods;\n\ntype foo = ...;\nimpl methods for foo { ... }\n```\n\nI am wondering if it wouldn't be better to name the impl after the type in question.  Then you could (easily) export just the methods for your type and not others, and you can use a type and its methods by doing:\n\n```\nimport some_type::some_type;\n```\n\nAll that said, I suppose that #1893 addresses this too:\n\n```\nimport result::{result, methods}; // something I use\n\npub type foo = ...;\npub impl methods for foo { ... }\n```\n\nThat's another benefit of #1893 I hadn't considered.\n\nSo I don't know, maybe `methods` is best after all---anyhow, just tossing this out there.\n",
