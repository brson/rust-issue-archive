If I treat both sides of a swap the same way I would treat the RHS of an assignment, then the compiler won't print a warning for this program. Arguably that's wrong -- x and y are both swapped, but neither is actually, used.\n\nOTOH, if others think that a conservative approximation (not warning for the above case) is acceptable, I'm ok with doing the simplest thing.
