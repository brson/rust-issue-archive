  "body": "This removes the feature where newtype structs can be dereferenced like pointers, and likewise where certain enums can be dereferenced (which I imagine nobody realized still existed). This ad-hoc behavior is to be replaced by a more general overloadable dereference trait in the future.\n\nI've been nursing this patch for two months and think it's about rebased up to master.\n\n@nikomatsakis this makes a bunch of your type checking code noticeably uglier.\n",
