I know @alexcrichton and @nikomatsakis have discussed this a bit more. As far as I can tell, the reasoning behind this change makes sense to me. Probably we need a new type ?\n",

    "body": "Even the unwrap method of sending a `T` is outlawed by the reasoning in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20257#issuecomment-144559276 (one can't unwrap while there's another existing `Arc<T>`).\n\n> Stack overflow! One too many uses of double negatives! Can you rephrase this?\n\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20257#issuecomment-144559276 implies that the `Clone` reasoning isn't problematic with the concurrency APIs we currently have (AFAIK), e.g. with the basic scoped threads, sending a reference to an `Arc` will mean the thing that reference points to will have to outlive the thread itself:\n\n``` rust\nlet x = Arc::new(1);\n\nlet guard = thread::scoped(|| {\n    let y = x.clone();\n});\n\n// illegal, since `x` is still borrowed by `guard`\ndrop(x);\n```\n\n`y`'s destructor will never touch the `1`, since `x` won't be destroyed until strictly after the thread has finished, so the reference count when will never be small when `y` is manipulating it.\n\nHowever, it may be possible to have a fancier API that does allow transferring a reference to a new thread, doing something with it, and then \"releasing\" any borrows while keeping some data on the new thread (some sort of partial scoped API, maybe).\n",
