    "body": "Nominating.\n\nOn reflection, I believe part of the idea of RFC 59 is that we can safely switch from our current semantics to a multi-dispatch on input type parameters semantics in a backwards compatible fashion (since I think any code that worked before will continue to work under the new semantics ...)\n\n... except perhaps there may be type inference issues?  I am not sure about whether there are such issues, and even if they are, I am not sure whether we let type inference issues of this sort be backward compatibility blockers.\n\nSo I'm going to take a stab in the dark and nominate for P-high, not 1.0.\n\n(N.B. It is the traits with type params that should be _output_ associated types that are a backwards compatibility hazard; see #17826.)\n",
