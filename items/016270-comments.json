    "body": "Whoops, seems this is not such a good idea after all.  The code size reduction is only about 0.2% on average, and there's a slight performance penalty.\n\nTurns out LLVM likes to fiddle with calling conventions on `internal` functions to get better performance.  Changing to `available_externally` linkage prevents it from doing so.  LLVM also makes different inlining decisions based on the calling convention being used.\n\nI think we still ought to do something like this in the future, but rustc would probably need to be a little bit more clever about choosing calling conventions.  (Also, we would probably get more code size savings by focusing on monomorphizations and drop/visit glue instead of #[inline] functions, but that would be more complicated to implement.)\n",

    "body": "@epdtry: This is a good idea. At `-O0` and `-O1`, only `always(inline)` functions are inlined. The code would perform better if it called out to better optimized functions in the libraries. You don't need to worry about the calling convention, because we could just be using `fastcc` for Rust rather than the C calling convention - our ABI is way less stable than `fastcc`.\n",
