It's messy, and we can let boundary checks or `.reserve()` do the work most of the time. However we may need a better plan. What do we really want to do for the `v.reserve(X + Y)` case. Ignore the overflow in addition and handle it in bounds checks? Change the \"size_t\" type to something that always uses checked addition?\n",

    "body": "Rebased to avoid conflicts (new name of `Option::unwrap_or`).\n\nI changed `.reserve_additional` to check the vec capacity before doing anything; I think this is an improvement that puts the failure case (in this case overflow) inside a branch that is only taken seldomly.\n\nI changed `vec::bytes::push_bytes` to not use `.mut_slice()` but to use `ptr::copy_memory` directly. As the commit log says, It's good to avoid overhead and use a tad more unsafe code since much of `str` will depend on this function.\n\nWith these changes, it looks like the `StrVector` method `.connect()` is faster with its safe implementation on top of the change series, than its unsafe implementation before.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm benchmarking this correctly. It could be that .connect() just optimizes to the point of invalidating the benchmark with the changes, but that's a win in itself..\n\nwith local `rustc --opt-level=3 -Z no-monomorphic-collapse --test  std.rs`\n\n```\nbefore\ntest str::bench::bench_connect ... bench: 333 ns/iter (+/- 2)\ntest str::bench::bench_push_str ... bench: 163 ns/iter (+/- 4)\n\nafter\ntest str::bench::bench_connect ... bench: 178 ns/iter (+/- 3)\ntest str::bench::bench_push_str ... bench: 162 ns/iter (+/- 2)\n```\n\nI'm not sure if the benchmarks should stay in the PR, but apart from that I think this change is ready for review & merge.\n",
