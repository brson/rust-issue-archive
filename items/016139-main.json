  "body": "Before this commit, the LLVM IR of exported items was simply zip-compressed and stored as an object file inside rlib archives. This commit adds a header to this \"object\" containing a file identifier and a format version number so the compiler can deal with changes in the way bytecode objects are stored within rlibs.\n\nWhile updating the format of bytecode objects, this commit also worksaround a problem in LLDB which could not handle odd-sized objects within archives before mid-2014.\n\nFixes #15950.\n",
