    "body": "This looks like a very large change to the compiler, and I'm not sure there has been much discussion on this topic.\n\nFor large changes such as this, we require an RFC in the [rust-lang/rfcs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) repo. The [first RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/active/0001-rfc-process.md) explains the process of how to submit an RFC.\n\nI don't mean to dissuade you from this work, it looks awesome! Discussion for a change such as this should start outside of a PR, however.\n",
