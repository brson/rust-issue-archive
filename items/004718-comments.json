    "body": "This code is unsound because the `spawn` closures are making incorrect copies of the ports and channels as in #4679. Mapping those pairs from `&(Port, Chan)` to `Port` looks buggy too. Neither `Port` nor `Chan` are copyable types, so they must be moved around (or shared and cloned with `SharedChan`). I expect this not to compile on incoming, but I am interested in whether or not an adapted version continues to exhibit problems.\n",
