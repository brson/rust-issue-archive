  "body": "[Apparently](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2015-12-11-swift-weak-references.html) Swift does this:\n\n> When a weak reference is loaded, the runtime checks the target's state. If the target is a zombie, then it zeroes the weak reference, decrements the weak reference count, and returns nil.\n\nIn our world, this would mean `Weak` would store a `Cell`, which would be `set` to null in `upgrade()` if the strong count was found to be zero. This could allow the allocation to be freed earlier than it otherwise would be. I'm not sure if it would be a significant pessimization in any other respects?\n\n(I just checked what other operations are available on `Weak` - this could also potentially be done in `clone()`.)\n",
