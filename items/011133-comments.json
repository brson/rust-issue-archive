    "body": "Isn't the reason having 'unwrap' everywhere is a smell is because it ignores the safety net Option gives you and risks task failure everywhere it's used?   This does the exact same thing but seems to bless it with special syntax.  \n\nAt least when you have to type out the full 'unwrap()' method you're having to work a little bit for it, and it's clear from it's ugliness that it should maybe be avoided.  From an affordance standpoint, it seems unfortunate that the 'wrong' thing (just fail) is easier to reach for than the 'right' thing (generate a default or otherwise handle the error), so maybe it should even be a little uglier, and all Option methods that can fail should be removed, forcing you to write out `let a = foo.unwrap_or_else(|| fail()!)` every time.  \n\nIf there's going to be special handling for Option or other Unwrappables, it should take the form of something like do-notation or Option chaining.\n",

    "body": "@jfager There are many `.unwrap()` in rust source repository. Are they all misusage? I don't think so. This is a common usage, authors need it, they ensure got Some(T) not None in that situation, and even fail! is acceptable. Are you like code full of `let a = foo.unwrap_or_else(|| fail()!)` everywhere? `match` need at least 4 lines.\n",
