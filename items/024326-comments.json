Because of the orphan rules, the only crate which can implement `+` for unsafe ptrs is `libcore`. It doesn't and won't, intentionally.\n\nAnyway, adding a lang-item that makes `+` unsafe is RFC territory, and is currently a part of rust-lang/rfcs#420. \n",

    "body": "> Surely by rust's logic, pointer arithmetic is not unsafe, for the same reason that converting a reference to a pointer is not unsafe:\n\nIt's unsafe because rustc uses the LLVM inbounds attribute and LLVM says that invalid pointer arithmetic with this attribute is UB even if the pointer is never used afterwards.\n\nEdit: I guess this only applies if you use the offset intrinsic but the offset intrinsic supposedly enables more optimizations compared to `as usize + 1) as *mut T`.\n\n> Rust is meant to be used with libcore\n\nI'm using it without libcore.\n",
