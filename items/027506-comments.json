    "body": "First of all, neither of them are supposed to be builders. `with_extension` returns another `PathBuf` for a reason: `Path` is a functional equivalent of slice, therefore you cannot resize the underlying buffer to accommodate for all possible new extensions. `set_extension` returns `bool` because it needs to tell you whether it could set the extension at all (as documentation claims; I personally think it should\u2019ve been Result<(), ()> or something). \n\nSince `PathBuf` auto-derefs to `Path`, you can easily do something like\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", PathBuf::from(\"hello.md\").with_extension(\"html\"))\n}\n```\n\ntherefore there\u2019s no convenience loss either?\n",
