The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @Manishearth (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@Manishearth Sorry, I haven't been able to work on it much since last week. Work is crunch time this week. I hope to have time after that.\n\nGiven that the correct way of doing this is unrelated to the way I did it previously, should I revert those changes and continue to use this PR or create a new one? It seems like the git history would be cleaner if I created a new one, but I know that in the typical case it's better to reuse the existing PR.\n\nThanks.\n",
