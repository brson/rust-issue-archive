    "body": "I personally don't believe that the format-string format should not be conforming to what rust as a language uses as a string format. I believe that if we start recognizing `\\n` as an escape sequence, then it will start to just lead to confusion.\n\nWhat I do think, however, is that the error message could be improved in this case. It's no clear that the error is coming from the format string parser and not the rust string parser, and I believe that distinction would alleviate the problem.\n",
