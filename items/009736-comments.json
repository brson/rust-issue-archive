    "body": "Current status: the test is failing on linux2, but if I ssh into rust-linux1 and run `make check` with this branch, all tests pass. Something must be different on linux2. The test that fails is a weird test that should be rewritten anyway (it's one of the two that do probably-non-threadsafe things), but I still want to understand why it fails. I'm pinging Graydon to try to find out whether I can ssh into linux2.\n",
