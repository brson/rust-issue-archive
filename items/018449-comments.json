Adding a period does suggest it's less likely to be misspelled (because methods sometimes are cryptic) but doesn't point toward what it might mean unless you already know.\n\nI would probably just link to wikipedia or expand it in place to `read-only data` or `rodata (read-only data)`. A search of the repository only shows one other hit of `rodata` so it's not commonly used term in rust docs. So, it's probably not critical that everyone understands the term.\n",
