    "body": "@brson, see my PR #34254.\n\nReasons to keep the man pages:\n1. The man pages are there, removing them is a bit of lost work then. If they're not desired because of Windows, then creating them should've been given more thought at the outset.\n2. I think they are expected by users on Unix for utilities with so many command line options, such as `rustc`. Having them can be considered necessary for feature parity with `gcc`, `ocamlc`, basically any popular compiler.\n\nI agree that writing man pages manually is undesirable. Have you seen [Docker Engine's man page production workflow](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/9a8affb0ffdf6010fca6a1c8fb00c9e0a38845d6/man/README.md)? I personally would prefer that you'd start using [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#man-pages), since that's basically the best OSS technical documentation system around, and it can render man pages as well as DocBook, responsive (X)HTML5, PDF, etc.\n\nWhat about thinking differently, not along the lines of superseding the man pages with \u2018the published documentation\u2019 but rather considering them part of \u2018the documentation\u2019 and accounted for as such.\n",

    "body": "The recent man page work on cargo first used ASCIIDOC, but we rejected it in favor of keeping the consistency of Markdown everywhere.\n\nOn Jun 13, 2016, 10:28 +0200, Sander Maijersnotifications@github.com, wrote:\n\n> @brson(https://github.com/brson), see my PR#34254(https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34254).\n> \n> Reasons to keep the man pages:\n> 1. The man pages are there, removing them is a bit of lost work then. If they're not desired because of Windows, then creating them should've been given more thought at the outset.\n> 2. I think they are expected by users on Unix for utilities with so many command line options, such asrustc. Having them can be considered necessary for feature parity withgcc,ocamlc, basically any popular compiler.\n> \n> I agree that writing man pages manually is undesirable. Have you seenDocker Engine's man page production workflow(https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/9a8affb0ffdf6010fca6a1c8fb00c9e0a38845d6/man/README.md)? I personally would prefer that you'd start usingAsciidoctor(http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#man-pages), since that basically the best OSS technical documentation system around, and it can render man pages as well as DocBook, responsive (X)HTML5, PDF, etc.\n> \n> What about thinking differently, not along the lines of superseding the man pages with \u2018the published documentation\u2019 but rather considering them part of \u2018the documentation\u2019 and accounted for as such.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly,view it on GitHub(https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25689#issuecomment-225518157), ormute the thread(https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AABsis_n8P2KaCfeaJbJ_rGiy_a6v66bks5qLRSUgaJpZM4Ej8Rp).\n",
