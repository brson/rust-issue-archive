    "body": "This adds a new assumption to compiletest that when host != target then we require special cases to run the tests. This is not true though for x86_64 vs. i686 - we do cross compile from x86_64 to i686 and then run the tests on the host platform. The effect of this patch will be that the i686 tests never get run on the bots. Likewise the tests for `CFG_RUNNABLE_*` appear to disable the i686 tests on x86_64.\n\nPerhaps instead of using host and target, we can just base the decision to use adb on whether the adb_path is provided, and/or on whether the target is android.\n\nThe 'runnable' flag to compiletest is supposed to indicate whether adb is available and, if it isn't, just compile the tests but not run them. I think this may be too clever, resulting in situations where it _looks_ like you've tested your code but actually haven't (e.g. it looks like i686 is being tested but it isn't). Can we possibly make it so that adb is required to test android?\n\nAll four of the new compiletest flags seem to be used to decide the question 'should I use adb to run the tests?'. That could be indicated with a single flag instead of four, though admittedly that wouldn't be as general a solution.\n",
