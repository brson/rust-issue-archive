    "body": "I was at Bloomberg last year, and I found https://github.com/bloomberg/bde/wiki/BDE-Allocator-Model to be extremely powerful, and potentially something to model Rust's allocators after.\n\nPros: Where your memory comes from is very explicit. It makes it very easy to do things such as hierarchical allocators. For example, having a bump allocator allocate its memory out of an arena of bump allocators which allocates its memory out of the stack. Writing code that only uses stack in inner-loops becomes possible, and I've seen very little code like it outside of that company.\n\nCons: Where your memory comes from is very explicit. Basically every struct that can allocate memory gains a new `Allocator` pointer. It works pretty well in large, homogeneous C++ codebases, but maybe rust can do something smarter here. I don't like having to add that field myself, every time, but I also wouldn't like for my structs to gain implicit fields. There is a relatively large design space here to explore.\n",

    "body": "> Basically every struct that can allocate memory gains a new Allocator pointer\n\nThe precise details of this isn't quite true. Every struct that can allocate memory would gain a new field like (for illustration purposes):\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo<A: Allocator> {\n    // ...\n\n    alloc: A\n}\n```\n\ni.e. not required to be a pointer. Also, Rust has well-defined zero-sized types, so one can substitute in something like `struct CAlloc;`that just calls `malloc`/`free`, and `struct Jemalloc;` calling jemalloc's routines. If someone does have an allocator that needs to be behind a pointer (for size or for shared data), they're free to do that as part of the implementation details of it.\n\n(Just glancing at the BDE API now, it seems like it would be preferable for Rust to expose an API like [jemalloc's experimental API](http://www.canonware.com/download/jemalloc/jemalloc-latest/doc/jemalloc.html#idm171718063456), where e.g. `malloc` returns the true usable size of the allocations, and you can request some optional extra size for `realloc`s, etc.)\n\n---\n\nFWIW, #4252 is now closed, so it's probably possible to start experimenting with this seriously.\n",

You could also pass null (which the parameter defaults to), in which case it uses the global allocator. But either way, it doesn't store the allocator itself - only a pointer to it. This might be hard to replicate in rust (with memory safety and all), but using a reference counted pointer might be appropriate for this.\n",
