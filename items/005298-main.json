  "body": "Revamp foreign code not to consider the Rust modes.  This requires\nadjusting a few foreign functions that were declared with by-ref\nmode.  This also allows us to remove by-val mode in the near future.\n\nWith copy mode, though, we have to be careful because Rust will implicitly pass\nsomethings by pointer but this may not be the C ABI rules.  For example, rust\nwill pass a `struct Foo` as a `Foo*`.  So I added some code into the adapters to\nfix this (though the C ABI rules may put the pointer back, oh well).\n\nThis patch also includes a lint mode for the use of by-ref mode\nin foreign functions as the semantics of this have changed.\n\nr? @brson\n",
