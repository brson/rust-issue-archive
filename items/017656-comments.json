Xxhash has two parts at its core.\n- the inner loop that consumes 32 bytes at a time\n- the finalizer\n\nFor 8 byte chunks, it does only the following:\n\n``` rust\nlet total_len = 8;\nlet mut h64 = self.seed + PRIME5 + total_len;\n\nlet mut k1: u64 = source * PRIME2;\nk1 = rotl64(k1, 31);\nk1 *= PRIME1;\nh64 ^= k1;\nh64 = rotl64(h64, 27) * PRIME1 + PRIME4;\n\nh64 ^= h64 >> 33;\nh64 *= PRIME2;\nh64 ^= h64 >> 29;\nh64 *= PRIME3;\nh64 ^= h64 >> 32;\nreturn h64;\n```\n\nHowever, the finalizer alone is responsible for avalanche properties and can be used with chunks that have exactly 8 bytes:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut hash = source;\nhash ^= hash >> 33;\nhash *= PRIME2;\nhash ^= hash >> 29;\nhash *= PRIME3;\nhash ^= hash >> 32;\nreturn hash;\n```\n",
