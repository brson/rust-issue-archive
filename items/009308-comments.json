    "body": "It's been my impression that there's some redundancy in other error messages too, and I figured that was desirable. For example, unknown identifiers, wrong types or unexpected tokens also seem to get reproduced in the error messages in some context.\n\nI might have overdone it with reproducing whole block comments and string literals, but at that point I was mainly going for consistency with the errors for erroneous numeric literals or escape sequences which I felt were reasonable.\n\nA test for unterminated comments seemed useless to me since by virtue of extending to eof, they don't leave anywhere to put the \"error should happen here\" annotation, so there's just the fact that an error happens.\n\nDo you think I should drop the code-in-error-message for unterminated strings, comments and doc comments, but leave it in for the other cases?\n\nHere's the lexer errors for the test cases, for reference: http://ix.io/8ag (the span for the last one is displayed wrong presumably because of #8706, but it reproduces the unterminated character constant in the error message just fine, so it's correct in the lexer)\n",

    "body": "I would remove the verbose error messages about the numeric literals and comments, but I think that the ones in reference to the tokens are fine.\n\nIn general if a message just spits back what it highlights, then it's probably not necessary to have it (in my opinion), so for things like type errors it makes sense because you didn't necessarily have the type right there, although for identifiers I guess it's a bit more debatable (resolve is always super tricky though).\n\nWe can always revisit these error messages once we've been using them for awhile to see if they were the best courses of action.\n",
