With hope, we can discuss this tomorrow. My opinion: it's really important to be able to distinguish, immediately, between \"I left out this case because I believe I can prove it's statically impossible to reach it\" and \"I forgot to include this case\". If we don't have that, it's going to get really embarrassing. Just look at some of the experience reports from the darcs people about how many of the errors involved use of `Maybe::fromJust` (the Haskell equivalent of `option::get`) without proving that it wouldn't fail with a non-exhaustive match.\n",
