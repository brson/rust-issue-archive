There are use-cases for both (the former can be used for something like cycling through a finite list of elements that gets shuffled and reused each time it's exhausted, the latter is because things being non-`mut` when they can be feels nicer), but having two seems a little silly.\n- the name & behaviour of `Range`, it really should be `Uniform` but then it should be implemented as `[lo, hi]` inclusive.\n- putting all this in `std`.\n\n(On that note, I'm planning to implement more distributions like Gamma, Poisson etc, would these go in std or extra?)\n",

(The back-to-`std` move sounds like something for after 1.0, since this stuff isn't super-important.)\n\n*Although `Range` really needs the `Sample`/`IndependentSample` traits to work nicely, but a method for sampling can just go as a normal non-trait method, and `Sample` etc implemented for it in `extra`.\n",
