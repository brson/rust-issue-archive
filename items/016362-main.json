  "body": "Pros:\nI like this example because it's concise without being trivial. The Monty Hall example code is somewhat lengthy and possibly inaccessible to those unfamiliar with probability.\n\nCons:\nThe Monty Hall example already exists. Do we need another example? Also, this is probably inaccessible to people who don't know basic geometry.\n",
