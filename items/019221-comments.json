    "body": "I have a `#[no_std]` introsort implementation at [veddan/rust-introsort](https://github.com/veddan/rust-introsort). It's faster than the standard sort for all inputs I can find, and is significantly faster if the input is partially sorted or has few unique values. One temporary issue is that, unlike the merge sort in `std`, the comparison function fails to inline with old-style closures. Therefore it uses unboxed closures and has a different signature than `std`'s `sort_by`.\n\nMaybe the non-allocating sort function in `core` can be re-exported in `std` as `unstable_sort` or something similar?\n",

    "body": "I started looking into this. GrailSort is a bit faster for some inputs (by the Wikisort author's own claim), but WikiSort is _considerably_ better documented (and public domain!). As such it seems like the more promising algorithm to duplicate.\n\nThat said, it's _complex_. An optimized Wikisort involves an implementation of insertion sort, vanilla merge sort, sorting networks (with side-tables for stability), and of course the actual wikisort algorithm. All in all the impl ends up being about 900 lines of well-documented C++ code. Not insane, but not a walk in the park, either.\n",
