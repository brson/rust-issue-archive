To be clear, the reason that `push_all` hasn't been stabilized in the past has _not_ been a desire to improve its implementation, but rather to specialize `extend` to use the `push_all` implementation. In other words, the point of dissatisfaction was having semantically identical APIs where the client is forced to explicitly call the more specialized one for the best performance.\n\nNow, that said, i think the performance guarantees you're raising are an important (though orthogonal) point. One uncomfortable thing about the [current `push_all` implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcollections/vec.rs#L929-L946) is that it's carefully tailored to trigger the right LLVM optimizations. Of course, it'd be much nicer if we could provide an actual guarantee about the generated code instead -- and not just for this function, but for a handful of others throughout `std`.\n\nOne way to address this desire might be to add more ad hoc intrinsics, but I wonder if there's any way we might eventually allow \"inline MIR\", so to speak, and whether that'd be enough to express the precise code you want to generate.\n\nOn the whole, I still think it's reasonable to stabilize something `push_all` as the best way we currently have of appending a slice onto a vector. I'm not particularly bothered by the intent to deprecate, both because it will be some time before we're in a position to do so, and because the whole point of the stabilization and deprecation process is to allow relatively smooth evolution without breakage (since deprecated items are not actually removed). We shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, especially when we have a good process for iterating toward perfection over time :)\n\n> It is also unfortunate that the name `push_all` is so different from `clone_from_slice`. It might be good to rename it `push_from_slice`, or a different name if `clone_from_slice` gets renamed.\n\n@alexcrichton didn't mention this, but no one was particularly a fan of the name. :+1: on renaming, and matching the `clone_from_slice` idiom probably makes sense.\n",
