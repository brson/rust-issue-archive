Having to manually save the object in a variable isn't great, but a syntax extension to do expand\n\n``` rust\nscope!(Success) { thing }\n```\n\nto something like\n\n``` rust\nlet __scope_<FILE>_<LINE>_<COL> = ::std::scope::scope(Success, { thing });\n```\n\nshouldn't be too hard. I don't think it can be done with a `macro_rules` currently.\n",

    "body": "The original blocker for this was that closures didn't borrow their contents, so an implementation was unsound. The source of this unsoundness has been fixed, and this was attempted in #11905. The PR was abandoned because the borrowing became too unmanageable (prevented too many legitimate situations).\n\nA new effort may uncover something different, and this may need to be a language feature rather than a library if we do indeed add it.\n",
