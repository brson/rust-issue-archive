    "body": "The way the parser currently works is that it just halts parsing on an `}` character. That way the parser recursively calls itself when parsing the interiors of methods. I thought it turned out to be pretty nice, but this was the one corner case that it encountered where it got a bit ugly.\n\nI haven't exactly written a lot of hand-written parsers, so this could probably be re-implemented in some other fashion. I was just happy that the only fields of the parser were the source string an an iterator.\n",
