  "body": "This pull request removes some non-POSIX bashisms found in the configure script (namely [`local` scope variables](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Bashism#Builtins)) and adds the `x86_64-sun-solaris` build triple so that configure can successfully run on Solaris based operating systems (like SmartOS).\n\nThe configure script also behaves as a shell wrapper for `/usr/bin/ksh` if it detects that `/bin/sh` (or any other non-POSIX shell) is being used on SunOS.  The problem is that the `/bin/sh` built into SunOS _is not_ POSIX compliant, rather than there being an POSIX compliance issue with the configure script itself.  Dash explicitly supports local scope variables as a non-POSIX extension, which may be why that specific bashism has remained unnoticed.  I wonder how many more times I can fit the word POSIX into this already POSIX filled paragraph?\n\nSee also #21000, #25845, #25846, and #25889.\n\nQuestion about next steps for building on SmartOS:\n\nI still have yet to successfully build rust on SmartOS, although these changes to the configure process have gotten me a little further down the building road.  What would be the next steps for getting a stage0 snapshot built for SmartOS?  That's about as far down the compilation process as I've been able to go.\n",
