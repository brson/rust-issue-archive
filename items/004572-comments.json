    "body": "Performance issues aside, I have a feeling the \"This is awful\" comment may relate to the way the original implementation was using a boolean flag as a sort of half-arsed \"break\" (this must have been written before the \"new\" for loop syntax). This forces each_path to parse & iterate over every item in an imported crate during decoding even when the predicate returns false. I don't think that's necessary, but my gut says it's unlikely the typical case will be made any faster by cleaning that up.\n\nI'm cleaning up each_path a little while I dig into another, unrelated metadata issue but I'm curious: if we were to nuke this, what would we replace it with? \n",
