    "body": "We'd need some new place where we put:\n- Linkage metadata (which should only be defined in one place)\n- References to the tree of files you want to compile together into a crate (or inter-file references, like \"this mod is defined in this other file\")\n- Linkage-level exports and versioning (we haven't done multiple version exports yet, but may well)\n- \"Phased\" compilation (loading syntax extensions, checking language version compatibility before / during parsing)\n\nIf we can work through all those then I agree there might be a way to do this. But crate files do different things than source files at the moment (and have more planned), so we need workalikes for all those \"different things\" in source files. I do not want to lose the general flavour of the compilation model (one input file, self-describing builds, etc.) though I can see a benefit to this: it'd make splitting and combining crates much less of a chore.\n",

Particularly if we decide on a thought-out approach to #2159 in the sense of a smallest-unit-of-text at the top of a file that we can parse and interpret, to look for an indication of which version of the language to compile with. Either version guarding or feature guarding or something. That's the crucial bit in terms of phased compilation, I think.\n",
