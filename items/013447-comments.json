    "body": "Feature detection at build time wouldn't be ideal for us. We build our rust code and ship shared objects. If the feature detection was at build time, we would need to ship builds for both kernels and figure out which so to load at runtime.\n\n@DaGenix this is an incorrect assertion. Rust can be used to build shared objects that are distributed in binary form to customers. Also, while 2.6.18 is an \"old kernel\" red hat enterprise linux has shipped a version of their OS w/ kernel 2.6.18 as recently as October 2013. Also, there is still at least one fairly large cloud hosting provider providing VMs w/ linux kernel 2.6.18.\n",
