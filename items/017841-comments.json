    "body": "@eddyb I'd be interested in seeing what you have for the structural stuff. This is all (relatively) fresh in my mind, so I can tell what almost every change is doing (and whether or not we have a good reason to keep it at all) just by looking. Rather than first splitting the history into separate commits, and then doing a rebase onto #23265 as a separate step, I am tempted to rewrite the history into 2 themed commits and rebase onto #23265 at the same time (basically by hand). If you already have a structural commit more-or-less done, this would be simpler.\n\nI think that I can get this done in a few hours here and there over the next couple of days. If I can get the rebase out of the way, we can split the remaining work just by looking at test cases. I have a significant list of things that I would expect to work, but haven't tried yet, and another list of things that need to produce appropriate error messages rather than ICEs. We can probably do some of those things in follow-up after the initial PR, but a few changes really should be addressed up front (like importing constants from another crate).\n",
