  "body": "Port of pcwalton removal of `#[unsafe_destructor]` check.\n\nEarlier commits impose rules on lifetimes that make generic destructors safe; thus we no longer need the `#[unsafe_destructor]` attribute nor its associated check.\n\n---\n\nSo remove the check for the unsafe_destructor attribute.\n\nAnd remove outdated compile-fail tests from when lifetime-parameteric dtors were disallowed/unsafe.\n\nIn addition, when one uses the attribute without the associated feature, report that the attribute is deprecated.\n\nHowever, I do not think this is a breaking-change, because the attribute and feature are still currently accepted by the compiler. (After the next snapshot that has this commit, we can remove the feature itself and the attribute as well.)\n\n---\n\nI consider this to:\n\nFix #22196\n\n(technically there is still the post snapshot work of removing the last remnants of the feature and the attribute, but the ticket can still be closed in my opinion).\n",
