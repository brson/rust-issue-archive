There are a few questions about whether we should allow only a direct super-struct, or any transitive super-struct. We might also want to allow multiple expressions, which would be complicated. We might want a more general mechanism which allows a `.. expr` to provide only some of the fields, and then the super-struct cases would 'come out in the wash'.\n",

(which should be part of the common base ? .. you evolve that decision over time as your source grows..) .. you have less to go back and rewrite.\n",

I did move some of the field checking and collation into the collect phase and I build side tables for the super-struct of a struct and the declared fields of a struct. (I couldn't create a table for all fields here because some of the super-structs may not yet have been encountered, of course we could do another pass, but more on that later).\n\nSo after collect, we never scrape the AST, but we don't have a simple mapping from a struct to all its fields. I add a few methods to ty for getting all the fields for a struct (in ast and ty flavours, annoyingly), so this is only done in one place, eliminating the errors you worried about. If you like, we could cache these lists of all fields here. I believe that is easier than doing this pre-emptively either as a new pass or part of an existing one. I haven't done it because I'm not convinced it is a worthwhile optimisation for now, but I don't have a philosophical objection if you think otherwise.\n",
