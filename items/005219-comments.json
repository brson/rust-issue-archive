    "body": "Thanks for those links. We do generate rpaths with the expectation that some of them will be invalidated by moving the binaries around.\n\nIt's possible we could consider removing rpath, but it sure is nice to not think about dynamic loading when running binaries out of my build directory.\n\nWe could easily add a `--disable-rpath` flag to the configure script, to turn off the rpath for all the rust-provided libraries, with the assumption that package managers would modify `ld.so.conf.d` during install. If we did that I feel like we would still want the installed rustc to generate rpaths with user-built libraries - otherwise the experience would be different depending on the rust installation.\n\nWe could also just remove rpath completely - it doesn't work on windows anyway.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that, if we just used rustpkg for _all_ builds, and let rustpkg install all libraries at a known location, then we might be able to conveniently not use rpath while still doing the right thing at load time. Can user directories like `~/.rustpkg` be put into `ld.so.conf.d`?\n",

Does the current behavior prevent packaging in Fedora, and is there a minimal change we can make to unblock packaging?\n\n@graydon You'll probably be interested in this subject.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the rustpkg explanation.\nDo I understand that rustpkg will create binaries and libs with rpaths pointing to the user's specific rustpkg dir `~/.rustpkg`?\nMy feeling is that this user specific rpaths should be configurable at build time. The use case is obviously when the binary or lib is going to be installed systemwide. The only rpath exception is the rpath pointing to the system wide package specific libdir (e.g. `/usr/lib64/rust`).\n\nI think that I'll spend a bit more time with looking at `link.rs` and `rpath.rs` and might get a better feeling for the problem.\n\nBtw.: I noted that the libdir isn't configurabel. Fedora for example keeps x86_64 libs in (/usr)?/lib64, and i686 in (/usr)/lib. IIUIC this is currently not possible with rust as the libs will be installed to /usr/lib/arch-specific-path\n",

That makes it much easier to cope with - and that would also be in par with (at least) the Fedora guidelines. And I suppose with Debian's too, as it's the common way. (See 3rd party java binaries. They modify the `.bashrc` to point to some hidden dir in the userdir.)\n",

IIUIC - I always feel like a noob when it comes to autotools - autotools are generating wrappers for binaries which are created during a build process and moves the original binaries to hiddend irectories. The wrappers are then modifying the environment (setting env vars etc) to achieve the same goal (so e.g. that rustc can be run from the dev directory without messing with the env vars yourself).\n\nI wonder if this could help.\n",

Here's my current suggestion:\n- Modify the build system to once again set LD_LIBRARY_PATH/PATH to find the appropriate dynamic libraries.\n- Add a flag to rustc to disable rpath\n- Add a configure flag to disable rpathing the rust build itself. Packagers can use this to do whatever they want.\n\nWith this logic the rust package itself could avoid rpath where distros have their own way of dealing with library paths. The rustc installed by these distros would still be rpathing user's crates for the sake of convenience. Is this an acceptable compromise or do distros want us to _completely_ disable rpath? I'm afraid that doing so would provide an inconsistent developer experience depending on how rustc is acquired; if we need to do that then we instead must find a way to completely eliminate rpath.\n",
