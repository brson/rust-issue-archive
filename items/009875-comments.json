    "body": "@brson If I (or others here) can help further in getting this issue closed, I'd be glad to.\nDo you have some precise design changes you'd want to make?\n\nI have looked at your examples:\n- Sinatra has too few content for Rust, I think we don't want that so not sure what we could take as inspiration there really. It has a clean design and I think that the Rust website is clean too.\n- node.js, I think it looks good but at the cost of showing less information.\n- Homebrew shows a sort of quick Get Started instructions, good to get started quickly but newcomers would probably rather want to have a short but explicative presentation of the language.\n\nLooking at these as a whole, they all have a GitHub fork me banner (I have [a PR](https://github.com/graydon/rust-www/pulls/15) for that BTW), they too have some quirks on small screen widths.\nAnyways, if you have some precise design ideas please clarify them so that me or someone else here can sketch something new or discuss... because tbh I don't really see how we could use your examples (I do surely agree that they look good through!).\n",

This ties into #9876 and #9877.\n- A prominent link to the tutorial, which must be amazing (#9874).\n- The minimum amount of additional links.\n- Ample whitespace.\n\nHere are some additional elements that may be important or desirable.\n- A tagline along the lines of the existing 'a safe, concurrent, practical language'.\n- An example like that on the nodejs page that shows you how to write something simple and invoke the compiler to run it.\n",
