  "body": "(This is only a94c86e, the other two are from #6073.)\n\nVery basic support for sampling from N(0,1) and Exp(1). This is basically my experimentations with the Ziggurat algorithm, and will certainly get reorganised when [Lib-rand](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Lib-rand) gets finished.\n\nNo tests or anything, other than generating 1 million numbers from each distribution, loading it into R and plotting and performing some basic tests (which passed) i.e. Pearson's chi-squared for the Exp(1) values, and Shapiro-Wilks for the N(0,1) values.\n\n![normal-exp](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1203825/435879/097fbf4e-b011-11e2-90fe-6cf9a7f80dce.png)\n\n(These will be tested better when the lib rand changes linked above start to happen.)\n\n(Also, it's not hugely relevant, but I noticed that this is about double the speed of R for summing 10000000 samples from the normal distribution, even though the current random-float code is subobtimal.)\n\nNo need to merge this if it seems like it's being too hasty.\n",
