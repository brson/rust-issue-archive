  "body": "Macro desugaring of `in PLACE { BLOCK }` into \"simpler\" expressions following the in-development \"Placer\" protocol.\n\nIncludes Placer API that one can override to integrate support for `in` into one's own type.  (See [RFC 809](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0809-box-and-in-for-stdlib.md).)\n\nPart of #22181\n\nReplaced PR #26180.\n\nTurns on the `in PLACE { BLOCK }` syntax, while leaving in support for the old `box (PLACE) EXPR` syntax (since we need to support that at least until we have a snapshot with support for `in PLACE { BLOCK }`.\n\n(Note that we are not 100% committed to the `in PLACE { BLOCK }` syntax.  In particular I still want to play around with some other alternatives.  Still, I want to get the fundamental framework for the protocol landed so we can play with implementing it for non `Box` types.)\n\n---\n\nAlso, this PR leaves out support for desugaring-based `box EXPR`.  We will hopefully land that in the future, but for the short term there are type-inference issues injected by that change that we want to resolve separately.\n",
