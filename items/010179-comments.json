    "body": "Hm, I actually quite like the name `fs` instead of `file` for this module. It's short, concise, and allows us to easily move file/directory operations under it.\n\nAdditionally, I'm not sure that we need to keep the static methods any more. If we called the module `fs`, I would rather have things like `fs::copy`, `File::open`, `fs::rmdir_recursive`, etc. I think that the constructors of a `File` should be static methods, but nothing else really needs to be.\n",
