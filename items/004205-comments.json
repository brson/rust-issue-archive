    "body": "@sanxiyn I can't explain why I closed that one, nor am I sure of the state of old-style operator overloading. Last I knew it still worked but recent changes may have removed it in passing.\n\nOld overloading worked by the name of the method alone, so `add` was `+`. The telltale sign of old operator overloading is when an impl of `Num` is enough to overload the arithmetic operators (by virtue of its `add`, etc. methods). `+` is _supposed_ to be implemented with the `Add` trait, not `Num`.\n",
