I think we can use an equality constraint on the associated type `<T=uint>` to make this work for the size hint (i.e., you only get an Iterator implementation when it is safe to give a size hint, with better trait matching in the future, we could do better and always get an Iterator impl, but only give a size hint if it is safe).\n",
