    "body": "@thestinger Marker types do not seem _clearer_ to me than `Cell`, quite the opposite, but of course thi is a matter of opinion.\n\nAt first I thought you were on to something regarding `Freeze`, but then I realize that I was mistaken. In particular, we need to settle on precisely what makes something not `Freeze`: must the interior mutability be something _interior_, something that you _own_, or just something you can _reach_?\n\nBut this question is orthogonal to whether we use markers or `Cell`. If I understand it, the use of `Cell` would look something like this:\n\n```\nstruct RcBox<T> {\n    value: T,\n    strong: Cell<uint>,\n    weak: Cell<uint>\n}\n\npub struct Rc<T> {\n    priv ptr: *mut RcBox<T>,\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, whether or not `Rc` is `Freeze` will hinge directly on what we decide about owning vs mutability. At present, the definition is based on reachability. But this definition may be stronger than what we need. I guess it depends on just what `Freeze` is to be used for.\n\nSo after considering this some more, I still think that using `Cell` is the right call for `Rc` is the right call, but the real discussion is what `Freeze` precisely ought to mean, which is most properly discussed I think under #11781.\n\n@thestinger make sense?\n",
