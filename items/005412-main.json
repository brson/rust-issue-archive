  "body": "```\nlibrustc: Make the compiler ignore purity. \u2026\n```\n\nFor bootstrapping purposes, this commit does not remove all uses of\nthe keyword \"pure\" -- doing so would cause the compiler to no longer\nbootstrap due to some syntax extensions (\"deriving\" in particular).\nInstead, it makes the compiler ignore \"pure\". Post-snapshot, we can\nremove \"pure\" from the language.\n\nThere are quite a few (~100) borrow check errors that were essentially\nall the result of mutable fields or partial borrows of `@mut`. Per\ndiscussions with Niko I think we want to allow partial borrows of\n`@mut` but detect obvious footguns. We should also improve the error\nmessage when `@mut` is erroneously reborrowed.\n\nr? @nikomatsakis \n",
