That way the user has something relatively googleable and, as a benefit, if they go to the [HashMap docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html), the first thing they see is `pub struct HashMap<K, V, S = RandomState> { /* fields omitted */ }` which immediately hints at\u00a0what `V` is. An alternative message could be \"Could not infer type for generic `V` in `HashMap<i32, V, ..>` (though I like this less since it distracts from the issue.\r\n\r\nI'm somewhat on the fence with using `_` since there's both positives and negative to it. It's almost what we want, but it has the unfortunate connotation of \"infer this,\" and we do know what the `_` is in this case. That's sort of why I prefer the first suggestion I had but also don't like it since it requires more knowledge, to an extent.",
