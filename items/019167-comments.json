The conflict can be resolved by converting the `AsSlice`'s `T` parameter into an output associated type, but AI is still too buggy to do that at the moment.\n\nThat blanket `impl` also has the downside that it allows some odd comparisons like `&[1] == Ok(1)` and `vec![0] != None`, since `Option` and `Result` also implement `AsSlice`. \n\nI guess I'll manually implement `PartialEq` between the types that make sense.\n",

    "body": "I've pushed the updated branch, I've added `impl`s that allow using the `==` on these different types:\n- `String` == `&str`\n- `Vec` == `&[_]` == `&mut [_]` == `[_, ..N]` (and `== Box<[_]>` in the future)\n- `InternedString` == `&str`\n\nIn the case of slices/vectors you can use `==` on slices that contain different types but implement `PartialEq`, for example you can compare `Vec<String> ==[&'static str, ..2]` (and in the future `== &[CowString]`)\n\nThere is some fallout that I'm still fixing, these are common issues that I have encounter:\n- `slice == &[a, b]`, the `&[a, b]` literal gets treated as `&[T, ..N]`, and since `&[T] == &[T, ..N]` is not covered by the `impl`s, it fails to compile. This worked before this PR because both sides were forced to have the same type, and the `&[a, b]` got coerced to `&[T]`. The solution is to change the expression to `slice == [a, b]`, which work fine for arrays with less than 32 elements.\n- `vec == iter.collect()` needs type annotation on the collect method. Since the sides of the comparison may have different types, the compiler can't force the collect output to be `Vec<_>`.\n- (And the worst) `lhs == mem::transmute(rhs)`. Again the compiler can't force the output of the `transmute` to match the type of `lhs`, so type annotations are required. This pattern is heavily used in the tests of `std::os::path` to convert between `&str` and `&[u8]`, and I'm still thinking on how to fix the fallout in the less painful way possible.\n\nThese `PartialEq` `impl`s make a **lot** of `as_slice` method calls unnecessary, but I haven't attempted to remove them yet.\n\nThoughts up to this point? Do we want all these `PartialEq` `impl`s? Is the fallout in type inference acceptable?\n\nOne more thing, `impl PartialEq<Rhs> for Lhs` needs the `default_type_params` feature gate, whereas `impl PartialEq for Foo` and `#[deriving(PartialEq)]` do not.\n",

Some thoughts about the points you raised:\n\n> `vec == iter.collect()`\n\nThis seems ok, I'm not sure it's all that common of a pattern. In general this is a worry of making operations more generic than they used to be which is to require more type annotations because inference has less to go on.\n\n> `slice == &[a, b]`\n\nThis is a little worrying, as I would definitely be expecting this to work. cc @aturon, this is one of the unfortunate spots where coercions seem like they should work but end up not working out.\n\n> `lhs == mem::transmute(rhs)`\n\nThis should not be a common pattern at all. A function like this should definitely be in a helper function to make the `transmute` a little safer. Which is to say, I'm not super duper worried about this.\n",

    "body": "This looks good to me, though I left some comments about a few concerns.\n\nI'm not particularly worried about the extra type annotations or shifting with arrays, since almost all cases of these were in tests. Also, @alexcrichton, there's been a bit of churn about exactly what coercions may apply to arrays vs slices; I think what this PR is doing there is pretty reasonable.\n\nI especially liked the point about `iter::order`, which demonstrates a trait design tradeoff I hadn't fully considered before, and gives a stronger reason to make iterators use associated types (granted we were planning to anyway). Kudos for figuring this out!\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think about the comments I left, and nice work as usual :)\n",

If you do `impl Deref<str> for MyString`, now you can do `[Cow]String == MyString` even though `MyString` doesn't implement `PartialEq`.\n\nIt's a tradeoff:\n- With the blanket `Deref` impl, you only need 2 more `impl` and then you can do the 16 combinations of comparisons between `&str`, `String`, `CowString` and `MyString`:\n  - `impl PartialEq<Rhs> for MyString where Rhs: Deref<str>`\n  - `impl PartialEq<MyString> for &str`\n- Without the blanket `Deref` impl, you'll have to add 7 more impls to accomplish the same thing, but you don't get the surprising `[Cow]String == MyString` when you add `impl Deref<str> for MyString`.\n",

    "body": "@japaric OK, I think we're on the same page now.\n\nAs far as the tradeoff goes, my thoughts are:\n1. I believe we should have a strong convention that any impl of `PartialEq` should be accompanied by a symmetric impl.\n2. In general, if there's a tradeoff between APIs and implementation work, I will always favor doing more implementation work to support better APIs.\n\nI just talked to @alexcrichton and he agrees with the above.\n\nCan you change this PR to guarantee symmetry in all cases? For dealing with the combinatorial explosion, you could consider using macros.\n",
