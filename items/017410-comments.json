    "body": "The main change here is that rustc will now warn about variants that are never constructed. I concluded this would be a worthwhile lint after finding that https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5d335c94bd9017f16ce7538a5f4063e1178f15a1/src/librustc/middle/mem_categorization.rs#L91 is never constructed, yet there is plenty of code throughout rustc that deals with it. Which _could_ be a bug but I haven't investigated yet.\n\nFunnily enough, with this change rustc still doesn't warn about that particular case due to the Clone trait being derived on the `categorization` enum. I think it's worth investigating potential ways of allowing the dead lint to be useful even in the presence of traits like `Clone` being derived but it's not included in this PR.\n\nIn addition, I changed the messages to be more descriptive with regards to the particular nodes that are proven unused.\n\nLast, but not least, I also investigated how much dead code there is in rustc after disabling re-exports. Turns out, quite a lot. I carefully removed what I thought was truly dead code but I still question if it's something we should do.\n",
