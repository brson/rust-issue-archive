    "body": "Thanks for the PR! Right now, however, the [design of the `raw` modules](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1044-io-fs-2.1.md#stdosplatformraw) is to explicitly not be exhaustive and only provide what the standard library itself exposes. These aren't currently exposed, so I'm going to close this.\n\nI'd recommend taking a look at @retep998's excellent set of [winapi crates](https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs) for bindings like this though!\n",
