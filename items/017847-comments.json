    "body": "This is actually working as-expected today, [the amendment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/200) to the RFC states that an item is public if it's marked `pub`, end of story. That means that the `Parent` trait is indeed \"public\" in that sense, and this code should be accepted.\n\nCan you clarify which part of RFC 48 you think forbids this? The amendment may not have updated all the examples! The section you highlighted, however, doesn't seem to forbid this code.\n",
