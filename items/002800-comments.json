    "body": "I think Unicode code points are much more intuitive to work with, not having to deal with implementation details of some specific encoding.\nIf a string consists of UTF-8 code units, then a single character may consist of one to four code units.\nSo I can have a ten-character string with a length of 40.\nOperations like getting a substring can leave you with broken characters, by extracting fewer than all of the code units of a character.\nAs for other languages, Python used to do different things depending on how it was compiled.\nThis is [fixed as of Python 3.3](http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.3.html), and it now supports the full Unicode range without having to deal with surrogate pairs, and string operations are much more intuitive for it.\nCan\u2019t think of many examples off-hand, but one other language that defines characters in terms of code points, rather than code units in some specific encoding, is Haskell, at least since [Haskell 98](http://www.haskell.org/definition/haskell98-report.pdf).\n",

    "body": "Our strings definitely _are_ utf8, it's not just \"some specific encoding\". We're very much exposing that and expecting programmers to know what that means. As they know what 2s complement integers (not auto-expanding-to-bignums) and 754 floating point (not rationals) are and what they do. If you want an array of unicode codepoints, that's `[char]`, not `str`. Likewise if you want a utf16 array, that's a different thing too. Python is actually the wrong precedent here; we're a systems language and users _frequently_ flip into \"I know about the in-memory implementation\" assumptions, even rely on them.\n\nThat said, I'm _somewhat_ sympathetic to the arguments about which way to do this. Followup is on the list, over in the thread that created this bug: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2012-July/002024.html\n\nYes, this is part of the \"utf8 monoculture\" some people despise, but I am somewhat unrepentant about it. I think it's as stable, flexible and long-term an encoding as we're likely to see for years; the only plausible competitor on the horizon is GB18030 and it even covers different codepoints, so it's not really fair to consider it a \"different encoding\", it's a whole different charset. And, in any case, my experience is that the harm done to language users, especially systems-language users, by being _ambiguous_ about the in-memory meaning of literals in program text far outweighs the harm done by picking some particular unambiguous interpretation. IOW on this topic I think the risk of underspecification is higher than the risk of overspecification. It would be more useful to support multiple-explicit-encodings -- even permit tagging a whole file as written-to-a-different-default-encoding -- if that every becomes a real concern, than to throw our hands up about the encoding and say \"strings are implementation-specific!\"\n\nIncidentally, it should be trivial to write a syntax extension that maps from encoding-to-encoding at compile time, i.e. one that lets you write `utf16! \"hello \\U0010f0B1\"` and have it expand at compile time to `[0xfeff_u16, 0x0068_u16, 0x0065_u16, 0x006c_u16, 0x006c_u16, 0x006f_u16, 0xd8c3_u16, 0xdcb1_u16]`, or similar. Just note that this has a _different type_ from `str`.\n",
