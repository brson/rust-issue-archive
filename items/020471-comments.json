    "body": "I think the destructuring let feels quite natural for tuples:\n\n```\nlet (x, y) = (1i, 2i);\n```\n\nIt's when its used on a struct that it feels weird at first:\n\n```\nlet MyStruct(new_int_binding) = instance_of_MyStruct\n```\n\nHaving spent most of my time in Ruby/Python/Java/C, when I see `Type(var)` it immediately looks to me like `var` is an existing variable being passed as a parameter to create a new instance of `Type`, rather than the name of a new variable pulling something out of an instance of `Type`.\n\nI think the comparison to tuple destructuring really helps a lot though. It makes it clearer that what you're doing is writing a binding declaration on the left that kind of 'lines up with' the value on the right. Would something like this be an OK addition?\n\n> As you can see here, you can extract the inner integer type through a destructuring let. This is equivalent to how you would extract values from a tuple, with the bindings on the left wrapped in a type matching that of the value on the right: `let (x, y) = (1i, 2i);`.\n\nIf the inline code example isn't OK, you could probably even just drop it and still gain a lot from the comparison, in my opinion.\n",
