  "body": "Depends on #28631.\nFixes the memory fault in #28129 (and makes the problem cause explicit: stdout is being initialised during the thread destruction).\n\nBefore this is merged I would like to investigate how the mac-specific hack in `destroy_value` is related to this (in particular if it is still needed).\n\nSome guidance about what is the best way to use TLS variables in a robust way (in particular in drop implementations) would be very appreciated.\nFrom the reference manual I infer that `state` should always be checked if the function can be called from a site in which the TLS destructor has already run.\nAt least in library code this might become very common, so I guess we might either have an idiomatic way to do it (and provide an example in the docs) or even have a `safe_with` method which provides an `Option`, so that the not-available (already destroyed/being destroyed) case always needs to be explicitly handled.\n",
