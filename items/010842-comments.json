I am not the one to ask about how to compile rust, but rust sources hardcode linking to libc++, so if you are trying to build against libstdc++, that will likely need some tweaks. Though probably staying with libc++ on x86 is easier. Emutls in mrustc-rust port is coming from compiler-rt, so should be perfectly compatible with libc++.",
