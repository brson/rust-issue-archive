  "body": "Now that LLVM has been updated, the only remaining roadblock to implementing\nunwinding for MSVC is to fill out the runtime support in `std::rt::unwind::seh`.\nThis commit does precisely that, fixing up some other bits and pieces along the\nway:\n- The `seh` unwinding module now uses `RaiseException` to initiate a panic.\n- The `rust_try.ll` file was rewritten for MSVC (as it's quite different) and is\n  located at `rust_try_msvc_64.ll`, only included on MSVC builds for now.\n- The personality function for all landing pads generated by LLVM is hard-wired\n  to `__C_specific_handler` instead of the standard `rust_eh_personality` lang\n  item. This is required to get LLVM to emit SEH unwinding information instead\n  of DWARF unwinding information. This also means that on MSVC the\n  `rust_eh_personality` function is entirely unused (but is defined as it's a\n  lang item).\n\nMore details about how panicking works on SEH can be found in the\n`rust_try_msvc_64.ll` or `seh.rs` files, but I'm always open to adding more\ncomments!\n\nA key aspect of this PR is missing, however, which is that **unwinding is still\nturned off by default for MSVC**. There is a [bug in llvm](https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23884) which\ncauses optimizations to inline enough landing pads that LLVM chokes. If the\ncompiler is optimized at `-O1` (where inlining isn't enabled) then it can\nbootstrap with unwinding enabled, but when optimized at `-O2` (inlining is\nenabled) then it hits a fatal LLVM error.\n",
