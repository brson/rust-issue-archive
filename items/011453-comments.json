The fact that they could share tails is mostly an implementation detail (and if this list were restricted to only containing `Freeze` types, then it would be entirely an implementation detail).\n\nAn _owned_ singly-linked list like this is isomorphic to a stack implemented using a vector, and the vector form is far more efficient: \n- contiguous in memory; nicer for caches\n- O(1) length & indexing\n- very fast iteration\n\nConverting this code to use `Rc<>` rather than `~` would be better from my perspective. (Although the moving and mutable iterators would have to be removed too.)\n",
