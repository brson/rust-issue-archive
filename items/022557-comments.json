    "body": "This is actually the expected behavior, I believe, though writing this comment is making me want to dig a bit deeper to make sure.\n\nWhat is happening is that when an explicit annotation is provided, `|x: &mut Nothing|` yields a type that is qualified over all `'a`, I believe, and it then ignores the expected type. This winds up (I think) being a subtype of what is actually required in the various cases and hence things type check, except when they don't. Sorry this is not detailed, as I said, I want to dig in to confirm and maybe then provide a more detailed trace of what is going on.\n\nThat said, if my hypothesis is correct, then there are two routes to fix this:\n1. Either we combine the expected type and the manual annotation.\n2. We augment the manual annotation so that we can more precisely specify what is needed here.\n\nSimilarly the example from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22557#issuecomment-75184234 is I think harmless -- basically the caller is providing a fn where 'a and 'b will be bound the same lifetime, and that's ok, but the callee doesn't get to assume that it does.\n",

The reason the results are a bit surprising is that the code is a bit hokey right now but not (I believe) unsound (though it wouldn't surprise me if there was a gotcha in some particular case). One thing it does do is separate out the expected argument and return types. So in these cases part of what results for the inconsistent errors is that we infer the return type based on the expectation. For `bar`, that is `&mut Nothing` with the same lifetime as the input -- and that case type checks. But for `foo`, that is a fresh variable to represent `T`. In that case, we wind up relating this variable to a pointer whose lifetime is a free region specific to `foo`. This yields a compilation error because `T` must outlive the call to `foo`, and it can't if the region is confined to `foo`. This is a \"known hokey\" part of the impl because I feel that this kind of error should be enforced in a different way, but we still get some kind of error when an error is expected.\n\nAn example of code that probably ought to compile but doesn't because of this phenomena is:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let f = |x: &i32| x;\n    let i = &3;\n    let j = f(i);\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, there is no expected return type, so you wind up with a fresh variable, just as in `foo`. To make this compile you have to add an explicit return type annotation.\n",
