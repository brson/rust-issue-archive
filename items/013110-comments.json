    "body": "On second though (sorry I didn't think of this sooner), I agree with @FlaPer87. I think this belongs in `build_output_filenames` rather than in `rustc/lib.rs`. The doesn't currently handle the case where `-o` or `--out-dir` wasn't specified, but the output is a directory. Additionally, it also doesn't handle the case where you have `--emit=foo,bar,baz` and one of the output formats is a directory.\n\nI think that all temporary/destination files are threaded through the `OutputFilenames` structure, so I believe that instrumenting that structure would work. You will have to instrument both the `path` and `temp_path` methods to check if the destination is a directory or whether some parent directory doesn't exist.\n\nI'm personally inclined to just fix the ICE rather than add extra instrumentation all over the place for one small class of errors with this information in mind. As long as something is printed at some point about a missing directory or file mismatch, I don't think it's too bad.\n",

I'll keep working on the issue. \n\nIf anyone has any tips on how to get lldb to work with rustc when compiled with debug information, I'd appreciate the help. I've had no luck setting line level break points with either lldb or gdb on OS X where the bug is present. But, I'll keep trying to get something working. Thanks!\n",

    "body": "@FlaPer87 - I apologize, my comment wasn't very clear. While the patch I submitted stops the behavior from occurring, it doesn't solve the ICE. My goal after @alexcrichton 's last comment was to solve the actual ICE. \n\nLLVM correctly returns an error when either the out-dir or the out-file cannot be written. On Ubuntu, where I cannot reproduce the error (I ran my test 1000 times), the error message is correct and the ICE doesn't present itself. On OS X the ICE shows up the majority of the time. When it doesn't, LLVM's generated error is returned but mangled. \n\nThis is the reason I am trying to get debug information. I'd like to set {break, watch}points around librustc/back/link/LLVMRustWriteOutputFile.rs:78 to see if the error is being corrupted, but I've not been able to do so on OS X.\n",
