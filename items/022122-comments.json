However, by not providing a simple method to identify the environment variable in error, I suspect many application administrators will be subjected errors missing this critical piece of information (because deadlines force compromises).\n\nI was really hoping this would make it into v1.0 because adding the name is likely to be a breaking change for consumers of VarError.\n\nAnyway, if it does not make v1.0, consumers will need to capture the environment variable name if it is needed.  Here is my solution: https://gist.github.com/galsondor/d1aadf821300f982ac1f\n\nBTW, the \"NotUnicode\" enum variant captures the error data, which is also not required by all consumers and probably even less useful than the name.\n",
