    "body": "Personally I also think this issue is somewhat misguided and can be mitigated by other means. I agree that something more robust than DJB hash should be used, but - and not to try and say this isn't an actual issue - is it not feasible to simply use a different data structure for such associative container, like a rebalancing binary search tree? This is the underlying implementation of `Data.Map` in Haskell and it works well. C++'s default associative container `map` is also a search tree underneath (and `unordered_map` is the hash-table version.)\n\nThe reason I say this is because they have better worst-case properties than a hash table which will degrade to O(n) with specially crafted input. Using a better hash function won't necessarily fix this worst case property (and let's not forget that randomness as a seed in a hash depends on a secure PRNG, which is a topic in and of itself.)\n\nYes, this is a real issue, and it's even affected the [linux kernel](http://www.iss.net/security_center/reference/vuln/linux-kernel-packets-dos.htm). Sometimes the worst-case is actually very important as opposed to the average-case. I think it is strange that so many people default to hash tables for such containers. At best, this seems like an issue of people just using whatever the default their language provides them with - or what is familiar - as opposed to what makes sense (many scripting languages use hash tables as the default associative-data-structure as an implementation detail. It seems like \"the most natural choice,\" but I'd argue that's a position of familiarity, not necessarily the reality.)\n\nBST's are well understood, simple, and have predictable performance properties, as opposed to hash tables which have complicated performance properties due to both the hash and underlying implementation (and a much worse worst-case.) If you optimize and find out that dealing with the fields in POST data is a bottleneck of horrific proportions, then optimize with a hash table, and a random seed, whatever. Otherwise, use simple things that work and you'll avoid the problem.\n\nAgain I think everybody would accept a patch here and I'm not trying to say this _is not_ an issue, but I feel that maybe these issues can be attacked in other, simpler ways with more predictable performance, as opposed to just adding randomness and a better hash, and hoping it goes away.\n",

    "body": "So there's a lot of different points made here, let me re-cap\n1. marijnh: \"For most situations, a simpler, faster function is preferable\":\n\nFixing this is a matter of a) random seed generated once at each program startup, b) Using ^ instead of +, c) maybe change the 33 to a larger prime (still as easy to compute, e.g. 65537). This should not be slower nor too much complexity.\n1. marijnh: \"the same problem exists in every single hash function used in the Rust codebase, not just the one on strings.\"\n\nTrue. But a) ideally, all hash functions should be fixed and b) strings are the most popular dictionary key type, especially when you write a web service that accepts JSON or similar input.\n1. thoughtpolice/killerswan: maps are better than hashtables\n\nFor huge sizes, the log n average case difference can matter, that can be a valid reason to use a hash table. This is why hash tables should not be vulnerable to collision attacks. Independent of that point, it might be sensible to use maps as default container.\n1. killerswan: We should use murmur or CityHash or similar\n\nMight be a good idea and would hopefully fix this bug (haven't looked at the actual code of those hash functions).\n",
