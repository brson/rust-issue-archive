    "body": "I agree. I think that this mod should be applied at least to [`read_line()`](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/io/buffered/struct.BufferedReader.html#method.read_line) which just reads a single line (iterators can be a different story eventually &mdash; maybe we want to keep it for the line iterator so that the total of its content is exactly equal to the originating input? I don't know).\n\nCurrent behavior forces to trim EOL chars when [for example](https://github.com/adridu59/rust-tuts/blob/181f29a7b4c26e43c82439f4aa29ff66bf6c6cb2/code/05.rs#L109) casting stdin input to a numbered type.\n\nWe probably need a [`read_until()`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/464d1d044eebace50d17c10731493d6898490876/src/libstd/io/mod.rs#L1163) function (that's what `read_line()` is made of, and `.lines()` is itself made of the former) variant that pushes everything but the byte character you want to stop at.\nHope that this proposal makes sense.\n\ncc @alexcrichton\n",

    "body": "Since @alexcrichton seemed interested in what other languages do; in the Python world this would typically be handled by reading the entire file into a string and calling [splitlines](http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines). Which takes advantage of an underlying Python TextIO feature of \"universal newlines\" in which the File IO layer hides the different types of newlines from the user; all instances of '\\n', '\\r' and '\\r\\n' are returned as '\\n'. This was introduced in [PEP3116](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3116/#text-i-o).\n\nThis would be similar to using Rust's [AnyLineIterator](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/str/typedef.AnyLineIterator.html). \n\nOf course reading the whole file in as a string isn't always a great idea. Generally I'd guess (as with @WebeWizard here) you'd be dealing with CSV's. In Python's case this is handled by a [separate library](http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html). I did see one rust CSV library which looked to be [struggling slightly with newlines](https://github.com/grahame/rust-csv/blob/master/csv.rs#L223) itself.\n\nI wonder if Rust needs higher level File IO libraries (such as csv) or if extending the BufferedReader as suggested here is a good idea for the meantime? It's also worth considering if introducing something like \"universal newlines\" could be easier now than later.\n",
