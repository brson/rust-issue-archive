    "body": "In 079c3b02a86aa73d0d070876612ed889dc187354 I changed the CPU string to \"generic\" which triggers the most-conservative subtarget mode on LLVM (rather than sniffing the host). This was necessary to get our builds.\n\nThis should help a bit on the subtarget-related bugs linked above (at least after the next snapshot) but it doesn't really fix the ability-to-specify-subtarget problem. Just makes it hurt less.\n",
