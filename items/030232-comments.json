    "body": "@tromey What is your opinion on slice pretty-printing? Right now in gdb we don't pretty-print slices much, but we could. However, without indexing support hiding the data pointer can be counterproductive in case it is a slice of complicated structs. The same goes for Vec and String -- should we encode knowledge of the internals in GDB itself and handle both pretty printing and indexing? Or leave pretty printing up to Rust's pretty printers? Right now in general there is significant overlap between what rust-gdb does and what trunk gdb does; I'm wondering if the goal is to eliminate rust-gdb pretty printing entirely; and perhaps package convenience functions like `$unwrap()`\n",

    "body": "> @tromey What is your opinion on slice pretty-printing? Right now in gdb we don't pretty-print slices much, but we could. However, without indexing support hiding the data pointer can be counterproductive in case it is a slice of complicated structs. The same goes for Vec and String -- should we encode knowledge of the internals in GDB itself and handle both pretty printing and indexing? Or leave pretty printing up to Rust's pretty printers? Right now in general there is significant overlap between what rust-gdb does and what trunk gdb does; I'm wondering if the goal is to eliminate rust-gdb pretty printing entirely; and perhaps package convenience functions like $unwrap()\n\nMy view has been that types that are part of the language should be handled directly by gdb, while types from a library should be handled by pretty-printers; with `String` being a border case which should maybe be part of gdb.\n\nIt wasn't clear to me how gdb ought to print slices, so I left that alone.  It's easy to change this; if you can tell me what it should do, I can implement it.  Slice indexing ought to work already.\n\nSo, given this approach, there's still a useful role for `rust-gdb`.  However there are still some holes:\n- It would be nice not to need `rust-gdb` at all.  However, this is a pain given static linking and trying to find stuff in the filesystem.  Maybe the hook script could search `$PATH` for `rustc` or something along those lines.\n- `Vec` indexing doesn't work right now.  There are two possible solutions to this:\n  1. Change `rustc` to emit the needed trait information and then change gdb to implement various opcodes via trait lookup.  This would be great, with the (possibly minor) drawback that these operations would be inferior calls.\n  2. Add something akin to the `xmethod` support to gdb for Rust.  Then `rust-gdb` could implement indexing.\n",

    "body": "> It wasn't clear to me how gdb ought to print slices, so I left that alone. \n\nJust like an array, really, prefixed by `&` or `&mut`.\n\n> However, this is a pain given static linking and trying to find stuff in the filesystem. Maybe the hook script could search $PATH for rustc or something along those lines.\n\nNot sure what you mean here? Why do we need to look for rustc?\n\n>  There are two possible solutions to this:\n\nWell, two more:\n- Hardcode how to find the ptr/len in gdb. Brittle, though I don't expect the layout of Vec and String to change.\n- Expose convenience functions in std which can be called by GDB and LLDB. These are not generic -- they take a raw pointer to a vector and give you its length and data pointer. This is slightly better than the trait information thing because that function will not disappear on monomorphization. For example, Rust already has index trait methods in the debuginfo, which you can call, but they won't exist if the code doesn't index directly.\n\nIt seems like logically Vec/String handling should go in rust-gdb, since rust-gdb evolves with the stdlib (unlike gdb, which evolves independently). I do not like having rust-gdb continue existing; but I guess having a tiny rust-gdb with handling for string/vec and `$unwrap()` is okay. The convenience function solution is an alternative to this that lets rust-gdb disappear.\n\nMy main concern was indexing, but if you think it's possible to expose enough info to gdb python for this to work, I guess that's okay too.\n",
