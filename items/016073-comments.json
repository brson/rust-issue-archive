    "body": "Neat! This basically looks good to me, and I'm glad that the patch itself is mostly straightforward. @alexcrichton should look too.\n\nIt's unfortunate to add more 'cfg sprawl': it's already pretty messy and is only going to get worse. Both https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/185 (factoring out a platform abstraction layer specifically for the runtime) and https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/131 (flexible target specification) could help. @mneumann since you have fresh experience with porting Rust, if you have opinions about what would help porters, you might mention them on those bugs.\n",
