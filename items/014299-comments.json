    "body": "I was motivated to do this because I tried to write code and just used `.as_mut_ref()` without thinking about it, because that seemed to be the obvious name. I was surprised when it didn't work. And I think I was surprised because I've been trained by all those other methods to expect \"mut\" to be a qualifier that adds to a name, rather than replacing it. After all, we know what a \"mut ref\" is, so `as_mut_ref()` makes sense, but what is a \"mut\"?\n\nThe only context where `.as_mut()` makes sense to me is if it somehow returns a variant of the receiver that is mutable without adding any indirection (e.g. it would make sense for `RawPtr` to has `as_mut()`). But that doesn't apply to the existing `.as_mut()` methods.\n\nI would be interested to hear what @aturon has to say on this subject.\n",

    "body": "There's a clear convention about mutable variants of `as_foo` being `as_mut_foo`. \n\nOn the other hand, the `foo` is often an abbreviation or synonym for some type (e.g. `iter` for `Iterable`, `slice` for `&[T]`). From that perspective, shortening `mut_ref` to `mut` seems fine. The question is just whether we're comfortable abbreviating the type differently for different borrow styles.\n\nPersonally, I tend to agree with @kballard: part of the help of conventions is that you (and your finger muscles) don't have to remember special cases, even if that sometimes means typing more.\n\nTwo other points. \n- The placement of `mut` here is also under debate: see https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/13660. We may want to resolve these debates more globally.\n- This is also likely to be affected by whatever decision is reached on `uniq`/`mut`. \n",

    "body": "Some thoughts that went into the original decision:\n1. `as_mut_ref` is slightly redundant because there's not much mutable you can get other than a reference.\n2. `as_mut` has the same number of letters than `as_ref`.\n\nThey're not very strong arguments in the face of the rest of the standard library, however. I'd also be fine with resolving this ahead of #13660 and the mut/uniq debate. May as well get everything in to line first.\n",
