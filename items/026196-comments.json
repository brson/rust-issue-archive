    "body": "While it may be nice to have a comment to this effect, I don't think that this is a problem. The only time we actually look at the pointer is during iteration, and that only happens if the count/range returns an item. In the case that NULL is returned the count will be 0, so the pointer is never looked at. Additionally, `LocalFree` ignores NULL pointer arguments, so I don't think that there's actually a problem here.\n\nAll that being said, though, a comment would be nice.\n",
