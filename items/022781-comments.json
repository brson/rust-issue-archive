    "body": "Ok, so after a fair bit of investigation, I've found that this is a pretty complex bug. Fortunately, it's trivial to work around, for the example here doing `let x = match map.entry() { ... }; let x : &mut F = x;` works.\n\nThe issue seems to be related to coercions, though I can't quite figure out why your example fails, but my workaround, well works. The core of the issue is that the type of `F` (or more accurately, the version of `F` that is assigned to the match statement) seems to loose it's `'static` bound at some point and it gets replaced with an inferred region. Presumably this happens after region inference, but I'm not familiar enough with the code to be sure.\n\ncc @nikomatsakis @pnkfelix \n",
