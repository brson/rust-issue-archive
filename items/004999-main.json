  "body": "This patch series is doing a couple things with the ultimate goal of removing `#[allow(vecs_implicitly_copyable)]`, although I'm not quite there yet. The main change is passing around `@~str`s in most places, and using `ref`s in others. As far as I could tell, there are no performance changes with these patches, and all the tests pass on my mac.\n",
