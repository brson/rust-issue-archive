    "body": "So, I ended up deleting my `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and re-running configure and make. It is working now.\n\nIt looks like (maybe) there was a problem with my original `llvm` build, and it wasn't being cleaned when I ran `make clean`. When I removed the entire folder, it re-compiled llvm when I ran make, and it didn't hit the illegal instruction again. Ot it could have been `jemalloc`...\n\n@brson should `make clean` clean up the `llvm` & `jemalloc` build artifacts along with everything else?\n",
