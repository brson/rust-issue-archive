    "body": "I came across a related issue today, put an example of the problematic project here: https://github.com/davidrhyswhite/rust-structs-example\n\nEssentially when running `cargo run --example example` I get a linking error. The Parent struct is public has a public member called child which is a second struct with a public method. Calling `parent.child.method()` within the example causes a linking error.\n\nAlso a little more information from the rust IRC channel:\n\n```\ndavidrhyswhite - Don't suppose anyone could help me understand why I get a 'linking with cc failed exit code 1' when I have a struct nested inside another struct and attempt to call a method on the child struct?\ndavidrhyswhite - Have a git repo with an example here: https://github.com/davidrhyswhite/rust-structs-example\nkrdln          - davidrhyswhite: Changing mod child to pub mod child works. You should file a bug, but I'm not shure what should be expected behaviour\nmbrubeck       - davidrhyswhite: `cargo build` succeeds for me with only a dead_code warning\ndavidrhyswhite - Yeah cargo build was fine it was running 'cargo run --example example' that fails for me\nmbrubeck       - ah, got it\nkrdln          - davidrhyswhite: Changing `use child` into `pub use child` works too\ndavidrhyswhite - Awesome thanks krdln been stuck on this for a while\nmbrubeck       - davidrhyswhite: an example is compiled as a separate crate, so it can only call exported (`pub`) code from the main crate.\nmbrubeck       - It'd be nice to have better diagnostics instead of just a linker error in cases like this...\nkrdln          - davidrhyswhite: Rust should either forbid returning private things from public funtions, or it should forbid calling method in example. Either way, file a bug\ndavidrhyswhite - mbrubeck: Okay, but I though since the child member on the Parent struct was pub and the method was pub too it would allow me to call it\nkrdln          - davidrhyswhite: Notice that you get warned about Child::method when building a lib\nmbrubeck       - since `child::Child::method` is not a publicly-accessible path, it's not exported by the library, so other crates can't link to it.\naawe           - so the rust linker could use a patch for better error messages then\ndavidrhyswhite - mbrubeck: Thanks, that makes a bit more sense now.\nmbrubeck       - aawe: Yeah, it'd be nice if rustc could thrown an error while compiling example.rs, instead of waiting for linking to fail.\nmbrubeck       - The error is actually ends up coming from the system linker, gcc in my case.\n```\n",
