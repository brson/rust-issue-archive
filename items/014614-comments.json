    "body": "@alexcrichton I wonder if you can spell out the rationale for the current design? One of the things I was most confused about when first learning Rust was the various traits around strings, vectors, and slices. In particular, do you know why the `Str` and `Vector` traits exist?\n\nI am very much in favor of cutting down the number of traits for these core types. We should also think carefully about the naming here; we already have `str` and `String`, and the `Str` trait only adds to the confusion. It's also confusing that the `Vector` trait lives not in `vec` but in `slice`. Unfortunately, I don't have a great proposal offhand, but I'll think about it.\n\nDoes anyone see any downsides to doing the proposed merger?\n",

    "body": "These traits originally existed, to the best of my knowledge, to allow for `impl<T: Str> StrSlice for T`. Note that when these were written, default methods did not work, which is likely why default methods were not chosen. I view these traits as details that should never be thought about. No program should ever type the name of these traits, except for the libstd implementation itself. I think that rustdoc has gotten better in this respect, but it was lacking when these were written.\n\nI don't really see a reason for the duplication any more (as opposed to leveraging default methods). I also agree that the names should be chosen wisely. `StrSlice` and `Slice` seem like reasonable choices. Currently there is a distinction between `ImmutableSlice` and `MutableSlice`, but this will likely go away with DST. I don't think the name `Vector` is appropriate for a trait in `std::slice` any more.\n",

    "body": "Thanks @alexcrichton. I'll work on a patch soon and see if I run into lifetime troubles.\n\nMy worry about `Slice` in particular is that, to a newcomer, it's very confusing that `&[T]` is called a slice but then in the `slice` module there's also a trait called `Slice`, which in the proposed design is also implemented by `Vec`! The best alternative I can think of would be `Sliceable` (not a slice, but closely related), but it's not great.\n\nSome of these worries would be mitigated by having rustdoc pages for the actual slice and str types, though. (Didn't you recently land a patch for that? I don't see those in the docs, but maybe I'm missing something?)\n",

    "body": "tl;dr: the proposed implementation strategy is probably not viable.\n\n@huonw You're right: there are lifetime problems.\n\nThe current `StrSlice` trait takes a lifetime parameter and does some funny things with it:\n\n``` rust\ntrait StrSlice<'a> {\n    fn slice(&self, uint, uint) -> &'a str;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nNote that the lifetime of `self` here is arbitrary, yet the resulting subslice has the lifetime `'a` (which is tied to the original slice).\n\nNow suppose we want to add `as_slice`, and provide default methods that delegate to it. What should the signature be?\n\n``` rust\nfn as_slice(&self) -> &'a str;\nfn as_slice(&'a self) -> &'a str;\nfn as_slice<'b>(&'b self) -> &'b str;\n```\n\nUnfortunately, none of these options work:\n- The first option is impossible to implement for `String`, since it's basically saying that given a borrowed `&'b String` you can produce a `&'a str` for an arbitrary lifetime `'a`, which is wrong.\n- The other two options do not give sufficient lifetimes to implement the default methods, which (like `slice` above) often return longer lifetimes for their output than their input.\n\nWhy is `StrSlice` designed this way? \n\nConcretely, it means that examples like \n\n``` rust\nlet a = \"test\".to_str();\nlet mut b = a.as_slice();\nb = b.slice(1, 2);\n```\n\nwork, which rely on `b` having the same lifetime as the subslice `b.slice(1,2)`.\n\nPhilosophically, I think the point is that a slice already has a determined lifetime, which we want to record in the trait's type precisely to play the games above. So saying `impl<'a> StrSlice<'a> for String` just doesn't make sense, since it's promising that the `String` has any lifetime `'a` that you like, prior to actually turning it into a slice.\n\nOn the other hand, a design like \n\n``` rust\ntrait StrSlice {\n    fn slice<'a>(&'a self, uint, uint) -> &'a str;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\ncan be implemented for both `&str` and `String`, but is less flexible, since it wouldn't provide the longer lifetimes that today's `StrSlice` trait does.\n\nIn summary, I'm not sure that `&str` and `String` can share a common interface, because the methods on `&str` can (and should) provide stronger lifetime bounds.\n\ncc @nikomatsakis\n",
