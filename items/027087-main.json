  "body": "Refactors the \"desugaring\" of closures to expose the types of the upvars. This is necessary to be faithful with how actual structs work. The reasoning of the particular desugaring that I chose is explained in a fairly detailed comment.\n\nAs a side-effect, recursive closure types are prohibited unless a trait object intermediary is used. This fixes #25954 and also eliminates concerns about unrepresentable closure types that have infinite size, I believe. I don't believe this can cause regressions because of #25954.\n\n(As for motivation, besides #25954 etc, this work is also intended as refactoring in support of incremental compilation, since closures are one of the thornier cases encountered when attempting to split node-ids into item-ids and within-item-ids. The goal is to eliminate the \"internal def-id\" distinction in astdecoding. However, I have to do more work on trans to really make progress there.)\n\nr? @nrc \n",
