  "body": "Libcore's test infrastructure is complicated by the fact that many lang\nitems are defined in the crate. The current approach (realcore/realstd\nimports) is hacky and hard to work with (tests inside of core::cmp\nhaven't been run for months!).\n\nMoving tests to a separate crate does mean that they can only test the\npublic API of libcore, but I don't feel that that is too much of an\nissue. The only tests that I had to get rid of were some checking the\nvarious numeric formatters, but those are also exercised through normal\nformat! calls in other tests.\n",
