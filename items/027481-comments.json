Either way, running the playpen code would make it clear.\n\nFurthermore, this seems no more cyclic than eg. `#[derive(Clone)]`, which expands to an implementation of Clone when all the type parameters also implement Clone. In this case I want to implement ChangeSet when the type parameter C also implements ChangeSet.\n",
