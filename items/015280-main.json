  "body": "This commit changes `os` in two ways:\n- It adds a `join_paths` function that is the converse to `split_paths`,\n  easing manipulation of the `PATH` environment variable according to\n  platform conventions.\n- It changes `setenv` to take a `BytesContainer` rather than a `&str`\n  value, since environment variables may have non-utf8 values on some\n  platforms. Since `&str` is a `BytesContainer`, this is _not_ a\n  breaking change.\n\nAlong the way, it also refactors the `split_paths` function so that\n`cfg` switches are applied internally (and the function header is given\nonly once). This fixes a bug: the doc comment had an example for only\none platform.\n",
