    "body": "Yay, the glob test fails! That's because it's finally correct ;)\n\nGlob itself doesn't match properly against UTF-8 pathnames. It ignores them, and that's because the code was written to use strings. Line 136 of `libglob/lib.rs` contains a `// FIXME` explaining that it's ignoring non-utf8 filenames but that it really should be able to match them against a `*`.\n\nIt's also possible that `fs::readdir()` doesn't handle utf-8 filenames properly either. I don't know if there are any tests specifically on that functionality. Maybe you should duplicate your `test_non_utf8_glob` and modify it for `fs::readdir` (and stick it in the right mod).\n",
