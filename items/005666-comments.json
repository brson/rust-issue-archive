    "body": "I've been fiddling around with this example some more, here's what I've dug up.\n\nIf I instead store the vector as `~[@T as @Trait]`, the code works as expected.\n\nPrinting `[~T as ~Trait].len()` on a vector of `n` where `n` is greater than 1 yields `n +1`, as opposed to the actual length.\n\nPrinting the length on a vector `[@T as @Trait]` or `[&T as &Trait]` yields the actual length.\n\nAttempting to access an out of bounds index still panics as expected; so I believe the segmentation fault is a combination of using the iterator and the storage of `[~Trait]`\n",
