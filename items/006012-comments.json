    "body": "There's now a `CheckedDiv` trait, so I consider the implementation of the overflow checking itself to be complete.\n\nThe built-in integer types are defined as wrapping, but it's now easy to implement an alternate type expanding to a big integer on overflow like the integers in Python. I don't think it makes sense to take any other path, because as long as the type is restricted to fixed-size you need to consider behaviour on overflow.\n\nIf there is a specific proposal, that can be opened as an issue. There have been many discussions about this with a consistent consensus that overflow checking is too high a cost to pay. The only full solution is an unbounded integer type, and that comes with the baggage of out-of-memory if you aren't checking inputs.\n",
