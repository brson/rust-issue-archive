  "body": "This implements RFC 39. Omitted lifetimes in return values will now be\ninferred to more useful defaults, and an error is reported if a lifetime\nin a return type is omitted and one of the two lifetime elision rules\ndoes not specify what it should be.\n\nThis primarily breaks two uncommon code patterns. The first is this:\n\n```\nunsafe fn get_foo_out_of_thin_air() -> &Foo {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThis should be changed to:\n\n```\nunsafe fn get_foo_out_of_thin_air() -> &'static Foo {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThe second pattern that needs to be changed is this:\n\n```\nenum MaybeBorrowed<'a> {\n    Borrowed(&'a str),\n    Owned(String),\n}\n\nfn foo() -> MaybeBorrowed {\n    Owned(format!(\"hello world\"))\n}\n```\n\nChange code like this to:\n\n```\nenum MaybeBorrowed<'a> {\n    Borrowed(&'a str),\n    Owned(String),\n}\n\nfn foo() -> MaybeBorrowed<'static> {\n    Owned(format!(\"hello world\"))\n}\n```\n\nCloses #15552.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nr? @nick29581\n",
