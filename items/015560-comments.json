    "body": "The library have the notion of a [runtime](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rt/trait.Runtime.html) which is provided by all rust tasks. Any service provided by the runtime will require a local task be available. Some examples are:\n- Descheduling/rescheduling (channels, sync::lock, etc)\n- task-local-data\n- I/O\n- task spawning\n\nThe public primitives in `sync` are all built on task descheduling/rescheduling to work properly across multiple scheduling models, hence requiring a local task to be available.\n\nYou may be interested in [`std::rt::mutex`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rt/mutex/) which are bindings to the native lock, be it pthreads or the windows equivalent.\n\nThis definition and line of \"what it means to be a task\" is constantly evolving over time, so I'm going to close this for now as not particularly actionable. This is somewhat decently covered by http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rt/ and http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide-runtime.html today, but specific improvements would always be welcome!\n",
