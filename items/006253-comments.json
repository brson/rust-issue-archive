    "body": "I was successful in cloning libuv directly and building it, yet during the Rust build it has the above error.  It looks like libuv itself can handle detection of mingw properly, see -> https://github.com/joyent/libuv/blob/master/config-mingw.mk\n\nThe build somehow misses the libuv/include path on mingw windows build.  (I proved this by commenting out the windowsy part and it found the include path when looking as a /src/unix build...  so something is amiss between lines 163 - 173 in rt.mk\n\nHope that helps.\n",
