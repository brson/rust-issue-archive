  "body": "r? @graydon\n\nThis series changes the build such that libraries are not completely rebuilt when testing. Instead, the tests are built into the libraries, and driver.rs is modified to run the tests directly out of them. It should make cycle times faster.\n\nThis will add some binary size to the libraries, but I figure we can have a 'release mode' some day that doesn't build them. It will also slightly increase the normal, non-testing, build times.\n\nTo make this work I modified `rustc::front::test` to fold in the test modifications any time the 'test' cfg is active, allowing the test modifications to be performed on libraries in addition to executables (previously this was only done with the `--test` flag, which turns on both `--cfg test` and `--bin`).\n\nMeasurements forthcoming.\n",
