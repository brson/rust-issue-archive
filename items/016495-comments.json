    "body": "Yes; a lot of data types build on slices and `Vec`, and thus their iterators store `items::Slice`. I have found circumstances where one wants to initialise with an empty iterator; and it takes a bit of knowledge to write it safely.\n\n([Example](https://github.com/reem/rust-n-tree/blob/a1c43db0b08fd8bfc76f1e8343acee061369212a/src/lib.rs#L107): a tree iterator where each leaf is a vector of elements; an empty iterator in that position indicates the iterator needs to find the next relevant leaf. It's much simpler to [have all that in one place](https://github.com/reem/rust-n-tree/blob/a1c43db0b08fd8bfc76f1e8343acee061369212a/src/lib.rs#L185-L223) than duplicate it for an initial search in the constructor function.)\n\nIn any case, `(&[]).iter()` works so this is not necessary.\n",
