    "body": "The current design of rustdoc has explicitly avoided a second metadata blob which is required for interim processing. The reason for this is that we all of a sudden need to start distributing `std.json` along with all other libraries, or `rustdoc foo.rs` doesn't work out-of-the-box.\n\nThis problem can be worked around, but this is my largest concern if moving to a interim-json system.\n\nAlso, can you explain more what this model buys us? I'm not particularly sold on deterministic `make -j` output, and it's not clear to me what this would buy us in terms of an improved cross-crate experience.\n",

    "body": "I can't speak for chris, but here are the advantages I can see from emitting a metadata blob:\n- it can be used for various other tools other than HTML emitting (eg: automatic blanket impl code generation in editor \u00e0 la IntellijIdea pop to mind, or completion with embedded documentation \u00e0 la VisualStudio)\n- it can also be used by crates.io in order to check any API breakage and enforce semver, or by the community to evaluate documentation coverage\n- it can be used in any organization to embed the rust doc in any other platform (see devdocs.io as an example)\n- it enable the community to build new tools which consume the json rather than having to hack on the rustc tree. I think most of the competent frontends guys might be a little bit scared by the rustc repo. :)\n- it can help with #29323, #15470\n\nIn order to to smooth the process, rustdoc could embed the std.doc.json and core.doc.json in the binary so that it would work as long as no cli argument provide other jsons. It need the rustc tree to be compiled anyway...\n",
