  "body": "This commit tweaks the interface of the `std::env` module to make it more\nergonomic for common usage:\n- `env::var` was renamed to `env::var_os`\n- `env::var_string` was renamed to `env::var`\n- `env::args` was renamed to `env::args_os`\n- `env::args` was re-added as a panicking iterator over string values\n- `env::vars` was renamed to `env::vars_os`\n- `env::vars` was re-added as a panicking iterator over string values.\n\nThis should make common usage (e.g. unicode values everywhere) more ergonomic\nas well as \"the default\". This is also a breaking change due to the differences\nof what's yielded from each of these functions, but migration should be fairly\neasy as the defaults operate over `String` which is a common type to use.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
