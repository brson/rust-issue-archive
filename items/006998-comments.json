    "body": "#7007 fixes the problem in our part of the build system, but we need to fix an issue with jemalloc's build system before this starts working. It has an autoconf check to test for the page size on the platform, but it bails out and fails to configure if you're cross-compiling.\n\nWe need to hardcode the shift size for the platforms we're targeting. I'm not entirely sure what the best way would be to pass it to jemalloc's build system - autotools is weird.\n",
