  "body": "Not ready to land, in any way.\n\nThis is a resurrection and heavy revision/expansion of a PR that pcwalton did to resolve #8861.\n\nI am just putting this up to get some early review feedback from Niko.\n\nI put in some commits today that address some necessary fallout that I had been missing.  I had previously overlooked a number of tests that were not being run because the test suite was getting hung up on a case of exponential time blowup (I think) in the dropck code for which I put in a quick work-around.  (I think pcwalton\u2019s original branch was the one that introduced the \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d field to avoid non-termination; the workaround further exploits the breadcrumbs structure to try to avoid unnecessary retraversals.  It seems to have done the trick.\n\nThere may still be yet more fallout to be addressed; https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust/commit/31cec2791babe227b9db2d5a1a9ad3b734e45afa is an example of the kind of fix that I hope will be the most that will be required on a case-by-case basis.  (The more extreme kind of fix is illustrated by https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust/commit/5dd63c1e17a1c3b16b47920c87ced1e48cb3755a but I _really_ hope there are not many occurrences of that sort of thing in the tests.)\n\nAlso obviously the `src/libst2/` stuff was just a skeletal clone of libstd to help me track down some issues when I was getting this bootstrapped; it obviously will be deleted in the real PR.\n",
