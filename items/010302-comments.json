All the *nixes do this in a bit different way with the most annoying one being OS X where you only can set the name from _within_ the thread and the function is only available since OS X 10.6. It seems Linux and BSDs are okay though.\n\nSource: [this SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369738/can-i-set-the-name-of-a-thread-in-pthreads-linux).\n",
