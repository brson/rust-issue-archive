    "body": "The program you've linked to is actually exhibiting memory corrupting, likely leading to the oddness that you're seeing. [This line](https://github.com/Nullreff/argsexample/blob/master/main.rs#L19) is creating a `CString`, getting a pointer to it, and then deallocating the `CString` (as it is a temporary). This means that all the pointers passed to C are dangling references.\n\nYou'll probably want to create a `Vec<CString>` on the stack and then from that create a `Vec<*const c_char>`, for example:\n\n``` rust\nlet args = args().map(|arg| CString::new(arg).unwrap()).collect::<Vec<_>>();\nlet arg_ptrs = args.iter().map(|arg| arg.as_ptr()).collect::<Vec<_>>();\nunsafe {\n    printargs(arg_ptrs.len(), arg_ptrs.as_ptr());\n}\n```\n\nMore information about this footgun can be found in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/16035.\n",
