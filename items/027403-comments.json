    "body": "@eefriedman I suppose in that case I'd consider the conflict to come from the provider of the `From` impl, and give an error when that downstream crate attempted to build (ie: I'm declaring an impl of `Into<S>` that already exists when that crate builds).\n\nIt might be helpful to note that with the current way the compiler thinks about things, `Into<S>` can't be implemented for any `S` which I don't control (as the only way to implement it is by impl-ing `From` on `S`). This rather reduces the flexibility here, and means I'll probably end up just having `into()` methods that aren't members of `trait Into`. Perhaps we should have an `IntoWithoutDefaults`? That seems like an undesirable workaround.\n\nEdit: note, I haven't thought about the above enough to know if it is possible.\n\nEdit2: and just realized that the behavior I'm looking for in the first paragraph is similar in functionality to negative trait bounds.\n",
