  "body": "Right now, when you look in the \"Implementors\" section for traits, you only see\nimplementors within that crate. This commit modifies that section to include\nimplementors from neighboring crates as well.\n\nFor example, the Container trait currently says that it is only implemented by\nstrings and slices, but it is in fact implemented by nearly all containers.\n\nImplementation-wise, this change generates an \"implementors cache\" similarly to\nthe search index where each crate will append implementors to the files. When\nthe page for a trait is loaded, it will load its specific cache file, rendering\nlinks for all upstream types which implement the trait.\n",
