    "body": "See [this comment](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11979#issuecomment-34260627) by @FlaPer87. I am of the opinion that we can loosen the rules slightly. The idea would be that we restrict the _values_ created in a static initializer (in other words, we restrict constant expressions) such that they never create a value that would need to run the destructor:\n- No `box`, `~`, or `@` constructors\n- No struct constructors that have a dtor\n- Anything else? (I think not)\n\nThis ensures that we never have to run dtors on static items, because we know they'd have no effect. Then we have to modify codegen to distinguish static item lvalues and not zero those out. That's a bit annoying. Of course it's temporary until #5016 is done.\n\nI'd still prefer to enforce the _additional_ requirement that `static mut` types are always POD. This is because, in a static mut value, even if we guarantee that it's initial value requires no destructor to be run, we can't make that guarantee for things that are assigned later. \n",
