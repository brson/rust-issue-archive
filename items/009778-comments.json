    "body": "Looks good to me, thanks!\n\nCould you also add a test to make sure that functionality like this doesn't regress? It would involve adding a test file to `src/test/compile-fail` with a directive of the form `//~ ERROR: my text here`.\n\nThere should be lots of examples in adjacent files (although ignore the ones with `error-pattern`, it's not as precise of an error check), and if you need any help feel free to ping me on IRC (`acrichto`) or comment here.\n\nAlso, could you put the words `Closes #6580` in the commit message as well? That'll appease github to auto-close the issue as soon as this is merged into master.\n",
