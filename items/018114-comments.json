    "body": "The intrinsics is _not_ meant to be used directly so I don't think it should be organized in that module. If we are not going to export them all in a single `extern` block, then they might as well be in the modules where they belong like `ptr` as implementation details. It's a really bad idea to expose them directly because they will become a defacto standard regardless of the stability attributes, despite it being a compiler implementation detail that these are not normal functions. Some of these may no longer be intrinsics in the future...\n",
