  "body": "This branch implements a variant of trans that is based on MIR. It is very incomplete (intentionally), and had only the goal of laying out enough work to enable more incremental follow-on patches. Currently, only fns tagged with `#[rustc_mir]` use the new trans code. I plan to build up a meta-issue as well that tracks the various \"not-yet-implemented\" points. The only fn that has been tested so far is this amazingly complex \"spike\" fn:\n\n``` rust\n#[rustc_mir]\nfn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {\n    x + y\n}\n```\n\nIn general, the most interesting commit is the last one. There are some points on which I would like feedback from @rust-lang/compiler:\n- I did not use `Datum`. Originally, I thought that maybe just a `ValueRef` would be enough but I wound up with two very simple structures, `LvalueRef` and `OperandRef`, that just package up a `ValueRef` and a type. Because of MIR's structure, you don't wind up mixing by-ref and by-value so much, and I tend to think that a thinner abstraction layer is better here, but I'm not sure.\n- Related to the above, I expect that sooner or later we will analyze temps (and maybe variables too) to find those whose address is never taken and which are word-sized and which perhaps meet a few other criteria. For those, we'll probably want to avoid the alloca, just because it means prettier code.\n- I generally tried to re-use data structures from elsewhere in trans, though I'm sure we can trim these down.\n- I didn't do any debuginfo primarily because it seems to want node-ids and we have only spans. I haven't really read into that code so I don't know what's going on there.\n\nr? @nrc \n",
