    "body": "As a general principle, I think that for performance reasons, there should always be a \"never-fails\" version of all important language primitives. The reason is that it is common for developers to want a version that can't fail, and if the language/library doesn't offer one then the developer has to write a function to do it himself. Then what happens is, the developer checks the arguments, and then the compiler or std lib does exactly the same check a second time, which is just wasteful in an inner loop. Plus, the compiler has to spend a little extra time inlining this little function everywhere.\n\nOf course, a version that fails on unexpected input is equally useful and should also be provided. IMO, then, there should be three slice functions: two fast (unsigned with fail, unsigned without fail) and one slower and more flexible (python style). But then you would have more arguing to do about naming. Mind you, I didn't catch how slices work in Rust -- I'm assuming it's like Go where a slice is merely a pointer and a length, no copying involved. If a slice actually copies the whole range then it was silly of me to worry about the speed of the range checks.\n",
