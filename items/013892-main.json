  "body": "Currently, rustc requires that a linkage be a product of 100% rlibs or 100%\ndylibs. This is to satisfy the requirement that each object appear at most once\nin the final output products. This is a bit limiting, and the upcoming libcore\nlibrary cannot exist as a dylib, so these rules must change.\n\nThe goal of this commit is to enable _some_ use cases for mixing rlibs and\ndylibs, primarily libcore's use case. It is not targeted at allowing an\nexhaustive number of linkage flavors.\n\nThere is a new dependency_format module in rustc which calculates what format\neach upstream library should be linked as in each output type of the current\nunit of compilation. The module itself contains many gory details about what's\ngoing on here.\n\ncc #10729\n",
