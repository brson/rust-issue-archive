These are typically really well defined, stable, have no external dependencies, are easy to implement and test, useful in a slew of contexts, and take little space to implement.\n\nThe EBML code in libstd is 229 lines of code and consumes 4035 bytes of compiled code in the resulting library.\n\nWe've also discussed these libraries arriving in libstd before:\n\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-wanted-libraries\n\nand, fwiw, \"large standard libraries\" seem to be the norm in recent languages. See python, ruby, go standard libraries:\n\nhttp://docs.python.org/library/\nhttp://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/\nhttp://golang.org/pkg/\n\nAbout the only things new languages are shying away from in the standard libraries are desktop-GUI libraries like QT and GTK (at least, any beyond tk). Because those usually outmass the remainder of the library, are very project-specific, and typically bring their _own_ standard libraries along for the ride.\n",
