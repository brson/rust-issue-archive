So a closure could never obtain a mutable reference to a Chan or Port, which means it would never be able to call, for example, channel.send(&mut self, x). Of course there are tricks such as transmute_mut, but perhaps it would be better for this issue to remain unfixed until closures can capture mutable references.\n",
