    "body": "I think you're right, you could completely remove reserve() here with no problem. I can take a look.\n\n> This does actually have a very large functional change... The amount of memory that's zeroed between calls to read now grows without bound.\n\nIt was growing without bound before as well. Since reserve() always rounds up to the nearest power of 2. After you reallocate with 16, you are rounded up to a power of two- then you double, then you double, etc, since you keep rounding up to the next power of two.\n\nFor example- let's say we start with 1000 bytes. In the code before this PR, it requests 16 bytes, and is rounded up to 1024 bytes total. Then it requests 32 and is rounded up to 2048. Then it requests 64 and is rounded up to 5096. etc.\n\n> In the current implementation, we'll zero 64KB, so have wasted 64KB - 1 byte of zeroing work. On the other hand, this PR will bump the wasted work to 64MB - 1 byte. In general, the amount of wasted work is going to scale with the size of the file which seems not great\n\nIf you only consider the last call to reserve/realloc what you are saying is true. But there are a lot of reallocs before the last realloc, and a WHOLE lot more for the case where we increase by a constant than if we double every time. Perhaps my explanation with a geometric series/triangular numbers was convoluted, Dr. Dobbs has an article about it http://www.drdobbs.com/c-made-easier-how-vectors-grow/184401375. The doubling pattern is O(n) whereas the increase by a constant is O(n^2). Ie increasing by a constant scales FAR worse with the size of the file.\n",
