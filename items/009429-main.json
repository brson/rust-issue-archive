  "body": "`Mut<T>` implements an internally mutable slot, using `#[no_freeze]` and `transmute_mut`. It is much like Cell without the nullable part. It implements dynamic borrow checking, which is just an enum counting the current readers and writers.\n\n`Mut<T>` provides methods `.borrow() -> ReadPtr<'a, T>` and `.borrow_mut() -> WritePtr<'a, T>` to obtain a wrapped borrowed pointer. These wrapped pointers have destructors that update the borrow flag in the `Mut<T>` when they go out of scope. Several `ReadPtr` can be alive at the same time.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nlet obj = Mut::new(5);\n{\n    let mut m_ptr = obj.borrow_mut();\n    *m_ptr.get() = 7;\n}\ndo obj.map |t| {  println!(\"value: {}\", *t) }\n```\n\nFor convenience, and to remove Cell, extra methods are implemented on `Mut<Option<U>>` that make it easy to treat it like an optional value. When replacing Cell's `.take()`, the only overhead of `Mut<T>` at the moment is the destructor function call of `util::NonCopyable` that's inserted.\n\n`Mut<T>` is more generic than `Cell<T>`, and so can replace it better when it is used as an actual mutable slot. This represents very few previous users of Cell in the tree (see commit https://github.com/blake2-ppc/rust/commit/4f8c5b1954aef4e01c40935708757373d9b04b6f )\n\n`Mut<T>` is also used to replace `extra::rc::RcMut<T>` with `Rc<Mut<T>>`. This requires a further restriction for cycle prevention (unless I'm mistaken) so that only `T: Send` values are allowed inside `Rc<Mut<T>>`. (This is because `Rc<Mut<T>>` _is_ `Freeze`, while `RcMut<T>` was not.)\n### Clarifications and Known issues:\n- It doesn't merge. I'll wait for #9359 before rebasing, and I'll update the commit messages to be more detailed.\n- The `BorrowFlag` enum is 16 bytes and is too large. This can be solved inelegantly by simply using an integer.\n- `Mut<T>` should be noncopyable because it needs to clear the borrow status when cloned.\n- For pcwalton: the name `Mutable<T>` was not possible since it conflicts with `std::container::Mutable`\n### Requests for comment:\n- Cell<T> is replaced with a more fundamental type while 90% of users don't need this. Should Cell stay with just the constructor and the single method `.take()`?  This represents the use case where closures wish to modify their moved-in upvalues.\n- Is it acceptable for a type to have both `impl<T> Mut<T>` and `impl<U> Mut<Option<U>>` ?\n- Should `Mut<T>` allow multiple `ReadPtr` (and thus it has to count them)?\n",
