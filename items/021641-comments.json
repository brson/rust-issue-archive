    "body": "So to clarify: unsafe code must never panic at any point which might leave an object in an invalid state, even if the destructor to that object can handle that invalid state correctly? If that's true, it should really be documented in the section on unsafe code (which currently just advises putting using asserts liberally in unsafe code, and is a sure way to cause panics in the wrong place!).\n\nIt also seems difficult to guarantee as someone writing unsafe code, because there's no way to tell which methods might panic - that information is not even included in the documentation in most cases.\n",
