In Servo I found the `Freeze` bound on `MutexArc` to be very annoying because it tries too hard to prevent cycles, despite the fact that I know what I'm doing, and I just wrote a safe wrapper around `unsafe_access` because otherwise I just couldn't do what I needed to do.\n\nWe have never prevented memory leaks in Rust. You can always leak memory by, for example, having two tasks in an infinite loop ping ponging each other repeatedly. We just make it hard to leak memory in practice because we encourage use of data structures that don't leak (unique ownership, and in the future `Gc` pointers). Trying too hard to prevent memory leaks just leads to people who know what they're doing write annoying unsafe wrappers.\n",
