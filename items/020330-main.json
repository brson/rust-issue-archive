  "body": "This patch resolves the second problem mentioned in #15877: function calls to integers, e.g. `3.b()`.\n\n It does so, by checking whether the character following the first dot of a FLOAT_LIT is a character or an underscore (these should denote a valid identifier). This does not look like a particularly, but it seems like a lookahead of 1 is needed for this distinction. \n\nAnother interesting aspect are ranges that start with a integer constant, but end with a function call, e.g. `1..b()`. Rust treats this as a range from 1 to `b()`, but given that `1.` is a valid FLOAT_LIT, `1..b()` could be a function call to a float as well.\n\ncc @cmr \n",
