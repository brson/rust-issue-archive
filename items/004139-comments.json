    "body": "So, there is a larger issue here.  In general I am nervous about \"negative logic\" in type rules.  That is, saying something like \"this is ok because type X does NOT have this property\" (in this case, copy-ness) vs \"this is ok because type X DOES have this property\".  This is because it leads to non-monotonicity which tends to create complications when things are combined.\n\nAll that said, I think in the abstract it's ok for coherence to consider a type variable T:U and some type X that does not implement U as disjoint.  This is because of coherence itself, basically, which ensures that since both X and U are defined in crates that we know about, if there was any impl of U for X, we'd be able to see it.  So we can't screw up crate linking this way\n\nBut _that_ said, supporting this sort of reasoning in coherence is complicated.  It requires nested checks.  We need to be very careful to ensure termination in these kinds of scenarios (but we probably have to anyhow, long story).  Perhaps just supporting this reasoning for the built-in kinds is an acceptable compromise.\n",
