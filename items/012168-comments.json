Why does `from_utf8_owned` need to carry all this baggage?\n\nIf you need to be able to recover from invalid utf-8 and either know the valid utf8 prefix, or keep the `~[u8]`, then you should be using something like the original proposed API that returns the index of the first invalid character. With that API you can produce the valid prefix and the remainder yourself. But most uses of `from_utf8_owned` don't seem to have any need for this extra baggage, and thus shouldn't be complicated by a crazy return value, especially not one that allocates. `from_utf8_owned` consumes the `~[u8]` and does not allocate, and this error changes that.\n",
