The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @huonw (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

We simply assume that in case of panic, something will come along and read the vector as it is, so its length must never be set so that it exposes uninitialized memory, regardless of when or how we leave the function.\n\nTo be defensive, we should probably assume there exists a panic case somewhere in the Stdin and File code, instead of auditing it for not being present (an analysis that would go out of date anyway).\n\nThe way to do that would be (in the uninitialized case at least), to slice outside the length of the vector, and only update the vector length after the reader has written into that slice successfully.\n",
