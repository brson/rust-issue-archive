    "body": "Can Chan be a trait?  We used to have GenericChan, but that got axed in the last rewrite.\n\nOne use case example: https://github.com/jfager/d3cap/blob/master/multicast.rs#L67 - transparently wrapping sends in an enum the reader on the port end knows how to handle but that the sender shouldn't care about.\n\nNot sure if this is sufficiently motivating, and would probably still need the non-blocking vs blocking distinction in the trait spec as the api would of course be different.   \n",
