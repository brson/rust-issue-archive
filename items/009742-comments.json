    "body": "Thanks for getting to this so quickly! I have a question about the fix. It seems like this was the only use of `assert_once_ever` in the libraries. Is this a general problem that will occur with all uses of `assert_once_ever` in the future? If so, would it be worth removing the macro, or modifying it to be `assert_once_for_this_runtime_invocation` (in the spirit of #7748)?\n",
