    "body": "Oh I see, you pointed out the languages that have it (including D, I didn't see!) but just think it's inconsistently used. Hmm. I dunno. This is a syntax extension. It's not like you're going to call it without awareness of what it's for. I guess I'm curious what else you'd want here instead? The use case is:\n\n```\nconst CODE_FOO : u8 = iota!();\nconst CODE_BAR : u8 = iota!();\n// ...\nconst CODE_QUUX : u8 = iota!();\n```\n\nIn order to define an arbitrary sequence of values that you don't care about the numbering of, just \"one more than previous\". Similar to use in an enum. I suppose most of the time this can be done as:\n\n```\nconst CODE_FOO : u8 = 0;\nconst CODE_BAR : u8 = CODE_FOO + 1;\nconst CODE_BAR : u8= CODE_BAZ + 1;\n...\n```\n\nIt's just a lot wordier (have to repeat each variant) and more prone to copy-paste errors.\n",

    "body": "I am not quite sure why we need `iota`. It seems to me the reason Go uses iota is because it lacks `enum`s. If there's still need for it, however, I would suggest something like\n\n`iota!(u8, FOO, BAR, BAZ)`\n\nas it would make the resets clear. One can also align the argument like\n\n```\niota!(u8, FOO,\n          BAR,\n          ...)\n```\n",
