  "body": "This _almost_ completes the job for #16440. The idea is that even if we do not know whether some closure type `C` implements `Fn` or `FnMut` (etc), we still know its argument and return types. So if we see an obligation `C : Fn(_0)`, we can unify `_0` with those argument types while still considering the obligation ambiguous and unsatisfied. This helps to make a lot of progress with type inference even before closure kind inference is done.\n\nAs part of this PR, the explicit `:` syntax is removed from the AST and completely ignored. We still infer the closure kind based on the expected type if that is available. There are several reasons for this. First, deciding the closure kind earlier is always better, as it allows us to make more progress. Second, this retains a (admittedly obscure) way for users to manually specify the closure kind, which is useful for writing tests if nothing else. Finally, there are still some cases where inference can fail, so it may be useful to have this manual override. (The expectation is that we will eventually revisit an explicit syntax for specifying the closure kind, but it will not be `:` and may be some sort of generalization of the `||` syntax to handle other traits as well.)\n\nThis commit does not _quite_ fix #16640 because a snapshot is still needed to enable the obsolete syntax errors for explicit `&mut:` and friends.\n\nr? @eddyb as he reviewed the prior patch in this direction\n",
