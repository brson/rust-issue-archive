    "body": "why remove free-standing numeric functions? They are the most intuitive definition of numerical operation. A numerical function does not act on a number (it does not change it), but it maps it to an element form the same or different set. An expression like 2.0f32.sin() is ugly, hard to read and would probably prevent a lot of people (including me) to ever use rust for numerical applications. \nYou might follow the goal to make rust more consistent but the notation used for numerical functions is very mature and even consistent among different computer languages so in my option it should remain an exception if needed.\nAlso, as a welcome side effect those free-standing function prevent a misleading use of function names like exp, sin and so on. We can consider them to be reserved for their classical meaning.\n",

    "body": "I agree with you @Casorati partially.\n\nSyntax-wise I think we should allow for the `sin(x)` option in addition to `x.sin()`. What will be the 'default' way to call mathematical functions can then be decided by the community.\n\nBut I also think it is very important to remove the current free-standing numeric functions. Currently there are at least three different `sin(x)` which doesn't make sense to me.\n\nThe sane way to implement the numeric functions is to\n1. First remove the free-standing functions.\n2. Then add new generic functions that implement `sin(x)` &c. for all types that implement x.sin().\n\nPs. @bjz, could you split up this PR into two? The two groups of changes are completely orthogonal.\n",
