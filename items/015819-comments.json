    "body": "It seems like this could be a lint, although we may need a way to run it earlier in the pipeline.  That opens up the possibility of reusing some of the machinery in plugins to enforce style and code structure.  Perhaps there's a nice declarative language for describing valid and invalid AST shapes.\n\n> The first two should, IMO, be opt-in, since most users won't want to be wasting the compilation time on something that _should_ never trigger if they're not writing their own macros.\n\nMy hunch is that the compile time won't be significant, unless our invariants are _really_ complex.  Converting the lint system from one pass to several dozen increased the compile time for librustc (before it was split up) by about half a second.  It's hard to do anything syntax-focused that takes significant time compared to trans and LLVM. (_edit_: sorry, not dozens of passes, but a bunch of virtual calls at each step of the traversal)\n",
