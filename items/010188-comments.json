    "body": "A lot of pain? :)\n\nHow would these get used? My understanding was that they would disambiguate multiple crates so that two versions of the same library could be loaded at once (if I depended on X version 1 and some dependency of mine depended on X version 2, they could both have what they wanted, instead of beign out of luck unless all dependency requirements matched). I'm not sure how one would use this though, or what this buys over a version number.\n",

Anyone else want this?  If not, I'll take a look into it, see if it's something I can do.  As simple as it sounds right now, I haven't read enough of the compiler code to be sure...\n\nOf course, there's not even any assurance this is wanted, but I feel that just removing it from the library file name could be a good start point.  I've definitely had a couple times I've tried to use libraries and had conflicts, and if none of it is used, removal of that metadata sounds good, even if it does end up temporary,\n",

    "body": "From my understanding of the wiki @huonw pointed out and the comment in the code, the only real reason for a hash in the crate name is for two same-named crates to actually be different libraries. I could create my own `libstd` and because it's location (pkgid) was different than rust's libstd, the two libraries would have different filenames (because the hash is different).\n\nThis seems a little nice, but it may not be worth having to explain to everyone why we have this weird hash in the crates (and this makes writing scripts working on crates incredibly difficult). It's worth considering this use case though.\n",

    "body": "That use case actually makes a lot of sense, and solves a real problem. In that case, the hash can be absolutely predictable, since you can just use the linkid UUID for the hash and require those be unique. Unfortunately using a UUID here would greatly expand the size of the hash value.\n\nIf the hash is predictable, all the problems of using it pretty much disappear. The problem right now is that the output of compilation is effectively a randomly named file with a known prefix. It's easy enough to grep the link args out of a file to determine the filename needed.\n",

This makes sense, also taking into account the fact that for (far future) system-wide libraries, the soname space is shared also with non-rust libraries.\n\nAs the hash is expected to be static (like the library name and in opposition to the library version/interface signature), I'd like to adopt @metajack proposal: re-use the first group of the crate UUID as the hash. This gives us 8 random alphadigits with a low probability of collision, which are statically defined and known to rustpkg, as well as short and easily greppable. Eg, this will result in a `libhttp-d2ad8df0.so.0.1-pre` for the current httplib version.\n",

    "body": "The link metadata is supposed to be disappearing (see https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/8523), so using a UUID from that is probably not the best.\n\nHere's what I propose:\n1. Change `#[link(package_id=\"...\")];` to `#[pkgid=\"...\"];`\n2. Remove all link metadata\n3. Calculate the CMH with SHA1(pkgid)\n4. Calculate the STH(sym) with SHA1(CMH + type_str(sym))\n5. For libraries, the output name is NAME-CMH-VERSION or NAME-CMH depending on whether the pkgid contains a version.\n\nThis means:\n- the hash is completely predictable and easily calculated. either you can grep it out of lib.rs or you can hardcode the package id in a build script.\n- name collisions for different package ids with the same name are avoided (important for /usr/lib use case)\n- libraries that don't contain a version in the pacakge id won't conflict with ones that do.\n\nWhat do you think?\n",
