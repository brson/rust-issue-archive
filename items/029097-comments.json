I think can be a lint. . .\n\nI mean, I admit, it is a little difficult to make the call in each of these cases.\n\n## Lifetime Shadowing\n\nThe basis for the label-shadowing one is that we _might_ (with >50% probability) in the future want to actually use labels to denote block lifetimes and allow for writing them in borrow expressions. But to use labels for that purpose, you _really_ don't want to have duplicates.\n\n(Now, maybe another answer here, just in the name of backwards-compatibility, will be to disable that future extension to the language in the context of a function that has such duplicate labels...)\n\n## Pattern Binding and Variant Identifier Collision\n\nWould we ever make this a hard error?  I don't know; its not like the rule is as simple as \"an identifier is always a binding form in a pattern.\"\n\nBut I would be willing to bet that there is less than 50% chance that we would ever make this a hard error in the future, and therefore it makes sense to provide the capability to disable the warning, and therefore it makes sense to revise it as a proper lint.\n",
