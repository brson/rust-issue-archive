  "body": "Environment variables are global state so this can lead to surprising results if\nthe driver is called in a multithreaded environment (e.g. doctests). There\nshouldn't be any memory corruption that's possible, but a lot of the bots have\nbeen failing because they can't find `cc` or `gcc` in the path during doctests,\nand I highly suspect that it is due to the compiler modifying `PATH` in a\nmultithreaded fashion.\n\nThis commit moves the logic for appending to `PATH` to only affect the child\nprocess instead of also affecting the parent, at least for the linking stage.\nWhen loading dynamic libraries the compiler still modifies `PATH` on Windows,\nbut this may be more difficult to fix than spawning off a new process.\n",
