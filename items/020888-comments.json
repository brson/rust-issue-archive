    "body": "The function is actually currently unstable, not deprecated. We chose to conservatively not stabilize this function before alpha, but we can certainly revisit that decision!\n\nThis issue isn't particularly actionable, and I think that the stability of this function will certainly come up during the discussion of your RFC as well as #20031, so I'm going to close this for now.\n",
