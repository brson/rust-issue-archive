    "body": "[RFC 141](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0141-lifetime-elision.md]) says that \"a _lifetime position_ is anywhere you can write a lifetime in a type\".  According to that rule, `fn(m: &(Sized+'static)) -> &i8` is ambiguous because there are two lifetime positions in the input, and this isn't a bug.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm pretty sure that isn't actually what we want, so we need a more precise rule which specifies exactly what lifetimes qualify as a \"lifetime position\".\n\nOther random observations: nightly accepts the following, but stable doesn't:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    type T<'a> = &'a &'a i8;\n    fn s(m: T) -> &i8 { m }\n    static S: i8 = 1;\n    static S2: &'static i8 = &S;\n    s(&S2);\n}\n```\n\nNeither nightly nor stable accept the following:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    type T<'a> = &'a &'static i8;\n    fn s(m: T) -> &i8 { m }\n    static S: i8 = 1;\n    static S2: &'static i8 = &S;\n    s(&S2);\n}\n```\n",

I think this relates to the discussion about `'_`, and [this comment of mine](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1177#issuecomment-124283746) in particular. Basically I agree with @eefriedman that technically there is no bug here -- rather, a bug was fixed. _However,_ the behavior doesn't seem right nonetheless, for the reasons I argued on the thread. It seems to me that trait object lifetimes, which follow distinct defaulting rules, should not affect elision in quite the way they currently do.\n",

    "body": "OK, as I thought, the elision determination is made based on the `Ty<'tcx>`, which has no information about whether the object lifetime was derived from a default or not. So this would be mildly tricky to implement. Basically, we would want to walk the AST instead of the type, I think. Of course we're already doing this walk when we convert, so it might be nice if we could gather the information that we need as we do it. I'll have to think about it. But it IS an interesting question as to precisely what rules we want here that we ought to settle first.\n\nI think that approaching this basic on the _position_ where the lifetime appears is probably best. However, one might also approach by making special treatment for `'static` (after all, the object lifetime defaulting rules will either pick `'static`  or they will pick the lifetime of an enclosing `&` or some lifetime parameter placed on the trait, so if we behave differently around `'static` that would also cover this case). For example, one might expect this to compile:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo<'s> { x: &'s i32 }\nfn foo(x: &Foo<'static>) -> &Foo<'static> { x }\nfn main() { }\n```\n\nBut it does not today, since there are two lifetimes (in principle) one might choose in the return type: the anonymous one, or `'static`. If we made the rules treat `'static` as \"non-conflicting\" -- i.e., only pick `'static` if there is nothing else to pick, it would address this case, but perhaps that is bit too creepy.\n\n(Mostly just thinking through the possibilities here, not endorsing a plan of action.)\n",

    "body": "If we want to change this, it probably requires an RFC. The rules as they are today are somewhat confusing, which is somewhat inevitable with the invisible trait lifetime bounds.\n\nThe new rules means that code like\n\n``` Rust\nfn foo(t: Box<Trait>) -> &u8\n```\n\nwill compile with the interpretation `fn(Box<Trait+'static>) -> &'static u8`\n\nBecause duplicate lifetimes are ignored, this code can only cause an issue if either the user explicitly specifies an object lifetime bound (e.g. `fn foo<'a>(a: Box<Trait+'a>, b: &u8) -> &u8`), which I feel OK with breaking, or an object lifetime gets forced to `'static`.\n\nMy preferred solution is to prevent elision to `'static`, probably after a warning cycle with soft elision. Functions like `fn foo(x: &'static u8) -> &u8` (fine under old and current, will break) itself feel confusing.\n",
