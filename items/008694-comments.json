    "body": "This is working as intended. Changing a static is like changing a `#define` in a header file. C/C++ don't magically recompile object files, you have to explicitly lay out dependencies.\n\nThis would fall under the purview of a project like rustpkg, but there is currently no form of dependency management between crates.\n\nDue to working as intended, I'm closing this issue. It's well understood that dependency management is not ideal today, but I don't think that this is the right issue to track that in.\n",
