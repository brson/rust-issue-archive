    "body": "This is actually a general problem in that when a task fails it will forcibly log the error to the task's logger. With #9967 coming down the pipe soon, I believe that the way forward with this is to have the message get propagated to the parent who then decides what to do with it.\n\nFor rustc specifically, all of the monitored tasks wouldn't print their failure, the parents would receive the failure and then just ignore it (or print the ICE message).\n",
