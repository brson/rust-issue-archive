    "body": "This is working as indented. `use std::i64::MAX;` imports `MAX` symbol into `hello`. However, in the function `the_big_number`, `std::i64::MAX` is relative path so it means it tries to find `std` in `hello`.\n\nFix:\n1. `pub fn the_big_number() -> i64 { MAX }` (since `MAX` is in the scope of `hello`)\n2. `pub fn the_big_number() -> i64 { ::std::i64::MAX }` (use absolute path)\n\nThat said, I've always thought this mistake is common and there should be a hint about this. (A-diagnostics label)\n",
