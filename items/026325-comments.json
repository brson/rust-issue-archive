    "body": "@Aatch I didn't think to specifically test whether it was the added information in the `where` clause or the function that made it slower, but that makes sense.\n\nThe big question to me is why does the function having output type `Self::Output` cause the compiler to be confused and require the statement in the `where` clause?\n\nIn the `AddPeano` example, we still do `Succ<<Lhs as AddPeano<Rhs>>::Output>`, so `<Lhs as AddPeano<Rhs>>::Output` must still `impl Peano`, but the compiler is able to infer that it does.\n\nSimilarly, [here](http://is.gd/llppVT) is another example that I've just stumbled across:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Marker {}\nstruct Bob;\nimpl Marker for Bob {}\n\ntrait DoNothing {\n    type Output;\n}\nimpl DoNothing for Bob {\n    type Output = Bob;\n}\nstruct Dude<M: Marker>(M);\n\n// Conflicting implementation with this line uncommented,\n// Marker not implemented for <Bob as DoNothing>::Output error with it commented\nimpl Marker for <Bob as DoNothing>::Output {}\n\nconst b: Dude<<Bob as DoNothing>::Output> = Dude(Bob);\n\nfn main() {\n}\n```\n\nThe compiler is able to check that `<Bob as DoNothing>::Output` implements `Marker`, but it is seemingly unable to infer it. \n",
