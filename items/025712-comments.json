    "body": "For online experimentation, there is the playpen: https://play.rust-lang.org/\n\nYou can also send expressions to the `playbot` on the `#rust` IRC channel.\n\nWe used to have an experimental command line REPL, `rusti`, but it was brittle and not maintained well, so it was eventually retired.  See PR #9897\n\nThere may be future attempts to make a rust repl atop other components provided here, but I do not know if such a tool will ever again be part of the rust project itself.  In any case, such a tool certainly seems like it would need to first go through the RFC process:\n\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#when-you-need-to-follow-this-process\n",
