    "body": "With respect to the second question of whether we should make a more explicit notion of marker trait, I have been pondering this since the RFC discussion. On the one hand, there are a number of places in Rust today where going from nothing to something is a breaking change: adding a private field to a struct, for example. \n\nThe difference here I think is that:\n1. Given the ability to specify defaults, adding an item to a trait does not necessarily have to be a breaking change otherwise (though methods and fns can cause new ambiguities etc).\n2. If there are impls that are taking advantage of the ability to overlap, there may just be no way to port older code forward, because it would require overlap.\n\nHowever, the second point depends a lot on the fate of specialization. If we wind up adopting specialization, and in particular a model that does not require strict subsets, then it would still be possible to adapt existing impls. This makes me a lot less worried. Of course, implementing that form of specialization is tricky, but not (I don't think...) that much trickier than implementing THIS suggestion. The hard part in both cases is the potential for overlap.\n",

    "body": "So is the current status that we have both `#[feature(overlapping_marker_traits)]` which applies to any trait with no items, and `#[marker]`?\r\n\r\nBased on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29864#issuecomment-409398581, it seems like consensus is that `overlapping_marker_traits` shouldn't happen without opt-in from the trait, and indeed with https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project/pull/18 we now have a concrete example for code that would be unsound if overlapping impls were allowed for `Unpin`. Is that correct? Does that mean we could remove the code that can permit any item-less trait to have overlapping impls?",

I think a first step would be to do a bit of \"archival research\", documenting the history and current design (which is now using e.g. a `#[marker]` attribute) and looking for any unresolved questions. We've not done a very good job of tracking that on this issue, it seems, though I just made a few edits to the main header.\r\n\r\nOne thing I just remembered is that https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68004 we were discussing some interaction between marker traits and negative impls (see [this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68004#issuecomment-575760294) for more details). In particular there was a sort of unresolved question (I can't find the issue just now) that was asking whether marker traits should be exempt from the orphan rules (i.e., I should be able to implement a marker trait for any type, not only my own types).\r\n\r\nI think the answer to this is probably **no** -- or at least I would not feel comfortable stabilizing those orphan rule extensions until we talk more about negative reasoning.",

    "body": "> In particular there was a sort of unresolved question (I can't find the issue just now) that was asking whether marker traits should be exempt from the orphan rules (i.e., I should be able to implement a marker trait for any type, not only my own types).\r\n\r\n> I think the answer to this is probably no -- or at least I would not feel comfortable stabilizing those orphan rule extensions until we talk more about negative reasoning.\r\n\r\nI agree - I think any kind of 'orphan rule exemption' for `#[marker]` should require an explicit opt-in.\r\n\r\nImagine you have a 'safe marker trait', like `std::cmp::Eq`. If you're willing to commit to having it always have no associated items, it might make sense to make it `#[marker]`. However, disabling the orphan rules would allow downstream crates to break a (safe) API contract. For example (in a world where `std::cmp::eq` is `#[marker]`):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// crate1\r\nstruct NotReflexive;\r\nimpl std::cmp::PartialEq for NotReflexive {\r\n    fn eq(&self, _other_: &Self) -> bool { false }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// crate 2\r\nimpl std::cmp::Eq for crate1::NotReflexive {} // uh oh\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we've violated the (safe) API contract for `std::cmp::Eq`, and there's nothing that `crate1` can do to prevent this. While this can't lead to unsoundness, I think it's a good idea to be able to prevent this kind of code from compiling (via the orphan rule).",

    "body": "I've tried to collect the known open questions and issues here. \r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n- [Bike-shedding the name](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/53693#issuecomment-416583563). Does this require an RFC? @nikomatsakis thoughts on this?\r\n- Is there [any unsoundness around Unpin](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29864#issuecomment-515780867) now that you are required to explicitly opt into marker traits with `#[marker]`? I haven't able to completely follow this topic yet, but it seems that @RalfJung was able to convince himself that there is [no unsoundness](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project/pull/18#issuecomment-515780620) although his [latest comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29864#issuecomment-645829361) does not indicate as such. I _believe_ however that this concern along with [others](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29864#issuecomment-645778402) are resolved by the fact that the mechanism is now opt-in.\r\n- How does this interact with [negative trait impls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68004#issuecomment-575304212)? The discussion of this seemed to have good [ideas](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68004#issuecomment-575760294) on how to handle this, but was consensus reached? This is tied to how `#[marker]` traits interact with the orphan rule. Currently `#[marker]` traits fully respect the orphan rule. \r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\n- Does the implementation [work cross crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29864#issuecomment-295907958)? I'm not fully sure what this means. This might be a left over from before `#[marker]` explicit opt-in was introduced. \r\n- The [order of impl declarations matter](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29864#issuecomment-367164860).\r\n\r\nI think most of these should be answered before we move forward with stabilization.

It might actually be possible to change all auto traits to marker traits again, only requiring opt-in for non-auto traits, as for those, adding an item to the trait definition would otherwise be a breaking change.\r\n\r\n*edit: nm, the idea is for a macro to add `impl<T: NotImplemented> Unpin for NotUnpin<T>` to prevent the type from implementing `Unpin`. This would not work anymore if `Unpin` was a marker trait. While I don't necessarily think that this pattern is the best solution and am hoping for the stabilization of negative impls for this instead, it is definitely a reason to keep marker traits as opt in.*\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I have an action item to leave a comment here but I can't find the notes. In any case, my vague recollection is that:\r\n\r\nDespite marker traits permitting one to stretch the coherence rules, they are specifically targeting the *overlap* rules and not the *orphan* rules (i.e., they don't let you write impls in crates that you wouldn't have been permitted to write an impl in). If we ensure that marker traits follow the same orphan rules as everyone else, I don't think they pose any particular problem for the negative reasoning that we do elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere was also a (related) interaction between marker traits and negative impls that was [discussed here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68004#issuecomment-575304212). In short, the problem was that if we lifted the orphan rules for marker traits, then one could add an explicit `!Marker` impl in a crate and an `Marker` impl in another crate. [As I noted then](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68004#issuecomment-575760294), the way I think about it is that, after a trait is published, only one crate ever has the right to add any particular impl (positive or negative). Specifically, if an impl applies to a type X, only the crate in which X is declared has the right to add that impl. This fits with the fact that adding blanket impls (which could apply to such types) is a semver-breaking change after a trait is released. This same idea applies to negative impls too: you can only add a negative impl if you would've been the one to add the positive impl.\r\n\r\nThe case that @RalfJung is talking about seems to be the same, but the \"negative reasoning\" in question is implicit due to the fact that everything is within the same crate.

This is useful in the presence of runtime-dynamic matrix dimensions, indicated by the `Dyn` type \u2013 those require a runtime check in addition to the `DimEq` bound.\r\n```rust\r\n#[marker]\r\ntrait DimEq {}\r\nimpl<const D: usize> DimEq for (Const<D>, Const<D>) {} // guaranteed to be equal\r\nimpl<const D: usize> DimEq for (Dyn, Const<D>) {}  // *can* be equal (ensured by runtime assertion)\r\nimpl DimEq for (Dyn, Dyn) {}  // *can* be equal (ensured by runtime assertion)\r\nimpl<T, U> DimEq for (T, U) where (U, T): DimEq {} // order shouldn't matter when using this\r\n// (important in generic code calling other generic code, otherwise they have to require both or agree on order)\r\n\r\n// Notably, this isn't implemented for `(Const<A>, Const<B>)` when A and B are different.\r\n// catches mistakes at compiletime instead of runtime when possible!\r\n```",
