    "body": "@kballard I'll address your questions in reverse order.  :)\n\n> -2. Does this affect runtime performance?\n\nIt might. But only because it hasn't been quite as tightly optimized as it should be.\n\nI was thinking of the particular case of C-like enums on the way home today.\n\nThose cases are covered by this (not yet implemented) optimization: I _really_ should be letting comparisons of two enums that both have no subparts (e.g. `B` and `D` in `enum E { A(int), B, C(f64), D }` fall through the catch-all as well, since the catch-all will have all of the information it needs to give the answers in such cases.\n\nOnce such an optimization is in place, then for C-like enums all of the cases would just fall through to the catch-all (i.e. there would be no preceding arms).\n\n---\n\nThe other piece of the story there would be speeding up the mapping from the value to its discriminant index.  Currently I am just emitting that code in place as another match statement, but in principle that could (and should?) be replaced by a compiler intrinsic, as discussed here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15375#issuecomment-47994344\n\n---\n\nAnyway, I haven't done any benchmarking yet of the generated code.  I will try to whip some up in parallel with the rest of the review.\n\nAs for the compile times and code size measures, I _have_ informally benchmarked that; I'll post those results in a follow-up comment.\n",

    "body": "@kballard okay here is a gist with some semi-formal benchmark results.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/3dcc567222d0906f1c42\n\nThe gist has both the program I used to generate the test data and the benchmarking driver script, but the important thing are the two \"files\" at the bottom, which are transcripts comparing my stage0 rustc behavior with my stage1 rustc behavior.\n\nThe main points to note are:\n- Regarding expanded code size (which is one thing that affects overall compile times): [stage0 on line 28](https://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/3dcc567222d0906f1c42#file-stage0-results-L28) shows that for an enum with 150 variants, the generated source code size is 2.6 megabytes.  Compare that with [stage1 on line 28](https://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/3dcc567222d0906f1c42#file-stage1-results-L28), where the same 150 variant enum has a generated source code size of 148K.\n- Regarding compile times themselves, [stage0 on line 55](https://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/3dcc567222d0906f1c42#file-stage0-results-L55) shows that for that enum of 150 variants, compiling to object code took 11 seconds.  The analogous result for [stage1 on line 55](https://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/3dcc567222d0906f1c42#file-stage1-results-L55) is 0.55 seconds.\n\nSince we're talking about quadratic code size generation here, the problem note above only gets worse and worse as the number of variants in the enum grows.  E.g for a 200 variant enum, the stage0 expanded code size I observe for this generator program is 4.6M, versus 200K for stage1.\n\n(There is also a difference in the code size of the final output binary, which you can see at the gist as well, but I think the number of enum variants has to grow quite large, e.g. > 200 variants, before those get so drastically bad as what I'm reporting above for the expanded code size, presumably because much of the time that we are spending in compilation is LLVM getting the generated code back into something semi-reasonable.  Still, the generated code for the new deriving is smaller when the number of variants is large, and I believe with the optimizations I outlined in my previous comment, it should compete favorably with our current deriving system even for enums with small numbers of variants.) \n",

    "body": ">  That is, there might be a client out there with an example of hypothetical deriving mode that wants to opt into the O(N^K) behavior\n\nThinking about it now, I don't think any generic `deriving`-like mode can do _anything_ meaningful with the contained data when the variants don't match: there's rarely a non-trivial relationship between the fields e.g. types will only match by chance/in rare cases. So I'm 100% happy with the old code disappearing, the new code is so much nicer. (Far less O(N^K) recursion, while retaining the entirety of the generally useful information. :heart:)\n",
