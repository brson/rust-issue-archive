Both collections\nare also currently missing some of the tooling specific to sorted collections, which\nis planned as future work pending reform of these APIs. General implementation issues\nare discussed with TODOs internally\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nStill waiting on compilation/test/bench stuff locally, but the edit-distance on any errors should be very small at this point. This is ready to be reviewed.\n",
