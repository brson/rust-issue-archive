  "body": "See https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/16 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15701\n- Added syntax support for attributes on expressions and all syntax nodes in statement position.\n- Extended `#[cfg]` folder to allow removal of statements, and\n  of expressions in optional positions like expression lists and trailing\n  block expressions.\n- Extended lint checker to recognize lint levels on expressions and\n  locals.\n- As per RFC, attributes are not yet accepted on `if` expressions.\n\nExamples:\n\n``` rust\n#[cfg(unset)]\nlet x = y;\n#[cfg(unset)]\n{\n        ...\n}\nassert_eq!((1, #[cfg(unset)] 2, 3), (1, 3));\n\n#[allow(non_snake_case_name)]\nlet FOO = 0;\n```\n\nImplementation wise, there are a few rough corners and open questions:\n- The parser work ended up a bit ugly.\n- The pretty printer change was based mostly on guessing.\n- Similar to the `if` case, there are some places in the grammar where a new `Expr` node starts,\n  but where it seemed weird to accept attributes and hence the parser doesn't. This includes:\n  - const expressions in patterns\n  - in the middle of an postfix operator chain (that is, after `.`, before indexing, before calls)\n  - on range expressions, since `#[attr] x .. y` parses as  `(#[attr] x) .. y`, which is inconsistent with\n    `#[attr] .. y` which would parse as `#[attr] (.. y)`\n- Attributes are added as additional `Option<Box<Vec<Attribute>>>` fields in expressions and locals.\n- Memory impact has not been measured yet.\n- A cfg-away trailing expression in a block does not currently promote the previous `StmtExpr` in a block to a new trailing expr. That is to say, this won't work:\n\n``` rust\nlet x = {\n    #[cfg(foo)]\n    Foo { data: x }\n    #[cfg(not(foo))]\n    Foo { data: y }\n};\n```\n- One-element tuples can have their inner expression removed to become Unit, but just Parenthesis can't. Eg, `(#[cfg(unset)] x,) == ()` but `(#[cfg(unset)] x) == error`. This seemed reasonable to me since tuples and unit are type constructors, but could probably be argued either way.\n- Attributes on macro nodes are currently unconditionally dropped during macro expansion, which seemed fine since macro disappear at that point?\n- Attributes on `ast::ExprParens` will be prepend-ed to the inner expression in the hir folder.\n- The work on pretty printer tests for this did trigger, but not fix errors regarding macros:\n  - expression `foo![]` prints as `foo!()` \n  - expression `foo!{}` prints as `foo!()` \n  - statement `foo![];` prints as `foo!();` \n  - statement `foo!{};` prints as `foo!();` \n  - statement `foo!{}` triggers a `None` unwrap ICE.\n",
