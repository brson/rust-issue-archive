    "body": "This may not be so much of a bug with dynamic dispatch, but rather with how `std::io` is designed. Inside of that module, you'll find:\n\n```\nimpl Reader for @Reader { ... }\nimpl<T: Reader> ReaderUtil for T { ... }\n```\n\nI think what's happening here is that there's no impl of `Reader` for `&Reader` (which is a bit odd), so that's why `@Reader` is explicitly working. There's a few things to note about this though:\n1. `std::io` is going to be removed soon\n2. `ReaderUtil` should probably be implemented as default methods (now that they work) instead of a helper trait.\n3. The method lookup should probably actually work in this case.\n\nAs an example, I think that this code should compile:\n\n``` rust\ntrait A {}\ntrait B { fn foo(&self); }\n\nimpl<T: A> B for T {\n    fn foo(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn foo(a: &A) {\n    a.foo();\n}\n\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nBasically, if you ignore all the ways in which I think `std::io` should change, I think that this small code sample should compile regardless.\n",

    "body": "As @alexcrichton said, this is a bug with `io` (which is a known problem). Regarding the later example he gave, that snippet does not compile and should not compile because the object type `&A` does not automatically implement the trait `A`. The reason for this is that, to implement a trait, a type must implement ALL of the trait methods, but some traits have methods that are not usable with various object types (as a simple example, consider an `@self` method -- how could you invoke that on an `&A` object?). Closing since there is no bug to be fixed except for io, and work there is in progress.\n",
