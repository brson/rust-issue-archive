The only case where it's truly _painful_ to write an external iterator is a recursive traversal where you have to build a stack of the state you hoisted out.\n\nContext switches for each iteration aren't acceptable so the solutions used by Ruby (`to_enum`) and Python (generators) aren't a good model. C#'s state machine generator is a killer feature, but would likely take a lot of effort to implement correctly.\n",

    "body": "I thought a bit about this today. One problem with providing `yield` syntax is that while it makes writing `Iterator` impls easy to write...\n\n``` rust\nyield fn zero2ten() -> struct Zero2TenIter {\n    let mut x = 0;\n    while x <= 10 {\n        yield x;\n        x += 1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n...`DoubleEndedIterator` impls nevertheless still require defining a `struct` and writing `next()` and `next_back()` manually:\n\n``` rust\nfn zero2ten() -> Zero2TenIter { Zero2TenIter { start: 0, end: 10 } }\nstruct Zero2TenIter { start: uint, end: uint }\nimpl Iterator<uint> for Zero2TenIter {\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<uint> {\n        if self.start <= self.end {\n            let v = self.start;\n            self.start += 1;\n            Some(v)\n        } else {\n            None\n        }\n    }\n}\nimpl DoubleEndedIterator<uint> for Zero2TenIter {\n    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<uint> {\n        if self.start <= self.end {\n            let v = self.end;\n            self.end -= 1;\n            Some(v)\n        } else {\n            None\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the problem with that is that now upgrading a existing `yield` function to a `DoubleEndedIterator` becomes even more work than if it started as a regular `struct`+`impl` to begin with, which means users will be less likely to do that, and just live with one-ended ones even if double-ended ones would make perfect sense and potentially improve re usability of the iterator. \n\nSo, as a solution, how about just making the `yield` syntax optionally a bit more complicated, with the ability to write both `Iterator` and `DoubleEndedIterator` impls more easily than in the manual \"constructor fn + struct + trait impls\" way: \n\n``` rust\nyield fn zero2ten() -> struct Zero2TenIter {\n    let mut start = 0;\n    let mut end   = 10;\n} front {\n    while start <= end {\n        yield start;\n        start += 1;\n    }\n} back {\n    while start <= end {\n        yield end;\n        end -= 1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe idea here is to give the user three code blocks to fill out: initialization, which contains all the setup code for the iterator and any variable declarations that are shared state for both Iterator impls, and two code blocks corresponding to the two iterator impls. A user of this syntax would still have to take care of checking that both code blocks play nice together and properly recognize that the ranges meet in the middle, but they could do so more easily than in the manual implementation way.\n",

    "body": "Hm, that might work too, but I'm not sure if all forward/reverse Iterators follow the same kind of control flow, that would need to be investigated. Provided they do though, I'd imagine a syntax like this: \n\n``` rust\nyield fn slice_iter<'a, T>(slice: &'a [T]) -> struct SliceIter<'a, T> for &'a T {\n    let mut start = 0;\n    let mut end = slice.len();\n    while start < end {\n        yield in {\n            [>..] => { let x = &slice[start]; start += 1; x }\n            [..<] => { let x = &slice[end-1];   end -= 1; x }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThat is, provide fork points in the control flow where iterating from the front vs from the back should cause different state changes. \n\nI also on purpose picked exotic syntax instead of using something simpler like boolean values: While discussing the topic of double ended iterators, people repeatedly confuse how `next_back()` is supposed to work, so it seems worthwhile to me to have a little syntactic reminder: A double ended Iterator represents a range of values where elements can be picked from the front (`[>..]`) or from the back (`[..<]`).\n\nA `yield fn` without `yield in` blocks could then simply be inferred to just be a simple one-ended `Iterator` impl\n",

In fact, it would be rather correct to say that Protothreads had been invented to ease coding of complex state machines in C. Thereby, in theory, if one defines a few simple macros that generate a single-threaded state machine code in rust, that would a good enough replacement. Although, the task of implementing such macros would be eased if `yield` keyword existed. (Thanks to @olgierdh for some input on this). \n",
