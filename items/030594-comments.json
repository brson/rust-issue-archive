The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @brson (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

The answer is extension traits, possibly in the prelude.\n\nFor `str` and `char` we\u2019ve done this \"backwards\": libcore has `StrExt` and `CharExt` traits in its prelude with a subset of the functionality, while inherent method definitions are in libcollections and librustc_unicode.

We did it for primitive types primarily because you hit them so early when learning Rust that extension traits seemed really problematic.\n\nI agree with @huonw that ideally we'd have it unstable in `core` and stable in `std`, so that we can take our time on the stabilization aspect. @SimonSapin, would you mind trying that?\n",
