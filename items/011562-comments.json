    "body": "@brson: In my opinion, Rust should be offering the logo and/or other artwork under a permissive license. Mozilla's rationale for not using a free license for the Firefox branding (the name _and_ logo) seems to be avoiding confusion for users. Rust's users are developers and can be expected to have a basic understanding about forks and patches applied by their distribution. I don't think it would be good if Debian was shipping Rust another a different package name as they do for Firefox.\n\nI expect more artwork/logos will be created by the community, and Mozilla won't have control over these anyway. Rust probably won't ever ship with a UI, so the logo won't ever be a prominent part of the software itself like it is for Firefox.\n",

As far as I can tell, there is no trademark for Rust the language.\n\nI'm a self-employed software developer/freelancer/consultant and I'd like to offer Rust programming as an additional service soonish. I've registered rust-services.de and rust-services.eu for that purpose.\n\nThere is already at least one precedent for services with \"Rust\" in the domain name (http://rust-ci.org/) and a lot a of examples for using \"Rust\" as part of a project name, but I know of no examples of commercial services doing this.\n\nWhat is the position of the Rust team and Mozilla on this?\n",

    "body": "+1 for a documented name and logo usage policy. For example - if I wanted to create a logo for a Rust user group, can it be derived from, say, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/blob/gh-pages/logos/rust-logo-blk.svg? As @brson mentions it's CC-BY so I guess it's ok as long as I state that the original logo comes from the Rust project. However a page similar to [Python Software Foundation trademark usage policy](https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/) would be great in making that clear in such cases.\n",

    "body": "Hi all, I represent www.unixstickers.com which already manufactures stickers with the most popular logos and designs. All the designs we use are licensed and we already have deals with most of the unix/sw/opensource projects. We have a lot of request for Rust stickers and we actually have the Rust stickers launch scheduled for this Thursday since from this topic \u2013  when we checked \u2013 commercial use seemed to be allowed. Our stickers will use the original logo without modifications. Can you confirm this to be legit? Can anyone get in touch (andrea@unixstickers.com) to understand how we could collaborate? Also let us know if we should have the modified sticker removed from Sticker Mule, as our team works closely with Sticker Mule and we're 100% available to do anything necessary to respect your rights : )\n",

    "body": "Cross-posted from [discuss](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rust-trademark-policy/2592). Sorry for the long wait on this!\n\n# \n\nThe core team has been working for some time to hammer out a policy for Rust's trademarks -- which are distinct from the _copyright_ policy surrounding the code and logos. In particular, while copyright governs how an artifact can be copied and modified, trademark talks about ways that a particular \"brand\" can be applied. (Look [here](http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/view/11/38) if you want a long read about open source and trademarks.)\n\nYou can read our policy [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/legal.html).\n\n> Note, the website's new invalidation system may mean you see a stale, misformatted copy of this page. Hopefully the final version will hit all of the caches soon! You can also read directly at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/blob/master/legal.md\n\nThe basic news here is that we are adopting a pretty liberal stance around Rust's trademarks, allowing our logos and names to be applied, even in modified form, in many contexts -- so long as the use does not imply official endorsement by or affiliation with the Rust project. (Commercial uses need to check in so we can confirm this is the case, before money is ever involved.)\n\nThat's the TL;DR, but please read the full policy to understand the role that trademark plays, and the nuances of our approach.\n\n# \n\nI'm going to close this issue, because we're now officially providing the logos from the site, as well as the various legal policies surrounding them. However, I'm glad to keep the discussion going about these policies, both here, on discuss, or via email.\n",
