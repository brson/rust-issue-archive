The basic idea is that you can say that `Trait<A,B,Output=C>: Reflect` if `A`, `B`, and `C` all implement `Reflect`. This is a bit specific to reflect in that it assumes that any concrete types which appear in the trait interface already implement `Refect` (since all concrete types implement reflect, after all).\n",

    "body": "Oh, yay! I didn't think there was still hope for improving this. :)\n\nJust to be explicit about it, the solution I had been envisioning was that we would have something like:\n\n```\ntrait Reflect { const TYPE_ID: TypeId; ... }\n```\n\nand for every type that is declared, an `impl` _for that particular type_ would automatically be derived:\n\n```\n// you write\nstruct Foo { ... }\n// compiler writes\nimpl Reflect for Foo { ... }\n\n// you write\nstruct Bar<T> { ... }\n// compiler writes\nimpl<T: Reflect> Reflect for Foo<T> { ... }\n\n// you write\nstruct Baz<'a, T> { ... }\n// compiler writes\nimpl<T: Reflect> Reflect for Baz<'static, T> { ... }\n```\n\nand so on. (This gets hairier with HKTs, because then you need either `Reflect` to be polykinded or an infinite family of `Reflect` traits at each kind to be able to (auto-)write `impl`s for types with higher-kinded type parameters, but we can cross that bridge when we come to it.)\n\nThree inter-connected thoughts I don't know how to paragraphise together:\n- Above I have `TYPE_ID` as a member of `Reflect`, but whether it's done that way or if the compiler \"natively\" knows type IDs for each type, and `Reflect` is only used as a way to regulate access to that functionality (as I believe is done in this PR), seems like basically an implementation detail.\n- Instead of auto-deriving as above, explicit `#[derive(Reflect)]` could also be required, like GHC used to do with `Typeable`, but apart from concerns like code size (for run-time type information) I can't imagine any reason you _wouldn't_ want to have a given type to have an `impl` (which is why GHC is going to auto-derive as of 7.10).\n- Ability to reason about code (parametricity) is the biggest reason to want this, but another, more down-to-earth reason might be that if we ever want to extend \"don't pay for what you don't use\" to RTTI, then having `impl<T> Any for T` seems like it would prevent us from doing that. (Or at least, my assumption is that Rust currently emits type IDs into the generated code for every declared type, but maybe this is mistaken?)\n\nIn connection to the above points GHC's [new `Typeable` implementation](https://git.haskell.org/ghc.git/commitdiff/b359c886cd7578ed083bcedcea05d315ecaeeb54) might also be of interest.\n\nAll of that throat-clearing out of the way: I'm not really familiar with OIBIT so I'm not sure to what extent it matches up with the above, but I suspect that it probably does.\n\nWith respect to traits, just to make sure I'm understanding correctly, the idea is that given a non-trait type viewed as a trait object, `let foo: &Display = &123: &u32`, you _wouldn't_ be able to reflect into `foo` and discover that it is in fact a `u32`, and for that, you would need to use `&(Display+Reflect)` or `&(Display+Any)`? And meanwhile, given `bar: &Any = foo: &Display`, we _do_ want to be able to discover that `bar` is in fact a `Display` trait object? (So in Haskell, this corresponds to something like (using `ExistentialQuantification` and `ConstraintKinds`) `data TraitObject (trait :: * -> Constraint) = forall ty. trait ty => TraitObject ty`, where we have `instance Typeable trait => Typeable (TraitObject trait)`, with `Typeable`, at kind _`Constraint`_, being required for the trait (`class`) that's used as a parameter in order for `TraitObject trait` itself to be `Typeable`.)\n\nIf that's the case, then I still have to think harder about it to be sure :), but the proposed rules feel like they probably have the right idea.\n",

    "body": "I also significantly revised the design of the trait. The Reflect trait is now basically a marker trait you can use to tag other reflection mechanisms, but not interesting to users on its own. Even better, it can be marked unstable. This means that functions that wish to use reflections over generic types should bound those types with `Any`, not `Reflect`.\n\nThe reason for this change (among other things):\n1. The old design requires `Reflect: 'static`, which was stronger than other reflection mechanisms need, and also too strong for `Any`. In particular, `Fn(&int)` failed because that would in turn require `for<'a> &'a int: 'static` (because `Reflect` requires that all _types_ reachable impl Reflect, unlike the normal intepretation).\n2. This means that `trait Any: Reflect+'static` contains the full requirements for TypeId etc. The use of `Reflect` is there just to ensure that the blanket impl for Any is not \"overeager\".\n3. It seems to just read nicer in general -- fewer traits to be concerned with.\n",
