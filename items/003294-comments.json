    "body": "Thanks for the analysis and description of how Entity handles strings.\n\nString efficiency has long been a problem in Rust because they have been unique types, `~str`. Unique things tend to get copied often, but are safe to send between tasks. Rust now has a garbage collected (actually reference counted) string type called `@str` that should behave more like you expect, but the libraries haven't caught up to the language, so `@str` is rarely used.\n\nI suggest that the fix for this problem is to modify `core::str` to support `@str` in more places. In particular, none of the functions that create new strings can yet create `@str`. @nikomatsakis has some ideas for how to improve core here.\n\nAtomic reference counting in strings doesn't fit so well with Rust's memory model, and shouldn't be needed.\n",
