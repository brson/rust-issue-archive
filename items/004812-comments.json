    "body": "Ok, so I've got a tentative list of c++ functions that I need to rewrite in rust to resolve this issue. I just want to make sure I've got my approach worked out correctly:\n- the c++ in `src/rt` that uses `kernel->malloc()` need to be rewritten in rust within `core`.\n- Within those codefiles in `core`, we will be using the `private::exchange_alloc` functions where we would use `kernel->malloc()` previously, otherwise keep the logic the same.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nNOTE: this implies moving std::uv_ll into core (`rust_uv.cpp` does some mallocs). Or should core export an API to do direct mallocs/frees to the exchange heap?\n",
