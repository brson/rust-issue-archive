    "body": "Hmm, OK. So the code _does_ attempt to handle this, but I don't know if it is handled in the right way. Specifically, it creates fresh region variables for each region and checks to see whether they unify. The trouble is that `Foo<'a,'b>` _does_ unify with `Foo<'b,'a>`\u2014it unifies if and only if `'a` and `'b` are the same region. But this is precisely what @nikomatsakis claimed to be a problem in #14022. So I'm not sure what the right thing is to do here.\n",
