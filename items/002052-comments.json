    "body": "This doesn't directly address your issue but most types have standard comparison functions defined, like `uint::le`. There's an additional problem with them though, that they are usually defined with by-value parameters, but generic functions expect by-ref parameters. We could also define something like `core::univ` that defines all the universal operators over generic types, like eq, ne, lt, gt, le, ge.\n",
