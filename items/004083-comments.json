    "body": "Added two comments for things that ought to be fixed.  Probably the borrowck code ought to be fixed first.  Fixing the parsing of `for x.each` would be good but could conceivably be done in a separate patch.  It would also be nice to purge the old dual treatment for fields/methods, but it's fine to leave that for a later patch.\n",
