I am not sure if we are optimizing for the right case here.\n\nIn particular, I would expect we will have far more users that (1.) do not attempt to install multiple versions, and (2.) do not look at the Advanced options for their first experience with Rust.  And that leads me to think that we should optimize for the case where one would want the `PATH` modified by default.\n\nIs there some way that we could have this choice default to \"on\" by default, if one is using the default install directory?  Or is the target install directory an orthogonal choice in the installation process to whether one is on the \"Advanced\" versus \"non-Advanced\"\n",

    "body": "I have just installed Rust on Windows. I have many years of experience as a software engineer, but have not had the opportunity to write code in anger for a while. I thought Rust might be a good place to start again. Reading through the documentation I was advised to \"download the appropriate installer\" and that, after installation, running `$ rustc --version` would tell me the version number. It then goes on to say if the version is reported, \"Rust has been installed successfully!\" That implies, if the version isn't reported, Rust hasn't been installed successfully; that was my initial reaction.\n\nFirstly, I can't recall any tool that I have installed that can be called from the command line yet isn't in the path by default. Secondly, if not including the path is to remain the default behaviour, the documentation should be updated to indicate that is the case and how to use the \"Advanced\" dialog to change that. However, I agree with @pnkfelix, the default should be newbie friendly with the \"Advanced\" options being for those more in the know. \n\nI don't imagine many people would bother to go straight to GitHub and search for an existing issue. Some would google the problem, others post a question on a forum somewhere, others would flame Rust and yet others would just give up and go home. Surely you don't want to lose potential Rust users just to make life easier for power users installing multiple versions of Rust!\n",

Users have to either run it via shortcuts under StartMenu/Rust, or, add it to the PATH themselves.\n2. Have quick install add Rust to the PATH, but only if there are no other Rust installations on the machine.  This helps casual users, who only install Rust once, but I think this is more confusing for those installing multiple versions side-by-side.\n3. Remove the quick install button altogether.  Users will always have to go through the advanced sequence, but on the plus side, \"Add to PATH\" option becomes more discoverable.\n4. Other ideas?  (Please keep this reasonable.  Due to declarative nature of Windows Installer packages, implementation of complex rules gets really hairy really quickly).\n",
