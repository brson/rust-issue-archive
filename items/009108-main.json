  "body": "Fix uint overflow bugs in std::{at_vec, vec, str}\n\nCloses #8742\n\nFix issue #8742, which summarized is: unsafe code in vec and str did assume\nthat a reservation for `X + Y` elements always succeeded, and didn't overflow.\n\nIntroduce the method `Vec::reserve_additional(n)` to make it easy to check for\noverflow in `Vec::push` and `Vec::push_all`.\n\nIn std::str, simplify and remove a lot of the unsafe code and use `push_str`\ninstead. With improvements to `.push_str` and the new function\n`vec::bytes::push_bytes`, it looks like this change has either no or positive\nimpact on performance.\n\nI believe there are many places still where `v.reserve(A + B)` still can overflow.\nThis by itself is not an issue unless followed by (unsafe) code that steps aside\nboundary checks.\n",
