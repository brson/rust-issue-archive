My personal opinion was around the fact that many things were very tightly coupled to the scheduler/scheduler implementation, requiring anybody _not_ using the standard runtime to re-implement all the io code.\n\nThis should also leave room for stuff like de-virtualising the factory calls in the case of LTO (when we eventually get it), which is good for high-performance, constrained environments like game development.\n",

    "body": "Detached threads are not the normal pattern with OS threads and will make `valgrind` and `helgrind` unclean. If you use them, you have to put `pthread_exit(NULL)` at the bottom of `main` and the exit code will always be 0 if an `exit` function is not called directly. I'm convinced the best way to handle OS threads in Rust is to use RAII-based objects with `pthread_join` in the destructor and optionally a way to retrieve the thread's exit value.\n\nGood library support for 1:1 threading includes fast and easy to use static thread-local data as offered by C11, C++11 and D. This just isn't going to work with the current task-local data scheme. Memory-mapped I/O is also going to have to be avoided, despite it being the ideal way to do it in the 64-bit future.\n\n@Aatch: devirtualization won't really happen with or without LTO, LLVM isn't able to do it in most cases (it's likely not very important for this though)\n",

    "body": "tl;dr -- I want to agree with everyone! Your combined intelligence (and assumption of good faith) dwarfs my own. I think we can have 1:1 and M:N scheduling (or would like to pursue it as a noble goal, albeit possibly a-bridge-too-far) under one roof. I think we should try to get there with one abstraction and _not_ via stdlib forks (at this time I will invoke the ghost Tango/Phobos, as others have in numerous venues, myself included).\n\nKinda/sorta copy/pasted from some comments I made on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qj1hj/rustdev_the_future_of_mn_threading/) reddit post:\n\nI personally have never liked the magical/global nature of everything being in a task. I would be really interested in pursuing the idea of a `Runtime` as an RAII resource (this didn't really snap into focus until I read the above comment from @thestinger ) that just flat _does not exist_ when we enter `main()`, but it might be a bit too freaky for some people.\n\nIt would, amongst other things, require a heavy audit/refactor of `libstd` code for all stuff that relies on the `Runtime` in-the-large (something @alexcrichton alludes to in a comment on the above-linked issue).\n\nand FWIW: I'm talking about pushing lots of stuff that exists as langitems or similar (malloc, TLS, failure/unwinding, etc) into this `Runtime` trait so that we would be basically providing a swappable impl for any given platform scenario (embedded, async server, desktop app atop NSS, etc). I made a pitch for something like this, in the past, to @brson and I believe his response was that it was too drastic and not really neccesary (not trying to put words in his mouth, so I apologize if this characterization isn't correct). This idea undermines a lot of assumptions and decisions that were made a long time ago (and would appear to be out-of-reach for 1.0, lacking some serious all-hands-on-deck work).\n\nLikely, immediate critiques that I'd like to hear people arguing both sides of:\n- such a `Runtime` would be so broad, not taking into account the drastically different semantics different platform-scenarios present, as to be functionally useless or lopsided towards only a few specific scenarios. This is, from my reading, one of @thestinger 's beefs with the newsched IO traits.\n- mumble mumble traits! virtual calls! (also: LTO? THERE IS NO LTO!!!)\n",

    "body": "In my opinion, there are two core issues which need to be resolved to make progress on this issue, those are 10647 and 10459 (linked above). Once we have those out of the way, I believe that we're basically \"all the way there\" in terms of 1:1 scheduling. There will be lots of sharp edges to buff out, but those two issues are the core infrastructure for progressing forward. What they mean is that spawning/communication will work anywhere and everywhere, and there will always be a local task to rely on squirreling data into.\n\nWe may well turn up something else that I'm missing along the way, but those two issues are certainly a fantastic place to start progressing this issue forward.\n\nMy general idea of a \"runtime trait\" or having some sort of storage in the crate map I think is overthinking things too much. Right now I believe that `in_green_task_context()` is a good enough \"off the runtime\"/\"on the runtime\" check. We can abstract this even further later, but I don't think that we'll need to mature it much farther than the if statement.\n",

Choosing to support 1:1 and M:N does not mean that \"nothing will ever be fast\" because both methods need to be supported. I'm rewriting channels right now to seamlessly support 1:1 and M:N at runtime, and we're already 30% faster than go with little-to-no optimizations.\n\nChoosing whether to implement something for M:N and 1:1 may make an implementation more difficult, but it is not guaranteed to make an implementation much slower. Each implementation needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine how to optimize for both use cases. We cannot seamlessly port external concurrent libraries to rust because we have different design constraints as well as an emphasis on safety.\n",
