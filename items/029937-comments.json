Exception-safety is _largely_ about memory safety, and with this design 'panic safety' actually is only a tiny slice of exception-safety. It's very misleading - it actually doesn't have anything to do with panicking safely, but recovering safely.\n\nI'm not going to be the one to approve this.\n",

    "body": "@brson \n\nThe design is part of a long-going RFC process (including the lengthy thread for https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1236) which tackled the issue of what _safety_ covers in Rust (see e.g. [my comment there](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1236#issuecomment-136875613)). \n\nThis PR represents the consensus design balancing between those worried about panic safety problems as well as those primarily concerned with ergonomics. During the RFC process you raised concerns about introducing a new OIBIT, but these concerns were addressed by the RFC text and design at least to the level that the relevant teams made a consensus decision to land the feature experimentally, as in this PR.\n\nIt's vital that all team members abide by the consensus decisions we reached based on public discussion, even in cases where they personally disagree with the outcome. Consensus-based decision making is a fragile thing, and we all need to be operating openly and in good faith. Keep in mind that as always, there will be ample time to discuss this feature in the light of real-world experience on the [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27719) prior to stabilization.\n\nIf there is an immediately actionable tweak to the design -- such as the proposed renaming to `RecoverSafe` -- it's worth considering trying to land a tweaked version directly. The concerns you are raising here seem to be at least twofold -- the scope of \"safety\" in Rust and the \"narrowing\" of panic safety. The scoping issue I already mentioned (with relevant comment thread). The narrowing issue, I don't yet understand, but at this point discussion of the (de)merits of the feature in general (as opposed to minor design tweaks) should take place on the [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27719).\n",
