    "body": "The documentation now has colored bars indicating the stability status of a given API. There's more work to do though. Here's the issues I see:\n- The color bar doesn't tell you what it means when it annotates a function in a function list, like on the linked `StrAllocating` trait. It only gives the full \"deprecated\" title when the entire page is about a deprecated item (e.g. [`native::task::spawn`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/native/task/fn.spawn.html)).\n- There's no indication in the trait code listing at the top of the page about which items are deprecated, you have to look at the actual function documentation. It would be nice to add the `#[deprecated = \"...\"]` attributes into the code listing.\n- The deprecated display does not list the deprecation message. This last one I think is the most important.\n",

Now that it's accessible and being rendered within rustdoc, it should be easy to iterate on the design.\n\nThat said, it's nontrivial to balance discoverability with noisyness. Adding text like \"experimental\" for each item would add a lot of noise, now that `libstd` is almost entirely at `experimental` status. If someone has a design in mind for striking a good balance, I'd be happy to implement it (or help guide an implementation).\n",

    "body": "@aturon For the trait code listing at the top, we should definitely add `#[deprecated = \"..\"]` text, because deprecation is important to signal and should be relatively rare. Similarly, in function listings, I think we need a permanent message for deprecation (both to scream \"this is deprecated\" and to tell the user what the deprecation message is without any interaction).\n\nFor other stability attributes, I we can definitely omit them from the code listings, and then I think we can get away with just having mouseover behavior. When I mouse over the function listing, perhaps the stability name could show up right-aligned with some visual treatment.\n\nFWIW, I've advocated in the past for having similar mouseover behavior that exposes a `[src]` link for every single item. This could coexist with that by either putting the stability attribute to the left of the `[src]` link, or on a second line below it (if there's room; a function with no documentation may only occupy one line). But we don't currently have mouseover `[src]` links at all, so we can probably get away with ignoring that.\n",
