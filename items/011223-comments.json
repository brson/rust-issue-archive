    "body": "> reliable periodic timers (at least more so than continuously calling sleep())\n\nThat's why the native sleeping API is divided into `sleep_until(abstime)` and `sleep_for(reltime)`. POSIX condition variables are also based on an absolute time and a relative wait needs to be implemented based on that.\n\n``` rust\nlet mut abstime = monotonic();\nloop {\n    abstime.add_second(1);\n    abstime.sleep_until();\n    println(\"foo\")\n}\n```\n\n> selection over a timer channel and a large number of other channels\n\nIt would be more efficient to have a timeout parameter to `select` like the native versions. Anyway, `select` isn't necessarily a good abstraction for Rust's channels. Go uses it to inject non-determinism to make scheduling less unfair, but Rust has native threads available.\n\n> convenience with integration with the rest of our message passing runtime\n\nHaving all of these inter-dependencies makes the standard library less useful to someone who needs more than it offers. If you need multiple-producer/multiple-consumer channels, bounded channels or just different performance characteristics (contiguous memory) then you're sold out of luck.\n",
