    "body": "Sadly I've found this to not help whenever I've needed it to in the past. Frequently it's not just `libstdc++` that's \"too new\", but it's _also_ `libc` that's \"too new\". \n\nI _think_ that our snapshot builders have an old libc, but I don't actually know if they're linking against it. They may be picking up a libc that was installed with gcc 4.7 (a \"too new\" libc).\n\nAll-in-all, there'd be a few lingering questions for me:\n- This prevents dynamically loading any C++ code, is that desirable? This is largely relevant because we currently support dynamically opening syntax extensions. This would prevent anyone from adding optimization passes to LLVM I think, but that may not necessarily be the end of the world.\n- Does this actually fix the problem? The libc errors that I've seen after statically linking libstdc++ in the past worry me.\n\nI suspect the answer is \"yes, we should statically link libstdc++ for our distribution purposes.\" We may have to investigate the libc issue further, but this is a step forward!\n",
