    "body": "Both Michael and I have taken a look at this, and neither of us have found anything conclusive. Information dump:\n\n```\n* It might be a good idea to reset the debug location in debuginfo::create_function_debug_context() because trans::base::new_fn_ctxt_w_id() already creates some LLVM instructions which might be assigned some random, call-site source positions otherwise.\n* trans::base::alloca_maybe_zeroed() changes the position of the IR builder, possibly putting it back into the prelude section of the function. Clear source positions here also removed some unwanted source position assignments in IR.\n\nOther than that I have not found out why we still get different results than clang. The generated IR for a small test program looked very similar, but in the clang program the arguments already had the correct value in the first line of the function, while in the Rust program the correct values where loaded after the first line...\n\nMaybe some instruction appearing later in the IR gets assigned a wrong source position before at the beginning of the function body.\n```\n\nFrom my own investigations, I applied this patch (https://gist.github.com/jdm/7903912) and ended up generating very similar IR to clang for the programs at https://gist.github.com/jdm/7903924, but breaking on step::Foo::foopy still showed the same problem.\n",

    "body": "Here is what I tried and found so far:\n- Always set column numbers to zero. Both CLANG and GCC only provide line numbers for source positions.\n- Made sure that there are no superfluous allocas for immediate function arguments. There was some redundant copying around (in debug builds only) which I suspected to throw LLVM's function prelude detection off. This is just a simple modification of a condition in `trans::_match::store_arg()`.\n- CLANG creates a root lexical block for the function body (instead of using the subprogram DIE as the root scope). Function arguments are declared as siblings to this root block. I replicated this behaviour to see if it made a difference.\n- As already mentioned by Josh, I made sure that debug locations are reset before the function is translated and only turned on again after the arguments are loaded.\n- I checked whether the `more stack check` part of the function prelude causes the problem by applying the `#[no_split_stack]` attribute to test functions.\n\nUnfortunately, all of these measures combined still don't alleviate the problem. The LLVM IR looks right, the `dwarfdump` output looks right, but GDB and `objdump -S` still place the first statement _before_ the arguments are loaded `:/`\n\nLooks like this issue will pester us a while longer `:)`\n",

    "body": "OK, I think I know a bit more about the nature of this problem now:\nGDB does not seem to use the PROLOGUE END markers in the DWARF line information (GCC does not even generate them) Instead GDB seems to rely on some kind of prologue detection mechanism to find out where the body of a function starts. This seems to work most of the time for code generated by GCC, CLANG, and even RUSTC for functions with the `#[no_split_stack]` attribute.\n\nHowever, the additional machine code generated for checking whether more stack space needs to be allocated seems to throw off GDB's prologue detection and it thinks the regular part of the function has already begun there. So, my current guess is that Rust's dynamic stack allocation is what leads to this behaviour.\n\nNote that LLVM _does_ seem to generate correct PROLOGUE END markers in the DWARF line tables, even for functions with split stacks and the IR and DWARF for Rust programs now look pretty much the same as for similar C programs compiled with CLANG. It's possible that this problem would not occur with LLDB. I've not yet had a chance to try that.\n\nAll the changes mentioned above make sense and lead to cleaner line table generation. I'll prepare a pull request ASAP `:)` \n",
