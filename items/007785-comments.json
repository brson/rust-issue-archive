    "body": "I'm using this as part of #8655 .. I don't think it's that bad, tbh. But, yeah. open to suggestions.\n\nYou don't have to squint too hard to realize that this abstraction is derived from unix file mode flags passed to `open(2)`. And our initial impl atop libuv also uses the same flags. So it's working pretty well, there. But will that always be the case for other underlying io frameworks?\n",
