    "body": "Marking the inner closure as `move` as well makes the code compile. This seems like the intentional behaviour to me, because closures that aren\u2019t `move` capture all upvars by reference. (Well, [RFC 231](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0231-upvar-capture-inference.md) states that moving into non-`move` closures should also be possible, but that\u2019s not implemented at all yet.)\n",
