    "body": "I've been working on this somewhat in the background. The patch is somewhat more involved than I imagined initially because where clauses are more powerful than I initially imagined -- in particular, there are lots of bits of code that assume that there is an intrinsic set of bounds associated with a specific type parameter, whereas where clauses make those things scope dependent. We've been steadily removed them and by now all the deep connections are almost entirely eradicated (@pcwalton's work in #17864 is, I think, the last bit).\n\nIn my branch, I was removing all the lists of bounds from type parameters and adding in a list of predicates instead. It occurred to me today that it might also be possible to phase support for this in faster by doing it in two stages: first, leaving the code as is but adding a generalized list of predicates, and then removing the bounds lists. I'm not sure which is better.\n",
