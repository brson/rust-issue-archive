    "body": "The problem here is, I think, that the code that attempts to detect overflows only does so by detecting if the accumulator grows in the wrong direction, which only covers overflow for signed values. For it to detect this condition here, it also needs to check if the accumulator does not change, even though it should, or more generally, if it changes by a smaller value than it is supposed to.\n\nThe reported behavior happens because, after the algorithm reads in the first 64 `1`s, this happens for the accumulator at each new digit:\n\n```\n        1111...1111\n*= 2 -> 1111...1110\n+= 1 -> 1111...1111\n```\n\nso it never sees that the value gets smaller\n",
