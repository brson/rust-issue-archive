    "body": "> You\u2019d usually set CC to gcc -fdiagnostics-color=always and\n> RUSTC to rustc --color=always or something, no?\n\nAs you can see the --color option isn't standarized, so I have to\ncheck how it's called in every program. Also some build scripts set\nCC=clang to switch the compiler, which would deactivate colors again.\nAnd you forgot about CXX. Furthermore some build systems (like SCons)\ndon't check these variables at all.\n\nThe advantage of CLICOLOR(_FORCE) would be, that programs like a text\neditor or a ci server which pipe the build, could set them\nautomatically when they support parsing colors, no further\nconfiguration necessary.\n\n> Forcing Windows to use ANSI colours in any way is not acceptable.\n> Windows has its own colouring mechanism; why not specify this for\n> arbitrary colouring mechanism?\n\nThis isn't forcing Windows users to use ANSI colors. Windows users who\ndon't want to use them aren't affected by this. But this actually\nimproves the situation for Windows users who are using MSYS2: The\nMSYS2 terminal supports ANSI colors, but not terminfo. So rustc\ncurrently doesn't automatically output in color, which could be fixed\nwith setting `CLICOLOR=1`.\n\n> Since this \u201cspec\u201d is for ANSI colours, we technically already violate it in rustc by using proper colouring mechanisms on each platform.\n\nThe spec only tries to standardize what should happen when CLICOLOR\nand CLICOLOR_FORCE are set. If they aren't, nothing needs to change.\n\n> This implementation makes CLICOLOR=0 an equivalent for --color=never. While I find this behaviour sensible, it is not even noted in the linked summary.\n\nGood point, I've added it in the spec. Thanks :)\n",

    "body": "The problem with `RUSTFLAGS` is, that it's Rust specific. This PR is actually solving two real world problems I'm having: The first one is rustc's  colored output not working in atom-build and the second one is rustc's colored output not working in AppVeyor. Both could be fixed if this was merged. I could then just set `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1` for atom-build and AppVeyor (yes, AppVeyor supports ANSI escape codes). The advantage of a generic name instead of using `RUSTFLAGS` is, that I don't need to look up how every single program does it. For example if I also wanted to add something build by CMake in my atom-build/AppVeyor script, colored output would work out of the box.\nIn the ideal future atom-build and AppVeyor would have already set the environment variables for me. I'll will open feature requests for that as soon as more programs support `CLICOLOR_FORCE` (it's kind of a chicken-egg problem atm).\n",

    "body": "One other potential issue with this (an issue that also applies to GNU make's `MAKE_TERMOUT` and `MAKE_TERMERR` environment variables, documented at https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Terminal-Output): what happens if someone sets `CLICOLOR_FORCE` or `MAKE_TERMOUT` to indicate that output will (eventually) go to a terminal for output, but then some portion of the build system actually does want to redirect output to a file or pipe that won't eventually get printed to a terminal?  Does that part of the build system then need to explicitly _unset_ `CLICOLOR_FORCE` and `MAKE_TERMOUT` and any other variable the program might potentially respect, to make sure it won't include color in its output?  That seems likely to produce breakage.\n\nConsider if `grep` respected `CLICOLOR_FORCE` or `MAKE_TERMOUT`.  What would happen if a build system set one of those, and then somewhere deep in the build system (or even in a shell script called from the build system), someone ran grep in a pipeline, along with various other text processing commands?  If grep respected those environment variables, then that pipeline would break.\n\nI do like the idea of having a standard way to tell a program \"no, really, your output will wind up on the terminal, please print in color even though it doesn't look like a TTY\".  However, I don't think it makes sense to do so without a solution for this problem.  Not showing color output is an annoyance; breaking a build by printing color escape sequences to a pipe would be far worse.\n\n(This is also part of why programs like grep are removing environment variables like `GREP_OPTIONS`: they break scripts.)\n",

    "body": "The issue would be smaller if there was only one enivorment variable (`CLICOLOR_FORCE`) you'd have to think about. That's why I think a standard is needed, as other variables already exist (`CLANG_FORCE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS`, `FORCE_COLOR`, ...) and it's hard to keep track of all of them.\n\nThe Unix tools on OS X already respect `CLICOLOR_FORCE`, so you'll have to already keep that in mind in some cases.\n\n> Not showing color output is an annoyance; breaking a build by printing color escape sequences to a pipe would be far worse.\n\nIt isn't worse for me. Breaking a build is an annoyance which I can fix with a `CLICOLOR_FORCE=0` (not atm because of all the variables, but in a perfect world). Not showing colored output on the other hand makes reading output messages unbearable for me.\n",

    "body": "I'd certainly like to see a single variable like CLICOLOR that I can set to enable autodetection (to the extent that programs don't just default to it), and so that people who dislike color output can easily disable it.  However, I think forcing color via an environment variable will cause too many problems once more programs start looking at that variable, because the variable will persist in the environment even when redirecting output to somewhere that will not end up on a terminal.\n\nAnd while it's certainly possible that if you set CLICOLOR_FORCE=1 yourself you'd think to set it to 0, the possibility of such breakage would mean programs like make could never set it automatically (the way make currently sets MAKE_TERMOUT).\n\nAs an alternative solution, programs like make could collect output using a pty rather than a pipe or temp file; that would give the programs it spawns an actual try, so autodetection via isatty would Just Work.\n",

Atom is able to provide a fairly nice setup, but the loss of color output is enough to cause people to use a separate terminal window for running cargo, in order to get the colorized text output.  This leads to a less integrated experience (which, admittedly, is a minus for some, and a plus for others).  If there is a simple, universal means to turn the color on, such that it works in as many arenas Rust apps may be build as possible, it will be an overall win.\n",
