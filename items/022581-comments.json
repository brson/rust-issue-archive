    "body": "Unfortunately this is largely just where undefined behavior comes into play. Any read of undefined memory in LLVM will get propagated and then use of that read can trigger undefined behavior. In this sense the \"undefined behavior\" is that the optimizations assumed and invariant that was not true, producing code that segfaulted.\n\nIn general bugs which only appear with optimizations turned on are triggered by some form of undefined behavior in the code (such as using uninitialized memory in this case). It may be a bug sometimes, but this sounds like the former case. As a result, closing as working as intended.\n",
