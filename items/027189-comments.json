With large crates the process can continue for 20 seconds or more after reporting the first error, and this can affect workflow with tools like IntelliJ-Rust.\r\n\r\nThe upside is that this should be pretty easy to implement - perhaps even possible as a wrapper executable.

    "body": "FWIW, the reason I don\u2019t use a page is that it has to be exited manually. I also use an inotify-based script (similar to \"cargo watch\") to recompile automatically when a source file changes, so I only have to save from my editor to start a new compilation, no need to switch focus to the terminal. I imagine the inotify thing could be a background task that would kill the pager when it\u2019s time to recompile, but that seems more tricky and fragile.",

Now I need to read the error and realize it isn't an error before finding the actual issue. It would be so much easier if an actionable error was at the bottom of my terminal. This is legitimately my biggest complaint about rust. Very often the later errors are not problems at all, or are at least made more clear by fixing the earlier errors. I understand that some people like batch fixing errors but I definitely prefer the iterative style. This feature would help me stay focused on the errors that matter, instead of having to scroll around constantly.",

Isn\u2019t an auto-pager like git a better idea? Etc.\r\n\r\n<s>Such</s> Similar, even better, CLI option already exists, it's `RUSTFLAGS=\"-A warnings\"`, but it causes [project recompilation, probably for no good reason](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80863#issuecomment-757434010), which makes this flag completely useless, at least for middle size code base projects. This might be just a bug and I'm not sure whether it's hard to fix it without breaking something else.\r\n\r\nAlternative is probably much harder to implement: just have smarter compiler messages by default, no additional CLI options are needed. There are *some* cases when it might makes sense to see both errors and warnings in the same compiler output, but in many cases such warnings are just useless consequences of the errors, which steal our attention *a lot*. Is there any way to detect useless messages and ignore them?\r\n\r\nFor other insights and for anyone who suffer from this issue \u2014 please check out these [few ideas in this dirty limited workaround](https://github.com/alopatindev/cargo-limit#readme) I mentioned before. Thanks.\r\n\r\n> Does \"desperate\" mean willing to do the work?\r\n\r\nFor me specifically it means the following: please notice the issue and workaround for it, which exists there with a hope to give compiler team and anyone concerned some inspiration on how it can be fixed in the compiler/cargo; and yes far few of us *can* invest time in going through all the bureaucratic procedure of introducing MCP/RFC/etc. and all this, life is too short, but it doesn't mean this issue is not important and should be just ignored.\r\n",
