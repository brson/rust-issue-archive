  "body": "Make bors check `compiletest` builds from both stage0 and stage1 rustc\n\n---\n\nTo reproduce issue on commit ba246100ca3b0c3bd0d68548677d75e6790c4f60\nit does not suffice to add just `check-build-compiletest` to\n`check-secondary`; one must also ensure that `check-build-compiletest`\nprecedes the satisification of the `check` rule.\n\nOtherwise hidden dependencies of `compiletest` would end up getting\nsatisfied when make builds `rustc` at each stage in order to\neventually run `check-stage2`.\n\nSo to handle that I moved `check-secondary` before `check` in the\n`check-all` rule that bors uses, and for good measure, I also put\n`check-build-compiltest` at the front of the `check-secondary` rule's\ndependencies.\n\nMy understanding is that running `check-secondary` should be\nrelatively cheap, and thus such a reordering will not hurt bors.\n\n---\n\nFix #17883.\n",
