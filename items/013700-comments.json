    "body": "I don't really like `re` because I think it's _too short_. Note that Python's original regexp module was called `regex`. (`re` was added in Python 1.5 and `regex` wasn't removed until Python 2.5, so they had to coexist.) I do like the notion of writing `re::Regexp`, but I also think it's useful for the name of the crate to stand on its own.\n\nI would not be opposed to naming the macro `re!` though, it seemed like there was some value in making it the same name as the crate. I don't feel strongly about it.\n- Languages that use some variation of `regexp`: Go, Ruby, Javascript\n- Languages that use some variation of `regex`: C++, Java, Python, OCaml, Haskell\n\n(The .NET crowd is notably missing, but they call their module `RegularExpressions`. Objective C calls theirs `NSRegularExpression`.)\n\nI don't know what it means to choose one name over another based on Google Trends telling me that there is a `0.0000098675%` difference between the two in 2008.\n\nThere seems to be a slight overall preference toward `Regex` and there are more language libraries using `Regex` as the name of their module which provides regexps. If I switch the name of the crate, type and macro to `regex`, `Regex` and `regex!`, respectively, will that make everyone reasonably happy?\n",

    "body": "> If I switch the name of the crate, type and macro to Regex, Regex and regex!, respectively, will that make everyone reasonably happy?\n\nCount me for that one, `Regex` that is. I don't like `RegEx`; that uppercase 'E' adds a break in the flow of typing it, and `reg_ex` is just plain ugly. I also agree `re` is too short, and adding a `p` at the end of `regex` just makes it weird.\n\nI think `Regex` is the best.\n",
