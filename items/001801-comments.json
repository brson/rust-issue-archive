Moreover, users can now move the stack switch so it occurs earlier, which helps to eliminate overhead. However, the mechanism itself is still probably too slow -- though whether it can be further optimized is unclear, @pcwalton thought no. Certainly we can't eliminate the megamorphic call site that Brian referred to.\n",
