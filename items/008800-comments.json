That way it'll be conveniently closed when the commit is merged into master.\n\nAlso, I think you can remove the comment about it being a \"bogus ref\" because it's a legitimate way to write a pattern binding.\n\nI think that it'd also be a good idea to add a test for the original code as well as compile-fail, thanks!\n",
