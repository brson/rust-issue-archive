The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Personally, I agree with @steveklabnik  that the code before was more readable. With the new version, it's less obvious that e.g. the `done` flag goes from `false` to `true` but never vice-versa (I had to think about it for a second). I also would prefer redundant parens to make visually parsing more obvious: `x = (y == 2)`. But anyway if I were writing this code for _real_, I'd use `loop` and `break` and drop the `done` variable altogether -- but that wouldn't demonstrate a `while` loop, so it makes for a poor example. :)\n\nIn any case, I'm going to close this PR and advocate leaving the code as is, but thank you for the suggestion in any case.\n",
