    "body": "maybe we need to parametrize Allocators with a lifetime. `Heap` for example would be `Heap<'static>`, The allocating method would return `*'a mut T` and `Box` and friends will become `Box<'a>` where `'a` is `'static`. but this would be overkill though. So let me throw a fancy proposal:\n- Allocators are parametrized with a lifetime, the allocating method (`unsafe fn raw_alloc(..)`) returns a `BarePtr<'a, T>` since `*'a mut T` pointers are not supported.\n- create new variants of smart pointers (`BoxIn<T, Allocator<'a>>`, ... and so on).\n- `Box<T>` and friends are the equivalents of `BoxIn<T, Allocator<'static>>`, Rc<T, ...\n\nthat way, arenas will feel first class and usable with `BoxIn`, `RcIn` ...\n\nThe last discussion related to these things and which i am aware of is this https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/workweek-2014-08-18/box-and-allocators.md\n\nan other issue i can think of is about the mutabiliy of the self argument in `unsafe fn raw_alloc(&self, size: uint, alignment: uint) -> *mut u8;`. for arenas, i like `&self` to be `&mut self` so that the compiler disallows aliasing the arena concurrently. In the other hand, self must be `&self` to support static allocators. maybe arenas are so different that we should not try to unify them with other allocatros.\n",

A typed-specialized `TypedReap<T>` seems like it would be especially easy to make atop `TypedArena<T>`.  (This is going a little bit further than what is being suggested in this issue, but if you're going to already go all the way to having an `ArenaPtr` smart pointer, then you might as well use a reap, I think.)\n",

    "body": "@NawfelBengherbia it's actually (as seen in the implementation of `Vec` and other abstractions):\n\n``` rust\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        unsafe {\n            ptr::read(self.ptr); // could be wrapped in drop(...)\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n**EDIT**: oops, got confused by the direct imports of functions and thought `replace` was from `mem` and not `ptr`, so the issue is less obvious.\nStill, I wouldn't use `uninitialized` like that, it's for optimization purposes, i.e. avoiding operations as long as the behavior of the program is not dependent on the value produced.\n\nHang on, I would actually expect LLVM to optimize out an `uninit` store, did you compile with optimizations or without?\n",

    "body": "@eddyb i don't have rust installed in my laptop. I ran my code in: http://play.rust-lang.org/ which was compiling with \"-O2\". I've just tested with other optimization levels and I'm getting the desired output with -O0, -O1 and -O3\n\nAnd since I am experimenting with the language, i rewrote the allocator here: https://gist.github.com/NawfelBengherbia/1b990d0f5c0c11cd0930 . In this implementation, i swap the content of the arena temporarily to take ownership and avoid fighting the borrow checker. the resulting code is much more comprehensible.\n",
