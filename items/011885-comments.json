    "body": "This looks great, thanks!\n\nWe're generally trying to remove conditions, and I'd rather fail for now instead of silently going to the default stack size. We can see what this buys us down the road, but I would imagine that you've covered most use cases with rounding/clamping.\n\nOne thing that I also wanted to take care of here was dealing with the `std::unstable::stack::RED_ZONE` constant. Right now a stack requests N bytes of stack, but it is considered as having overflowed the stack when it consumes (N - RED_ZONE) bytes of stack. This red zone is used to allow the stack-overflow code to run, and also in theory allow some user destructors to run (run during unwinding). We currently don't make much use of it (except for printing that you've overflowed), but it should probably get factored into these computations.\n\nWhat'll happen now is that if you request a stack size of `4096` you'll immediately overflow (probably in some runtime code) and trigger a runtime abort. Could you alter the `min_stack_size()` return value to also add in the `RED_ZONE` constant? Something like that at least. The idea would be to _always_ allow at least _some_ code to run regardless of the stack size provided.\n\nDoes that make sense? I may have wandered off a bit on some tangents...\n\nThis is also is a problem for allocating green stacks, but that can be dealt with in a separate commit.\n",
