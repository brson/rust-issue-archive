    "body": "This looks good to me, but I really like the name `find_with_or_insert_with` over `mangle`. It's a lot more descriptive.\n\nI still think that there's some space for a better `HashMap` API here. Since the only efficiency gain is in not allowing the same key to be hashed twice, maybe there could be a function like `HashMap::hash_key<'a>(k: &'a K) -> HashedKey<'a>`, and then add versions of each hashmap operation that works on `HashedKey`s instead of keys.\n\nJust my little design ramblings. Feel free to merge as is.\n",
