    "body": "This is some fun bug in glob imports (in name resolution, not in privacy, strictly speaking).\nGlob imports normally import only `pub` items, but it seems like a `pub` glob import from a module suddenly marks all other imports from this module as public (effectively).\nThis compiles, but it shouldn't, because the name `S` shouldn't be in the module `m` at all. (Or at least it should be private, but it's not how non-`pub` imports work currently.)\n\n```\nstruct S;\n\nmod m {\n    use super::S;\n    pub use super::*;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let s = m::S;\n}\n```\n\nSlight variations like\n\n```\n    // use super::S;\n    pub use super::*;\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n    use super::S;\n    // pub use super::*;\n```\n\nor even\n\n```\n    pub use super::*;\n    use super::S;\n```\n\nfail with `unresolved name`m::S`, i.e. the order of imports is significant! (cc @vberger)\n\nThe incorrect `unused import` warning may be a consequence of this problem, or a totally separate bug, I don't know.\n",

    "body": "@sanxiyn @petrochenkov the incorrect `unused import` is a consequence of that problem.\nThe problem is that the visibility of a glob import overwrites the visibilities of any existing imports that share a name with a private item in the module being glob imported from.\nFor example,\n\n``` rust\npub fn f() {}\npub mod foo {\n    fn f() {}\n}\n\nmod bar {\n    pub use f;\n    pub use f as g;\n    use foo::*; // This makes first import private but does not affect the second import.\n}\n\nmod baz {\n    use f;\n    pub use foo::*; // This makes the above import public\n}\n```\n\nIn the original example, the visibility of the first import `use super::Trait;` was made public by `pub use super::*;` since the first import shares a name (`Trait`) with a private item in the module being glob imported from (`super`). Were it not for this bug, `Trait` would be private, the second glob import would not import it, and the code would not compile.\n\nThis problem is due to a bug in `merge_import_resolution`, specifically [this line](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/resolve_imports.rs#L923), which overwrites the visibility of an imported name regardless of whether it gets duplicate checked and defined in either namespace.\n\nI fixed this problem in PR #30294 while fixing a very closely related issue.\n",
