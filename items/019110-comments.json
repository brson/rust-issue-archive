For that reason, this may want to hold off on the `change_dir` => `chdir` rename for now.\n\nAdditionally, the `make_absolute` => `abspath` change seems related to https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/474 so you may want to coordinate with @aturon on that as well.\n",

    "body": "I'm just a bit confused of dealing with the different conventions at the same time. If we can use the descriptive names for other methods in the `os` module as well, I don't care. (Such like `setenv()` -> `set_env_var()`?)\n\nBut I also think that if we are to unify the names into the descriptive fashion, the required changes should be larger than the reverse. So I think sticking to POSIX is still a viable option.\n\nOne thing to note, which is slightly (not?) related to this problem is, that the reason why `make_absolute()` is in `os` is that it depends on `os::getcwd()`. I'm not sure this is a valid design, because to me, it seems to be natural that the method is part of `Path`. Maybe we can discuss this at rust-lang/rfcs#474.\n",

    "body": "Yes there are definitely conflicting conventions throughout `std::io::fs` and `std::os`, but these are slated to be dealt with when the modules are considered for API stabilization. The POSIX naming convention is definitely a viable option, but we need to have an overall vision for the entire set of I/O apis instead of locally optimizing one module only to maybe have it change radically later.\n\nI also agree that `os::make_absolute` is odd when I would expect it in the `path` module!\n",
