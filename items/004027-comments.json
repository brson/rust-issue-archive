    "body": "Ok, so I did a little more investigating. Moving the chan/port into the function works, however that does mean that you now can't use it inside a heap closure, as you cannot move out of a heap closure (like, oh, I don't know the most common way of spawning a new task).\n\nI.E. This works:\n\n```\nlet (chan, port) = pipes::oneshot();\npipes::send_one(move chan, true);\n```\n\nbut this does not:\n\n```\nlet (chan, port) = pipes::oneshot();\ntask::spawn |move chan| {\n    pipes::send_one(chan, true);\n    //pipes::send_one(move chan, true);// Neither work\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how this should be fixed now though, since channels/ports shouldn't be copyable but you also need to handle the second case above. Maybe some liveness stuff?\n",
