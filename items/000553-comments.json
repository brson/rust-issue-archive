Then we could build a variety of safer abstractions on top (lazily-initialized singletons, single-writer / multi-reader dataflow variables, etc.)\n\nIOW I still think this is something we should be getting to.

    "body": "Ok, spent a few more hours sketching and came up with slightly fighter design. Criticism / modification welcome.\n- Declaring a mutable global (`let x : foo = <const_expr>;`) is legal anywhere ourside fns. Not unsafe.\n- Reading or writing from such a global _is_ unsafe.\n- We either extend the word `const` to be a type operator that strips all `mut` qualifiers from its operand (to unlimited depth), or implement a `const` kind that is a subkind of `send`. \n- We implement (in library code) a bunch of 1-argument enums that wrap pointers / other atomic datatypes, and have methods that safely / atomically implement better things:\n  - Mutexes, cvars, semaphores. Straight-up old-fashioned per-process global bottlenecks. Sometimes you need one.\n  - Write-once, read-many global w/ static initializer function. First reader CAS-reserves the word, runs the initializer, writes the result and registers a global `atexit`-like cleanup function with the runtime. Constrained to work kind `const`, or `send` on a type that is `const`'ed in the result of the `get` method.\n  - Broadcast globals similar to the write-once case, except no static initializer. Anyone can write to it, repeatedly; the readers borrow a region-pointer (presumably from an `@`-box or something) that's kept alive for the duration of the `get()` call and its callback.\n  - Task-local general-purpose values. Not necessarily even using a mutable global. Can just use the address of a `const` item as a key into a per-task hashtable, as @brson mentions above.\n  - Task-local _dynamically scoped_ general-purpose values. Really just a task-local list with methods for binding a new head-of-list and getting the current head-of-list. Nothing too crazy.\n",
