Initially I thought it would be necessary to thread this data\nthrough not only the AST but the types themselves, but then I remembered that\nthe pretty printer only cares about the AST.  Regardless, I have elected to\nleave the changes to the types intact since they will eventually be needed.  I\nleft a few FIXMEs where it didn't seem worth finishing up since the code wasn't\ncrucial yet.\n",
