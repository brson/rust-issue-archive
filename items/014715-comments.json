But once I've started removing them I've remembered why I didn't finish it on the first PR - there are too many places where dylibs are expected. Moreover, if I just disable them without forcing static library generation -> there were problems with linking, as I remember it was impossible to generate a static library with stdlib built as rlib only. I think proper fix for this might require quite a lot of changes, may be even more than is in this PR.\n",
