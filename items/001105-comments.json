The result is that functions get a little better documentation, but are much more annoying to use.\n\nPart of the problem might be that we just haven't developed typestate far enough to make it pleasant. Function postconditions, for example, along with carefully designed APIs, could make some predicates hold across longer regions of code. As it is though, there aren't a lot of fans right now among the core developers.\n\nIt does make me sad. So much of error handling is coping with bad input, and I was really excited by the prospect of not worring about it. Unfortunately, with the current state of typestate, it makes the implementor's life easy while making the user's life absolutely terrible.\n",

Lots of the problems with typestate as it is now may be process issues, i.e. you need to develop/design differently to make full use of it (wonder what eiffelists and DbC people have written about this).  \n\nIt may also be a good idea to take the extra step and allow limited forms of inference to make typestate more useful though this first would require more experience with using them (inference opportunities: length predicates on vecs, set intersection for (remaining) possible tag variants of a value, logical connectives)\n",
