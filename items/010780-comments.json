    "body": "Can `-Z no-landing-pads` work for static and dynamic libraries?\n\nThis is similar to #11871 where we have a language feature that has a runtime dependency, but it can't be turned off, and you wouldn't want to accidentally combine crates with the wrong options. Perhaps we can add something to the metadata to record which runtime features were in use, and start adding these options.\n",
