    "body": "Hi! I'm just commenting here because I've already been using my own personal binding to the dynamical link libraries facilities on Linux here: http://gitorious.org/rust-dlfcn/rust-dlfcn/trees , and so have some experience with the issues involved in this. Firstly, is there a way to have something like #[cfg (posix)](it just bugs me that all the platforms are explicitly layed out?) Secondly, I don't think the return value of get_symbol is quite right. Can't a pointer of lifetime 'r still point to a pointer of lifetime 's which may be greater than the 'r? Unfortunately, this is not implemented yet but i believe the proper way to accomplish this would be to use some kind of constraint over T, as in T : 'r (I might be mistaken, I'm unsure of this.) Finally, it just bugs me that get_symbol is not labelled as an unsafe function. Can name mangling guarantee that the result will always be of the right type? If so, than the interface could be revised to have two functions, an unsafe get_symbol, and a safe get_mangled_symbol. Thank you very much for this start in making the Rust compiler more extensible.\n",

    "body": "@sstewartgallus I like your interface. (I can't quite believe I forgot about `Path`.)\n\nAnd you raise a good point, I think `T` should really be restricted to `'static`, possibly with `Owned` and/or `Const` bounds (since these are always global symbols), however the point of the lifetimes is to try to make sure the pointer in to the library is valid (i.e. the dynamic library hasn't been closed), not say anything about the value it points to.\n\nFor my implementation, `get_symbol` isn't unsafe: it can never cause a crash (assuming that dlsym doesn't crash on invalid input (?)), since the only way to use the return value is via the `TaggedSymbol` type. The `.get` method on this type _is_ dangerous, and is marked `unsafe`.\n\n(I have no idea about name mangling, this could be a higher level interface built on top of the dynamic library wrappers.)\n\n(I wouldn't be upset if you were to get a dl interface into Rust, over the one I have here.)\n",
