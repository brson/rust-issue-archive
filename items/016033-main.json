  "body": "Previously the implementation of Hash was limited to tuples of up to arity 8. This increases it to tuples of up to arity 12. \n\nAlso, the implementation macro for `Hash` used to expand to something like this:\n\n```\nimpl Hash for (a7,)\nimpl Hash for (a6, a7)\nimpl Hash for (a5, a6, a7)\n...\n```\n\nThis style is inconsistent with the implementations in core::tuple, which look like this:\n\n```\nimpl Trait for (A,)\nimpl Trait for (A, B)\nimpl Trait for (A, B, C)\n...\n```\n\nThis is perhaps a minor point, but it does mean the documentation pages are inconsistent. Compare the tuple implementations in the documentation for [Hash](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/hash/trait.Hash.html) and [PartialOrd](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/core/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html)\n\nThis changes the Hash implementation to be consistent with `core::tuple`.\n",
