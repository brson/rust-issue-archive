It's really nice to call static methods on traits on type parameters, but it's not so nice to call static methods on traits directly.\n\nIf I saw `let stat = Default::default()` I wouldn't get nearly as much meaning out of it as `let stat = stat::default_stat()` or something like that. I may be one of just a few who feel this way, though, but I personally prefer to avoid invoking static methods directly on traits.\n",

    "body": "I think that the use of default to fill in missing fields is such a common pattern that it deserves a feature like the Default trait.  But I agree that having to write `Default::default()` sucks.  It seems straightforward to improve: all that would be needed is a standalone `std::default::default` function just like `std::num::zero` has: `fn default<T: Default>() -> T { Default::default() }`.  You could then use `default()` where needed without having to mention the trait.  (And in places where it's not obvious or inferable you'd have `default::<stat>()`.)\n\nGiven that the usual answer to optional/named parameters is \"use a struct,\" and given that there is special treatment for Default already (the \"deriving\" attribute) I also think both the `Default` trait and the aforementioned standalone `default` function should be added to the prelude.  \n\nWould that make it feel less immoral?\n\nIn any case, here I'm just trying to make it possible to use `stat` without writing separate code for each platform, while staying with the convention that is established in the code as it exists...\n",

    "body": "I'm going to close this an #9637 because I don't think that this is the right way to go about doing this. The `stat` syscall itself should not be getting used, and we don't want to encourage use of it. Instead the `stat` portions of `rt::io::file` should be getting used, and it's currently a legacy bug that the `Path` apis are still using these old stat structures (see #9958). Once we remove the consumers of those stat structures, then there's no need for this in `libstd`.\n\nIf it does end up being a large use case that external code needs to call `libc::stat`, then we can reconsider. For now it's still possible with a malloc and size_of, and it's certainly not the best interface but it gets the job done.\n",
