    "body": "Links would be very helpful. The menu is great for getting to specific sections quickly, but I find it slightly annoying if I just want to get to the next page, as I have to think about the name of the page I'm on before locating it in the menu.\n\nI'd say links throughout the whole book would be helpful. While the pages in the first section are intended to be in order, the self-contained topics in the other sections have an implicit order from the way they are arranged in the menu. Without links, I also think the chapter introductions also appear a bit strange to me (too sparse) ([example](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/intermediate.html)).\n\nAdditionally, some of the topics seem to flow anyway, such as the [Generics](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/generics.html) section leading into [Traits](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/traits.html). Either way, for someone like me who is excited about Rust, but has yet to dig in properly, I would want to go through all the sections if possible and read everything. I suspect there will be many more people like me as Rust approaches the 1.0 beta and final releases. In this case, links are a great convenience, while everyone still has menu navigation available to use if they so wish.\n\nI've been playing around with markdown, but am not completely sure how to make these links look nice. Things like alignment don't seem to be possible in normal markdown, though on GitHub at least I'm able to embed some simple html. I'm not sure if this works for rustbook however.\n\nAnyway to give an example, I've considered appending something like this to the end of each page:\n\n---\n\n<h6 align=right><a href=\"standard-input.md\">next: Standard Input</a></h6>\n\n<h6 align=right><a href=\"strings.md\">previous: Strings</a></h6>\n\nThe specific text could change depending on the context of the page. (e.g. \"next section: Intermediate Rust\" or \"next topic: Pointers\").\n\nIt would be nice actually if this insertion and naming of links could be done programatically by rustbook. It would leave the markdown files clean for any tool that builds an ePub (see #20866), and avoids the need to keep manually changing the links if pages are reordered/added/deleted/renamed. While the summary doesn't provide information for a \"next topic\" style link, it certainly provides enough for the \"next\" and \"next section\" links, and rustdoc seems to use this information already to generate the menu.\n\nFor now though, I don't mind doing this manually as a temporary solution until something automated can be put into place, assuming my suggestion is good in the first place.\n",
