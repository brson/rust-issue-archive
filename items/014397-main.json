  "body": "DST coercions and DST fields in structs\n\nThe commits are not quite stand alone, I should probably squash them together before landing. In particular if you review the individual commits, then you'll see some scrappy stuff that gets fixed in later commits. But reading the commits in order might be easier to get an overall idea of what is going on.\n\nThe first commit includes putting back time zone into our time library - @pcwalton removed that as part of his de-~str'ing, but I had already converted it to use StrBuf, so we may as well leave it in. Update: no longer, this is removed in a later commit.\n",
