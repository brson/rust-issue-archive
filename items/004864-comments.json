    "body": "A functional manner of doing this would be to use a match expression such as:\n\n```\nfn lookup_table(key: &str) -> Option<uint> {\n    match key {\n        \"foo\" => Some(0),\n        \"bar\" => Some(1),\n        \"car\" => Some(2),\n        _ => None\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA macro could easily be created that would provide a nicer syntax for this.
