    "body": "First off, thanks! I've been meaning to get building on arm work (in a non-adhoc manner).\n\nI think it'd be better to just remove all the `-m32` flags sprawled around and instead just have it one place. So something like:\n\n``` bash\ncase \"$CFG_C_COMPILER\" in\n    (\"ccache clang\")\n    ...\n    ;;\n    (\"gcc\")\n    ...\n    ;;\n    # etc\nesac\n\ncase \"$CFG_CPUTYPE\" in\n    (x86*)\n    LLVM_CXX_32=\"$LLVM_CXX_32 -m32\"\n    LLVM_CC_32=\"$LLVM_CC_32 -m32\"\n    ;;\nesac\n```\n\nThat way we wouldn't have to have all those comparisons against `armv7l` since there are definitely other platforms that'll have the same issue.\n\nAlso, for the libcpp stuff, I think it'd be better if there was a flag like `ENABLE_LLVM_LIBCPP` and then in the armv7l case where we're setting `CFG_CPUTYPE` we can set that flag to 0. That way if any other platform needs to enable/disable they can easily do and we avoid having to single out just `armv7l`.\n\nIt'd also probably be fine to just squash those commits into one. With all that, r=me.\n",
