    "body": "Just noting some discussion that was tangentially related to this:\n\nThe current hasher infra heavily penalizes Farmhash (and cityhash, and murmurhash), which wants to branch on the size of the input to choose the \"optimal\" algorithm. Community's current solution is to just buffer in a Vec until `finish` is called. This appears to be overkill, at least in the case of Farmhash.\n\nHowever more generally it would be nice (even for SipHash) to be able to to indicate to the hasher \"there is only one thing to hash, here it is, now give me the final hash\". Sketch of design:\n\nadd:\n\n``` rust\npub trait Hasher {\n    ...\n    /// Hash only the given bytes, and immediately finalize.\n    /// Results are unspecified if other bytes were previously written to this hasher\n    fn write_only(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) -> u64 {\n        self.write(bytes);\n        self.finish()\n    }\n}\n\npub trait Hash {\n    ...\n    /// Hashes only this value\n    fn hash_one_shot<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) -> u64 {\n        self.hash(state);\n        state.finish()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo far, so pointless. But back-compat!\n\nBut now hashers can override write_only to something optimized, and Hash impls can specialize in the following way:\n\n``` rust\n// #[derive]d impl\nimpl Hash {\n   fn hash() { ... } // same-old\n\n   #[if(only_has_one_field)]  // magic\n   fn hash_one_shot<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) -> u64 {\n      self.only_field.hash_one_shot(state)\n   }\n}\n```\n\nAnd key types like `slice`, `str`, primitives, etc can manually impl `hash_one_shot`:\n\n``` rust\nfn hash_one_shot<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) -> u64 {\n    state.write_only(self.as_slice())\n}\n```\n\nHowever we must be wary of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/5257!\n\nIn particular, slices and strs must mix in some \"bonus\" value so that `(\"aa\", \"a\")` does not hash the same as `(\"a\", \"aa\")`. My proposed solution to this is simple, but sketchy: _have has_one_shot and hash do different things_. one_shot knows it's the only thing in existence, and so doesn't need to mix in the bonus data to prevent concatenation collisions. hash doesn't, so it has to conservatively mix in the bonus data.\n\nThis seems really sketchy, but I can't think of a situation where this would actually break things. You will get potentially curious behaviour, where `&[\"hello\"]` doesn't hash to the same thing as \"hello\" or `(\"hello\",)`, but this doesn't seem like a serious problem. They're fundamentally different types! Anyone relying on them hashing the same is in a pretty dubious position. Alternatively, in the case of slices, you could actually have them branch at runtime on their `len` to determine whether to call `hash` or `hash_one_shot` on their elements.\n\nI've been flying around the country and haven't slept though. \n",

    "body": "@Gankro I'm exploring a slightly different design here: https://github.com/ranma42/rust-hash/tree/master/src\n\nBesides from the naming, which can obviously be made more consistent with that currently used in Rust, the main difference is that the stream-oriented part of the code is aggressively inlined. Ideally I would want the implementation of one-shot digest to be automatically generated by the compiler, which should be able to get rid of the streaming overhead simply with constant folding and dead code elimination.\n\nThis actually happens in the branch I posted, namely the `digest` method for `[u8]` does not contain the `tail` and `ntail` variables nor the buffered tail flushing loop. Even better, for `u8` the `length` variable gets optimised away, too.\n\nThe usual structure of hash functions makes me wonder whether there is much to gain by having `write_u8`, `write_u16`, etc. My main objection is that most hash functions do not consume a single byte, but a block of bytes every \"step\". This means that some kind of buffering and re-alignment is going to be needed in most cases, probably removing any opportunity for effective optimisations.\nI believe that a much more effective approach is to have `digest_u8`, `digest_u16` and so on (in the equivalent of my `HashFunction` trait, which I believe currently is `HashState`), because this would ensure that the initialisation and finalisation of the hash context can be folded into the computation and that no re-alignment is needed. Additionally for the primitive types `{u,i}_{size,8,16,32,64}` the fixed length means that the code for most hash functions would be very easy to automatically optimise by the compiler.\nI wonder if it might even make sense to add a dispatch for `[u8]` slices that optimises a small number of fixed sizes (basically arrays up to a certain size)... I will know after some more experimentation ;)\n",

    "body": "From the point-of-view of a consumer of the API, I've found it to be pleasing enough to use, especially because of the `Default` implementations. Basically I've just added the hasher's type parameter to my hashmap's declaration and made sure to use `Default::default()` to construct it instead of `HashMap::new()`:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nuse twox_hash::RandomXxHashState;\n\nlet mut hash: HashMap<_, _, RandomXxHashState> = Default::default();\nhash.insert(42, \"the answer\");\nassert_eq!(hash.get(&42), Some(&\"the answer\"));\n```\n\nFrom an implementor point-of-view, I'll softly agree with @ranma42's point:\n\n> To me, the naming of Hasher and HashState is quite unintuitive.\n\nIn my mind, the _state_ of the hash is the internal bits-and-bobs that change every time you add more data to be hashed. In the usage of twox-hash, it's really more like the \"state\" is a seed and the \"hasher\" contains the real state.\n\nHowever, looking back from a user POV, neither \"state\" nor \"seed\" sound great when you write the declaration (`HashMap<_, _, RandomXxHashState>`).\n\nNaming is hard!\n\nFalling into Java naming land, the parameter to the `HashMap` is really a factory. `XxHashFactory` is OK, but then we add the complication of the randomness. `RandomXxHashFactory` _sounds_ like it creates a randomly-seeded `XxHash` each time you call it, but in reality it generates the random number once _when the factory is constructed_. Doing the former doesn't work so well, ask me how I know :innocent: .\n\nFrom a pragmatic POV, there will probably never be more than ~100 implementations of hash algorithms, so it's a very small number of people that will have to struggle with this. That may mean it's not worth spending enormous amounts of time on this naming.\n\nThere will be many more people who _use_ a custom hash algorithm, so as long as the implementations have a nice bit of example of \"use it like this\", it will probably be just fine.\n",

I agree that the naming here perhaps isn't the best, although I am also at a bit of a loss of what would fit as a good name.\n\nFor construction of a custom hash map, though, you can even use `HashMap::default()` as the method name instead of `Default::default` but I suspect that'll have more of an impact on aesthetics than anything because the hash algorithm otherwise still needs to be annotated (requiring a `HashMap` elsewhere).\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I mentioned that context (`HashContext`) might be a better name for the \"state\" (at least more in line with the standard naming in OpenSSL and crypto++), i.e. the object in which you accumulate a stream/message (usually through an `update` operation, not a `write`) and which is finalised to a message digest.\n\nIn the stub library I wrote, I named `HashFunction` the trait which exposes an operation to convert a byte sequence (`&[u8]`) to a message digest (something like `hash_one_shot`, which in a way is the usual concept of \"hash function\", something that maps byte seqs to constant-sized message digests) and an additional operation to extract a new `HashContext`. In a way, `HashFunction` roughly corresponds to `HashState` (except that it adds `hash_one_shot`), while `HashContext` corresponds to `Hasher` in `std`.\n\nWould it still be possible to rename these traits (and maybe their methods)? Although the names I proposed may not be much easier to understand, they would align with the existing nomenclature. This would at least make them easier to use for people which is already using them in other languages (and it would provide nice consistency for anybody writing library bindings/wrappers).\n",

    "body": "Hm yeah `HashContext` may make more sense, although what's stored in `HashMap` is actually distinct from the object which you feed data into. The actual hash algorithm's state may require more storage than what's needed to create a fresh new state. For example FNV hashing requires no \"startup state\" whereas SipHash requires 128 bits. In both cases, though, the intermediate state during hashing is larger.\n\nRegardless I think it's still possible to tweak some naming here. If larger changes happen, however, then I think we'll have to punt on this until another cycle.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Yes, in the `HashMap` you would be storing a `HashFunction` object, not a `HashContext`, as you want something that can map keys to digest values, not an object in which you accumulate messages to obtain a single digest upon finalisation.\n\nIn my stub library, the object hierarchy is designed so that the additional state (seeds, initialization vectors, number of ruounds/passes, any parameters) of the hashing algorithm belongs to the object implementing the `HashFunction` trait. Hash functions are thus seen as a family of functions parametrised on seed & co.\n\nThis has the convenient advantage that in most cases the initialisation data does not need to be stored in the context (for example, the `SipContext` here does not contain `k0` or `k1`) https://github.com/ranma42/rust-hash/blob/master/src/sip.rs#L25 . The tradeoff is that `SipContext` is unable to reset its own state, you need to get a new one from a `SipHashFunction` object.\nThe naming I used is mostly based on the idea that a `HashFunction` is meant to be a function from `&[u8]` to the digest type, so any additional parameters of the hash algorithm can be used to define which specific hash function you are looking for.\n\nI did some more work on this, but I did not clean it up and push it to the public repo, but since there seem to be some interest, I will try to get around to it this weekend.\n",

EDIT: \"function\" is appropriate when you think of it as the message digest function, but it might be misleading when it is being used as a `HashContext` factory. Nonetheless to me it expresses the purpose of the object in a more clear way, especially as it does not imply a state. In fact, from my point of view a `HashFn` should have no (mutable) state; instead it should be a closure of  (immutable) parameters.\n",

    "body": "Ok, I took a look again and I think I remembered my main objection to this API from before. So one thing I might expect is the ability to specify a closure as the \"custom hasher\", for example to do something like:\n\n``` rust\nHashMap::new_with_hasher(|key| key.precalculated_hash);\n```\n\nThe idea here is that it should actually be super easy to go from a key to some precalculated hash. This is unfortunately, however, not possible today! You can actually look up infinitely many types in a hash map due to `get<Q>(...) where K: Borrow<Q>`. This means that the custom hasher must be able to hash more than one type, and the only way to do that via the closure idea above is some form of HKT (I believe), which is a bit of aways out.\n\nSo my \"objection\" from before I don't think really matters, as if the API is able to hash infinitely many types I think it's basically how it would be expressed today. You put a thing that can hash things in a hash map, and then every time you look something up you create a hasher, the type feeds itself in, and then you pluck out the hash value. Note that functionally you can do what I did above (e.g. have a precalculated hash), it's just slightly more roundabout.\n\nSo with that in mind I'm comfortable stabilizing this as-is modulo some renamings here and there. I agree with @shepmaster that while although not the most ergonomic it's unlikely to _define_ new hashers. Consumption of these hashers, however, is simply `HashMap::default()` (and `HashMap::new()` once we have default type parameters affecting inference), so I'm not too worried about the ergonomics there as it's basically what you'd expect.\n",

    "body": "The libs team discussed this during triage and the decision was to **tentatively stabilize**. I'm going to hold off on this from the initial round of stabilizations because we'd like to get some feedback on naming. We agree that renaming `HashState` was needed and reached consensus on the names:\n\n``` rust\ntrait MakeHasher {\n    type Hasher;\n    fn make_hasher(&self) -> Hasher;\n}\n\nimpl HashMap<K, V, H: MakeHasher> {\n    fn with_hasher(hasher: H) { ... }\n    fn with_capacity_and_hasher(hasher: H) { ... }\n}\n```\n\nThe old names can likely continue to work through a series of deprecation renamings and blanket trait impls for the new trait, but we're curious to hear thoughts on this naming as well. The first beta build may not have this stabilization inside of it, but we're willing to backport within the first week of the next cycle or so!\n",

    "body": "> the builder pattern in Rust already has a concept [...] which this isn't quite the same as\n\nI guess I'd disagree. For example, I could see some code like:\n\n``` rust\ntrait BuildHasher {\n    type Hasher;\n\n    fn build_hasher(&self) -> Self::Hasher;\n}\n\nstruct MyCoolHash {\n    seed: u32,\n    stream: u32,\n}\n\nstruct MyCoolHashBuilder {\n    seed: u32,\n    stream: u32,\n}\n\nimpl MyCoolHashBuilder {\n    fn new() -> Self {\n        MyCoolHashBuilder {\n            seed: 0, // make a random seed\n            stream: 1, // make a random stream\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn seed(self, seed: u32) -> Self {\n        MyCoolHashBuilder {\n            seed: seed,\n            ..self\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn stream(self, stream: u32) -> Self {\n        MyCoolHashBuilder {\n            stream: stream,\n            ..self\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl BuildHasher for MyCoolHashBuilder {\n    type Hasher = MyCoolHash;\n\n    fn build_hasher(&self) -> Self::Hasher {\n        MyCoolHash {\n            seed: self.seed,\n            stream: self.stream,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ntrait BuildHasher {\n    type Hasher;\n\n    fn build_hasher(&self) -> Self::Hasher;\n}\n\nstruct MyCoolHash {\n    seed: u32,\n    stream: u32,\n}\n\nstruct MyCoolHashBuilder {\n    seed: u32,\n    stream: u32,\n}\n\nimpl MyCoolHashBuilder {\n    fn new() -> Self {\n        MyCoolHashBuilder {\n            seed: 0, // make a random seed\n            stream: 1, // make a random stream\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn seed(self, seed: u32) -> Self {\n        MyCoolHashBuilder {\n            seed: seed,\n            ..self\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn stream(self, stream: u32) -> Self {\n        MyCoolHashBuilder {\n            stream: stream,\n            ..self\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl BuildHasher for MyCoolHashBuilder {\n    type Hasher = MyCoolHash;\n\n    fn build_hasher(&self) -> Self::Hasher {\n        MyCoolHash {\n            seed: self.seed,\n            stream: self.stream,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    use std::collections::HashMap;\n\n    let x = MyCoolHashBuilder::new().seed(42).stream(1);\n    HashMap::with_hasher(x);\n}\n```\n\nThere's two parts to the builder pattern - the interesting and unique _configuration_ and the actual _building_. The `HashMap` only cares about the building aspect, but there's no reason that the configuration couldn't follow the familiar configuration part. \n\nThe biggest downside I see is that I'd expect that most hashing is going to have a small number of knobs to tweak, which means the number of configuration methods would be small (or zero!).\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I had two reasons for preferring `with_build_hasher`. One was convention as you mentioned (which is important), and the other was that it gives a stronger indication of what you pass to the method. My first thought would be to assume that you pass an object that could hash stuff and could be reset to more stuff. `with_build_hasher` would help me learn more quilckly that it takes a factory. Of course the parameter type says the same thing, but it takes more effort to read a generic bound and you only see the method name when reading code.\n\nThen again, I agree that `with_hasher` sounds a lot better, so that might make it better.\n",
