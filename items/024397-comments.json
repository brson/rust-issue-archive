The best I came up with was:\n\n``` bat\nlessmsi x rust-foo.msi \\opt\\ && move \\opt\\SourceDir\\Rust \\opt\\rust && rmdir /s /q \\opt\\SourceDir\n```\n\nThis yields a Rust install rooted at `\\opt\\rust`.\n\nHowever now that rustup.rs exists, multiple targets aren't really an issue anymore. Someone should make a Chocolatey package for rustup.rs...\n",
