    "body": "There is something I don't understand about the example though: We explicitly specify that the lifetime of the `&T` must match the one of the `S` instance which contains it, and as Rust assures that, the destructor should be safe. After all, we specified that the reference to `T` needs to live at least as long as `S`. It seems the actual problem is that we didn't actually express that instance of `T` shall _outlive_ instance of `S` - as far as Rust is concerned, it only knows T must live as long as S, which might make the destructor a special case, as technically, an instance of `S` is about to decease.\n\nAfter all, it appears there might be a problem with either expressiveness of lifetimes, or with the way destructors are handled, which is exactly what you said :) : \"Right now the compiler's handling of lifetimes and destructors aren't quite sound in all cases.\". Good I arrived at the same conclusion.\n\nAnother concern of mine is also stated in #11406/#8861: there may be an inflationary use of `#![feature(unsafe_destructor)]` of people who don't really understand the implications (which includes me, usually). Therefore I hope this will be fixed until 1.0 is released to prevent `unsafe_destructor`s to pop up everywhere.\n",
