    "body": "@pcdinh Not exactly. Record types and struct types are different. Two record types can be considered the same if the names and types of all their fields are identical and in the same order (that is: they're structurally the same). A struct type has a name that's part of its identity in addition to its fields and types, and two struct types are only considered the same if they refer to the struct type with the same name.\n\nFor example, if you write `type Point = {x: int, y: int}; type Dot = {x: int, y: int};`, you can use values of type `Point` and `Dot` interchangeably. But if you write `struct Point {x: int, y: int} struct Dot {x: int, y: int}`, the compiler will complain if you use a `Dot` where a `Point` is expected, or vice versa.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for your clarification. What I read from Rust docs is that I am recommended to use structural type instead of record type because record expression and record types will be removed in a future version.\n\nhttp://static.rust-lang.org/doc/rust.html#record-expressions \n  \"Note: In future versions of Rust, record expressions and record types will be removed.\"\nhttp://static.rust-lang.org/doc/rust.html#record-types\n  \"Records are therefore deprecated and will be removed in future versions of Rust. Structure types should be used instead.\"\n\nTherefore I think that they are identical and can be used interchangeably. It turns out that they are different.\n",
