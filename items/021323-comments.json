I don't think this is a \"dramatical overhaul\", to use the words in the CC'd issue.\n\nI want to merge infrastructure changes (one to add `token::GenerateCompletion` and the other to add `ast::ExprCompletion`) as soon as possible. After that, I envision changes can be localized inside typeck. Other changes can wait and they are here basically to prove that the infrastructure works.\n\nAs for \"touches quite a lot\", because of exhaustive match _any_ change introducing a new AST node necessarily touches as much.

I have some experience with building code-completion engines and integrating them with editors, and going through the command line is a non-starter because it kills performance. You suffer the cost of process startup/teardown for every call, a serialization/deserialization roundtrip and most importantly, you lose the ability to cache the AST in memory for subsequent calls.\n\nThat last part is critical. If you have to parse the whole file (and parse/load imports) every time the user needs completions, your perf goes out the window.\n\nlibclang is a shining example of how to provide [a compiler API through a library](http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html). Not everything about that API is perfect, but Rust could do much worse than emulate it.\n\nAlso note that while clang internals change extremely rapidly, the API exposed by libclang is entirely stable and backwards compatible.\n",

I've seen plenty of semantic completion engines that offer only a command-line interface (to the detriment of their performance). Thank you for allaying my fears and thank you for working on this!\n\n@steveklabnik I created and have worked on [YCM](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) for the past 2 years. I have integrated several different completion engines into it (and wrote a few myself) and I've benchmarked all of them backwards and forwards, including several that didn't end up making the cut because of perf issues.\n\nProcess startup & termination eating up 23 ms of the latency budget is IMO unacceptable. On top of that, you get the overhead of serialization & desiralization through the command line (a big issue in pathological cases). That's without mentioning that this precludes the single most important perf-related feature a semantic completion engine can provide, and that's AST caching.\n\nSelecta merely filters strings and doesn't appear to do any language parsing or semantic analysis, which are the bulk of the time spent in a semantic completion engine. So bringing it up is comparing apples and oranges.\n",

There are doubts as to the specific strategy taken here, but more broadly this feature may want to be more fleshed out before landing in the compiler.\n\nWe think that the best way to move forward on this would be to write an RFC to gather feedback about implementation strategy which may provide insight as to when/where this should land.
