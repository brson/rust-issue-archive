However, before doing that work I've been focusing on\n#3511 because in order to do that we have to have a better definition\nof what the lifetime is for each value =). I'm not sure if we opened\na bug on that plan or if it was only discussed in the meeting.\n\nThere are a lot of RAII applications however that really rely on\nhaving more flexible destructors: for example, being able to acquire a\nlock and so on. If we cannot create more flexible destructors, we will\ncertainly require once fn support instead.\n",
