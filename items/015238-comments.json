At the moment we have it for (), (A, B), (A, B, C). I would like to remove them.\n\nWhy?\n\n> We are using String as key in the TreeMap representing a Json object. It would be better to use &str, but this would require to annotate lots of lifetimes. Is there any easy solution for this?\n\nIt's not feasible to use `&str`, as then a `Json` object isn't able to be freely passed around: it will require all the keys to be owned by something outside it, and so will be \"controlled\" by that object (e.g. it would not be (easily) possible to pass a `Json` object between tasks, or return it from the stack frame containing the \"key owner\").\n",

Do you think we should keep it?\n\nIts main purpose would be generic code, allowing `Json` to be used in the same manner as other things (e.g. the same reason that `&str` implements [`Str`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/master/std/str/trait.Str.html)).\n\n> Maybe we could implement this trait for longer tuples by using a macro. If you think this is a good idea I can give it a try (however, I don't know if I can do it with my current macro skills).\n\nThat would be the desirable approach.
