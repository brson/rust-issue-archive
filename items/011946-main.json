  "body": "Turns out this was a little more far-reaching than I thought it was.\n\nThe first commit is the crux of this stack of commits. The `io::io_error` condition is completely removed and the `read` and `write` methods are altered to return `IoResult<T>`. This turned out to be an incredibly far-reaching change!\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with how this turned out (in addition with the `unused_must_use` lint). I had to almost rewrite the pretty printer in `libsyntax` as well as the the formatting in `librustdoc` (as one would expect). These two modules do _tons_ of I/O, and I believe that it's definitely improved.\n\nThis pull request also introduces the `if_ok!()` macro for returning-early from something that returns a result. I made quite liberal use of this in mostly the pretty printer and html renderer, and I found its usage generally quite pleasant and convenient to have. I didn't really feel like adding any other macro while I was using it, and I figured that pretty printing could be nicer, but it's nowhere near horrid today.\n\nThis may be a controversial issue closing, but I'm going to say it.\n\nCloses #6163\n",
