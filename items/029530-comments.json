The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @Aatch (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis Regarding your question about the `def` and `module` fields of `NsDef`:\n\nWhen I was writing the first commit, I wasn't exactly sure what it meant when the `type_def` and `module_def` fields of a `TypeNsDef` were both `Some`, so I defined `NsDef` so that if it was representing what used to be a `TypeNsDef`, its `def` and `module` fields would mean the same thing as the `type_def` and `module_def` fields of the `TypeNsDef`. I gave the `def` field precedence in `NsDef::def()` (and hence in `Namebinding::def()`) since the `type_def` field was given precedence in `Namebindings::def_for_namespace()`.\n\nIt turns out the meaning of these fields is fairly complex.\n- If the `NsDef` is representing a value, struct, enum variant, or associated type definition with `Def` `d`, `def` is `Some(d)` and `module` is `None`.\n- If the `NsDef` is representing a (possible foreign) module definition `d`, `def` is `None` and `module` is `Some(mod)`, where `mod.kind` is `NormalModuleKind` and `mod.def_id` is `Some(d.def_id())`.\n- If the `NsDef` is representing an enum, trait, or type synonym definition `d`, `def` is `Some(d)` and `module` is `Some(mod)`, where `mod.kind` is `EnumModuleKind`, `TraitModuleKind`, or `TypeModuleKind` (respectively) and `mod.def_id` is `Some(d.def_id())`.\n- If the `NsDef` is representing a block, `def` is `None` and `module` is `Some(mod)`, where `mod.kind` is `AnonymousModuleKind` and `mod.def_id` is `None`.\n\nThe `kind` and `def_id` fields of `Module` are encoding slightly less information that the `Option<Def>` returned by `NsDef::def()` (if `kind` is `TypeModuleKind`, then the `Def` could be `DefTy(def_id, true)` or `DefTy(def_id, false))`, so at least in the case of a type synonym we need both the `def` and `module` fields to be `Some`.\n\nThis redundancy seems like a bad idea, so I refactored the `kind` and `def_id` fields of `Module` into a single field `def: Cell<Option<Def>>` (`kind` and `def_id` were `Cell<ModuleKind>` and `Cell<Option<DefId>>`, respectively) and changed `build_reduced_graph.rs` to only set the `module` field where it had previously set both fields.\n\nThus ideally exactly one of `def` and `module` are `Some` at any point and they can be refactored into something like `Result<Def, Rc<Module>>`.\n\nHowever, we sometimes allow `struct` and `mod` declarations to collide (see issue #21546 and merged PR #26421, which makes this a warning) due to an easily fixable bug in the duplicate checking code. When this happens, the `def` field corresponds to the `struct` declaration and the `module` field corresponds to the `mod` declaration, and we need both to preserve backward compatability.\n\nIt looks like it was decided that there would be one warning cycle before the warnings become errors. Once they are errors, I can refactor the `def` and `module` fields into something like `Result<Def, Rc<Module>>` very easily.\n\nThe warnings are currently in the beta branch. Does this mean they are ready to be made errors now in nightly? If so I could do that and refactor the fields in this PR.\n",

In any case, 4 weeks seems like a pretty reasonable span of time (for Nightly), but I don't think we've made a firm policy here.\n\nRegarding the crater run, perhaps `cargo test --no-run` might be of interest, there are certainly numerous ways that we could use crater to get more data (cc @brson). \n",
