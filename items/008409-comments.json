    "body": "Triage: I do think this is much better handled by having private fields with `unsafe` methods (which are more flexible anyway, e.g. it allows one to institute some safety checks, if desired):\n\n``` rust\nstruct Attribute<'a, S, T> {\n    priv context: &'a Context,\n    priv contents: gl::GLuint\n}\nimpl<'a, S, T> Attribute<'a, S, T> {\n    unsafe fn set_contents(&mut self, x: gl::GLuint) { self.contents = x }\n    // etc.\n}\n```\n\nA `macro_rules` macro for it might look something like:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! unsafe_fields {\n    (<$('$lifetime: ident, )* \n      $($param: ident),*>\n     $ty: ty: $( $field: ident: $field_ty: ty [$setter: ident] ),*) => {\n        impl<$($param)*> $ty {\n            $(\n                pub fn $field<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a $field_ty { &self.$field }\n                pub unsafe fn $setter(&mut self, x: $field_ty) {\n                    self.$field = x\n                }\n            )*\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nunsafe_fields! {\n    <'a, S, T> Attribute<'a, S, T>:\n    context: &'a Context [set_context],\n    contents: gl::GLuint [set_contents]\n}\n```\n\n(I guess one could even factor that macro to define the struct itself, so that the field names and types are not being repeated.)\n\nIn any case, I see this as a very rare use-case, I don't think it's worth extending the language; however, I have not written many low-level wrapper libraries like this, so I'm not sure _quite_ how painful it is.\n",
