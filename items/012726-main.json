  "body": "This version is slightly more up to date and is closer to the 3.5 that we're\nusing. This also updates the travis config to have a build matrix which tests\nrust against LLVM 3.3 and 3.4. For pull requests only LLVM 3.4 is tested to\nreduce the load on travis.\n\nThis is mostly just fluff, there's no real reason to gate rust on these results,\nit's more of just a nice thing to know when we break compatibility with LLVM 3.3\nand 3.4 (and eventually 3.5). This turns off notifications of failed commits\n(which are sent out for pushes to master).\n",
