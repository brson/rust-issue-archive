    "body": "It looks like this series leaves the native_name and abi in the AST, and the parser just immediately interprets the attributes. I would like to eliminate this duplication - things that are attributes should be metadata about the AST, not part of the AST itself.\n\nRemoving the native ABI from the AST looks involved (because the ABI is part of the function type), and we're probably going to want to make some changes to how native functions are handled before we take it out (specifically, make it not part of the function type), but I think we can remove native_name from the AST.\n\nCan you remove native_name and just have any code that cares look it up in the attribute list (as link_name), and then add a FIXME to the abi field of ast::native_mod referencing issue 1179?\n",
