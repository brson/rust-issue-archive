    "body": "\"Presumably the manual is the authority and the compiler is wrong to accept\" - HA! (Hint: Don't trust either)\n\nIn all seriousness... I don't think any of those examples can be seen as illegal. Confusing yes, but not wrong: You write a `'`, followed by one unicode codepoint, either directly embedded as utf8 or as escaped string, and close with another `'`.\n\nBecause it has to be exactly one codepoint, the parser has no problem with it being the same character used to delimit it, and because ASCII is a subset of utf8, both `\\n` and `\\r` are valid character values.\n",

    "body": "The ''' is a less clear case; I'm fine with whichever behavior as long as we make docs and compiler agree.\n\nOn the other hand, anyone using a literal newline like that deserves to be shot. Various transports used in the real world for code don't preserve line-endings: ftp, web services like pastebins, IRC, and anything using a \"text\" rather than \"binary\" mode in its I/O libs will corrupt literals of the 0x27 0x0a 0x27 or 0x27 0x0d 0x27 format, in some cases resulting in code that won't compile anymore (if it turns the sequence into 0x27 0x0d 0x0a 0x27), but in other cases _silently changing semantics_ by converting the 0x0d into 0x0a. Literals of that form also result in indentation violations, so na\u00efve auto-indent will also break said literals. Therefore, even though they are technically legal at present, it seems insane to leave it that way. Languages like C, Java, etc. similarly disallow unescaped 0x0a and 0x0d char literals.\n",
