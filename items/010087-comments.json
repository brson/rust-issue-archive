    "body": "Also: We definitely cannot obtain binary compliance currently on many platforms, even those that are not \"embedded\", without extensively patching our operations there, because there are platforms that have nonstandard behavior, even if it's just for the sole reason of \"their silicon literally predates the standard of IEEE754-2008\". So LLVM's problems are not necessarily the only gateway to pass.\r\n\r\nFor aarch64, x86-64, ppc64le, and a few other targets, this is comparatively minor as a concern.",
