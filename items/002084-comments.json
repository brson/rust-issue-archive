    "body": "In the HPC world (and at the other extreme end of performance, the embedded world) custom, proprietary compilers are often used \u2013 eg. the Intel and Portland C/C++ compilers. I can see Rust getting some use as a nice language to glue together existing code bases in C/C++, but users will still want the C/C++ compiler that produces the fastest code.\n\nOne other point - Rust's excellent compatibility with the C ABI means it can link easily with other languages that also make that effort. Fortran 2003's BIND(C) facility makes it trivial to provide a nice C interface to Fortran code, which would then also be callable/bindable by rust. A lot of the popular open source maths libraries \u2013 and a lot of science/physics code \u2013 are written in Fortran. As an example, numpy/scipy depend upon underlying Fortran libraries for matrix and vector operations.\n\n... so I'm not sure how far the idea of embedding compilers for \"other\" languages will take things. I suspect a lot of the time, people linking C code into a rust crate will produce a static archive and then link that with the rust code. Is it possible the C ABI (which a number of languages can emit code to be called across) is being conflated with C code itself?\n\nConscious that I might be making things overly complex here; if you think my examples here are too niche, fair enough.\n",
