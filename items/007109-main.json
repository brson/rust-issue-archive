  "body": "r? @brson\n\nlinks to issues: #7065 the race that's fixed; #7066 the perf improvement I added. There are also some minor cleanup commits here.\n\nTo measure the performance improvement from replacing the exclusive with an atomic uint, I edited the `msgsend-ring-rw-arcs` bench test to do a `write_downgrade` instead of just a `write`, so that it stressed the code paths that accessed `read_count`. (At first I was still using `write` and saw no performance difference whatsoever, whoooops.)\n\nThe bench test measures how long it takes to send 1,000,000 messages by using rwarcs to emulate pipes. I also measured the performance difference imposed by the fix to the `access_lock` race (which involves taking an extra semaphore in the `cond.wait()` path). The net result is that fixing the race imposes a 4% to 5% slowdown, but doing the atomic uint optimization gives a 6% to 8% speedup.\n\nNote that this speedup will be most visible in read- or downgrade-heavy workloads. If an RWARC's only users are writers, the optimization doesn't matter. All the same, I think this more than justifies the extra complexity I mentioned in #7066.\n\nThe raw numbers are:\n\n```\nwith xadd read count\n        before write_cond fix\n                4.18 to 4.26 us/message\n        with write_cond fix\n                4.35 to 4.39 us/message\n\nwith exclusive read count\n        before write_cond fix\n                4.41 to 4.47 us/message\n        with write_cond fix\n                4.65 to 4.76 us/message\n```\n",
