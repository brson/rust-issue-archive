    "body": "This seems to be taking issues like #12135 to the extreme by having a super-specialized implementation for _just strings_ on keys that generally want `Equiv`. I'm not sure that `Equiv` is the right interface for a `TreeMap`, and it's true that this is certainly solving a problem that cannot otherwise be done today.\n\nI would personally be more in favor of finding a better `TreeMap`-specific solution or sorting through the `Equiv` problem. For example, maybe a `TreeMap` could expose some form of binary search interface?\n\nFor previous discussion, see #13205, #11074, #11691, #12135, and #14968.\n",

    "body": "It seems I'm missing something, the essence of BST-nature is `Ord`, isn't it? It is impossible to avoid it, so the way to go must be changing what is compared.\n\nSo there could be a couple of cases:\n- wrapped data - when the same data is wrapped and to compare we have to strip it down to essence. It is the `Str` case\n- data with no \"internal\" similarities - in this case it the problem could be solved by mapping value to a type, which conforms to `Ord` and use it for comparison instead of original one (actually wrapped-data example above is just a special case when value is mapped to internal representation).  For example,\n\n```\ntrait ToFastHash {\n    fn to_fast_hash(&self) -> u64;\n}\n```\n\nor more general\n\n```\ntrait ToOrdValue<T:Ord> {\n    fn to_ord_value(&self) -> T;\n}\n```\n\nalthough I haven't tested yet if the second one will work in Rust now.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger, \n\n> These containers should just expose methods taking a closure instead of using the trait.\n\nYep, definitely this will work, but it actually addresses only the second part of \"Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible\". Consider the following examples:\n\n```\n/// Current way\n// key1, key2: String;\nlet mut t = TreeMap::new()\nt.insert(key1, 34);\nt.insert(key2, 45);\nlet v = t.find(&\"test\".to_string()); // Ohh, allocating?!\n\n/// Closures \n// key1, key2: String;\nlet mut t = TreeMap::new()\nt.insert(key1, 34);\nt.insert(key2, 45);\nlet v = t.find_with(|k| \"test\".cmp(&k.as_slice()); // Ohh, and that for every key to request?\n\n/// Proposed \n//  key1, key2: CustomType<Str>;\nlet mut t = TreeMap::new()\nt.insert(key1, 34);\nt.insert(key2, 45);\nlet v = t.find_equiv(&\"test\");\n```\n\nIt could be much easier if there was a way to return a closure, in this case it could be done as:\n\n```\n// str_eq<T:Str, V: Str>(s: &T) -> |v: &V| -> Ordering\nt.find_with(str_eq(\"test\"))\n```\n\nwhich is not that simple, but still is quite nice. But I've failed to get anything like this to work using current closures. Any hints are appreciated.\n\n> Special cases for certain primitives types is bad language design. A rope or small string type should be just as flexible, and anything preventing that is a bug.\n\nIt seems I wasn't clear. While I've mentioned `str` the code is actually about `Str`, which is just another trait. So if user's custom rope or small string type implements that trait (and it probably will if he wants it to co-operate with stdlib) - it just works. Again, it is all about stdlib, not about language.\n",
