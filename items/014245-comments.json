I'm not a python person, so I naturally chose to go with a proven Ruby project.\n\n> It is only used for the optional step of compiling documentation to PDF; the HTML documentation (including tutorials etc.) is build just using rustdoc. i.e. pandoc is not currently a hard dependency for building Rust-with-docs.\n\nGotcha. I tried working with a Ruby gem (C + Ruby) for Markdown, but it didn't work correctly with Rust (it didn't detect Rust as a language). Curated docs would only really be built by contributors or those wanting to contribute where as rustdoc would be used by library authors and the like.\n\nAdding more dependencies is definitely a serious concern.\n",

    "body": "> rust-lang.org uses it, it\u2019s not a blog.\n\n@adrientetar Simple static sites works fine with Jekyll < 2.0, but it wasn't meant for extensive documentation or other focuses.\n\nI'm a little hesitant about adding more functionality to rustdoc. It seems too much like rebuilding the wheel with no real gains (other than squashing some dependencies).\n\nOne solution would be to move to a Python system (like @huonw suggested) and use [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) for the curated docs, which I believe @chris-morgan has been advocating for it. There would be a few downsides:\n- Not markdown. Meaning it would add some inconsistencies in all the docs (api docs use markdown, but curated docs don't.)\n- Another stack to learn\n- Sphinx is a lot more complex (which provides some added functionality; like search, etc...) \n\nSphinx, however, is used by quite a lot of notable projects, including Julia's docs. It also offers the ability to generate PDF, HTML and ePub bundles without much pain. \n\nIt also does syntax highlighting to Pygments, which supports Rust, so that's all good. The only thing that needs to change is the validation (which currently works on Markdown code blocks), but Sphinx apparently has code validation built-in. I'm not sure if that allows it to pipe each code block to a specific process or what not, but I'll look into it.\n\nThoughts @alexcrichton @huonw or anyone else?\n",

    "body": "We will be rebuilding the wheel in some cases, but the wheel that we're rebuilding is normally quite simple. For example, markdown => html was a small wheel rebuilt via the glue we have to hoedown, but it was well worth our time because now we're able to parse, extract, colorize, and test code examples in rustdoc itself.\n\nI view this as pulling in more than just a dependency, but also adding a whole new system that has to be maintained across all our bots, all contributors checkouts, etc. I've found that everything is much much simpler if we're willing to write a bit more code to implement simple things like markdown => html generation (and others).\n\nI would prefer to explore how to leverage what rustdoc already gives (injection at the header and footer of every page) before exploring any solution written in either python or ruby. We shouldn't have a need for a full-blown static site generator, we're just serving up some simple documentation. We're also not moving to Sphinx at this time, we're sticking with Markdown.\n",
