    "body": "Yes, there are some dubious checks in various places.  I looked into fixing this.  I believe the best way is to (a) use wrappers around native functions and (b) translate native functions with dynamically sized return values so that they use an initial pointer as the return type.  This would fit well with the C convention of inserting silent structure arguments.  We should probably do the same for structure return types to cdecl functions; LLVM would probably do it for us, but that will yield a second copy.  Not sure how STDCALL functions handle this case.  \n",
