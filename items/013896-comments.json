    "body": "On another note, it also turns out that my attempt to allow you to encode all non-ASCII characters has a serious problem. HTML5 maps a bunch of characters from `0x80`-`0x9F` to other codepoints, which means there's no way to encode `U+0080` as an HTML entity that will decode back into `U+0080`.\n\n3 possible approaches:\n1. Redefine `EscapeAll` mode to not try and encode these characters. This means it is no longer guaranteed to produce ASCII output, which is unfortunate.\n2. Emit `&#xFFFD;` for these. If we can't round-trip, turning into `U+FFFD` may be the next best thing.\n3. Fail. And by that I mean return an `IoError` if one of these characters is encountered. That kind of sucks, though, and there's no way to customize the error (we'd have to use `OtherIoError` and put a textual description in the `desc` field).\n\nWe could also just get rid of `EscapeAll`, but it is potentially useful.\n\nIncidentally, in python, `\"\\x80\".encode(\"ascii\", \"xmlcharrefreplace\")` produces `&#128;`, but it's using XML rules instead of HTML5 rules.\n\n@seanmonstar Do you have any bright ideas here? Or know of any precedent where an HTML escaping library will escape non-ASCII characters (and what it does with e.g. `\"\\x80\"`)?\n",

    "body": "Regarding @kmcallister's html5 work, I'm hoping that, once that's ready, it should be able to take over the `libhtml` name. Hopefully it should not collide with the existing functionality here, but renaming some API as a `[breaking-change]` should be doable if necessary.\n\nWorst case, if we stabilize this for Rust 1.0 before html5 is ready, it could just become libhtml5. But hopefully if we get to the point of stabilizing this, we can discuss with @kmcallister any API renaming to be done to ensure we won't have a problem later.\n",

    "body": "@kmcallister I would be happy to work together on this stuff. I'm concerned that trying to port this existing libhtml PR on top of your existing work is, well, a lot of work. Besides the effort of porting it, this would also make it more difficult for you to modify that code if you determine that you need to make changes.\n\nUnless your html5 library is ready for merging in the very near future, my inclination is to say we should go ahead with this libhtml implementation of entity parsing as-is. As long as it conforms to the HTML5 entity parsing algorithm (and it was designed to do just that), we should be able to rewrite the existing API on top of your code at such time as html5 is ready to be merged without breaking any clients.\n\nSo I guess I have two questions for you about this PR that I would like you to comment on:\n1. Is the API ok? As in, can it be made to work with your code in the future? Note that I'm not marking this API as `#[stable]`, so we reserve the right to change it in the future. But the general approach here should be fine, I assume?\n2. Is the algorithm actually correct? I believe it is, and I have a limited test suite. The only pre-existing test suite I included was a port of the one from python's html library. I think that, plus the hand-written tests, exercises the library sufficiently to be comfortable saying it's correct.\n\nIf you're comfortable with the API, and you don't spot any obvious flaws with the algorithm, then my preference is to merge it as-is, and worry about porting it on top of your code later.\n",
