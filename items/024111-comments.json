    "body": "I don't doubt that `const fn` even in its current limited form would be useful functionality to have, but what I would really like, ideally before going further along this path, would be for those in favor of \"the `const fn` approach\" to think about and articulate their preferred endgame. If we just keep on incrementally adding useful-seeming functionality in the most obvious way, it seems very likely to me that we'll eventually end up copying more or less the entirety of C++'s `constexpr` design. Is that something we are comfortable with? Even if we say yes, I would much rather that we choose that path in a clear-eyed way, instead of backing into it with small steps over time, as the path of least resistance, until it has become inevitable.\n\n(Given that the semantics of safe Rust code should be fully definable, it seems likely that eventually at least every function which doesn't (transitively) depend on `unsafe` should be able to be marked as `const`. And given that `unsafe` is supposed to be an implementation detail, I bet people will push for somehow loosening that restriction as well. I would much rather we looked abroad and tried to find a more cohesive, capable, and well-integrated story for staging and type-level computation.)\n",

    "body": "@glaebhoerl \n\n> I don't doubt that const fn even in its current limited form would be useful functionality to have, but what I would really like, ideally before going further along this path, would be for those in favor of \"the const fn approach\" to think about and articulate their preferred endgame...it seems very likely to me that we'll eventually end up copying more or less the entirety of C++'s constexpr design.\n\nWhat I would personally like, even more than that, is that we have a fairly clear view on how we're going to implement it, and what portion of the language we are going to cover. That said, this is very closely related to support for associated constants or generics over integers in my mind.\n\n@eddyb and I did some sketching recently on a scheme which could enable constant evaluation of a very broad swath of code. Basically lowering all constants to MIR and intrepreting it (in some cases,\nabstract interpreting, if there are generics you cannot yet evaluate, which is where things get most interesting to me).\n\nHowever, while it seems like it would be fairly easy to support a very large fraction of the \"builtin language\", real code in practice hits up against the need to do memory allocation very quickly. In other words, you want to use `Vec` or some other container. And that's where this whole interpreting scheme starts to get more complicated to my mind.\n\nThat said, @glaebhoerl, I'd also love to hear you articulate **your** preferred alternative endgame. I think you sketched out some such thoughts in the `const fn` RFC, but I think it'd be good to hear it again, and in this context. :)\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis If I had one I would have mentioned it. :) I mainly just see known unknowns. The whole thing with `const`s as part of the generics system was of course part of what I understood as being the C++ design. As far as having associated `const`s and `const` generic parameters, considering that we already have fixed-size arrays with `const`s as part of their type and would like to abstract over them, I would be surprised if there were a much better -- as opposed to merely more general -- way of doing it. The `const fn` part of things feels more separable and variable. It's easy to imagine taking things further and having things like `const impl`s and `const Trait` bounds in generics, but I'm _sure_ there is prior art for this sort of general thing which has already figured things out and we should try to find it.\n\nOf the main use cases for the Rust language, the ones that primarily need low-level control, like kernels, seem reasonably well-served already, but another area where Rust could have lots of potential is things that primarily need high performance, and in that space powerful support (in some form) for staged computation (which `const fn` is already a very limited instance of) seems like it could be a game-changer. (Just in the last few weeks I came across [two](https://twitter.com/jamiiecb/status/681941669374201856) separate [tweets](https://twitter.com/BrandonBloom/status/687158027560984576) by people who decided to switch from Rust to a language with better staging capabilities.) I'm not sure if any of the existing solutions in languages \"close to us\" -- C++'s `constexpr`, D's ad-hoc CTFE, our procedural macros -- really feel inspiring and powerful/complete enough for this sort of thing. (Procedural macros seem like a good thing to have, but more for abstraction and DSLs, not as much for performance-oriented code generation.) \n\nAs for what _would_ be inspiring and good enough... I haven't seen it yet, and I'm not familiar enough with the whole space to know, precisely, where to look. Of course, per the above, we might want to at least glance at Julia and Terra, even if they seem like quite different languages from Rust in many ways. I know Oleg Kiselyov has done [a lot](http://okmij.org/ftp/meta-programming/) of interesting [work](http://okmij.org/ftp/meta-programming/HPC.html) in this area. Tiark Rompf's work on [Lancet](https://github.com/tiarkrompf/lancet) and [Lightweight Modular Staging](https://scala-lms.github.io/) for Scala seems definitely worth looking at. I recall seeing a presentation by @kmcallister at some point about what a dependently typed Rust might look like (which might at least be more general than sticking `const` everywhere), and I also recall seeing something from Oleg to the effect that types themselves are a form of staging (which feels natural considering the phase separation between compile- and runtime is a lot like stages)... lots of exciting potential connections in many different directions, which is why it'd feel like a missed opportunity if we were to just commit to the first solution which occurs to us. :)\n\n(This was just a braindump and I've almost surely imperfectly characterized many things.)\n",

I think there is big interest in Rust because it helps reduce the need for heap memory allocation. My code, in particular, makes a concrete effort to avoid heap allocation whenever possible.\n\nBeing able to do more than that would be _nice_ but being able to construct static instances of non-trivial types with compiler-enforced invariants is essential. The C++ `constexpr` approach is extremely limiting, but it is more than what I need for my use cases: I need to provide a function that can construct an instance of type `T` with parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` such that the function guarantees that `x`, `y`, and `z` are valid (e.g., `x < y && z > 0`), such that the result can be a `static` variable, without the use of initialization code that runs at startup.\n",

    "body": "> Given that the semantics of safe Rust code should be fully definable, it seems likely that eventually at least every function which doesn't (transitively) depend on `unsafe` should be able to be marked as `const`. And given that `unsafe` is supposed to be an implementation detail, I bet people will push for somehow loosening that restriction as well.\n\nJust a thought: if we ever formally define [Rust's memory model](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1447), then even `unsafe` code could potentially be safely and sensibly evaluated at compile-time by interpreting it abstractly/symbolically -- that is, use of raw pointers wouldn't turn into direct memory accesses like at runtime, but rather something (just as an example for illustration) like a lookup into a hashmap of allocated addresses, together with their types and values, or similar, with every step checked for validity -- so that any execution whose behavior is undefined would be _strictly_ a compiler-reported error, instead of a security vulnerability in `rustc`. (This might also be connected to the situation w.r.t. handling `isize` and `usize` at compile-time symbolically or in a platform-dependent way.)\n\nI'm not sure where that leaves us with respect to `const fn`. On the one hand, that would likely open up much more useful code to be available at compile time -- `Box`, `Vec`, `Rc`, anything using `unsafe` for performance optimization -- which is good. One arbitrary restriction fewer. On the other hand, the boundary for \"what can possibly be a `const fn`\" would now essentially be moved outwards to _anything that doesn't involve the FFI_. So what we'd _actually_ be tracking in the type system, under the guise of `const`ness, is what things (transitively) rely on the FFI and what things don't. And whether or not something uses the FFI is _still_ something that people rightfully consider to be an internal implementation detail, and this restriction (unlike `unsafe`) _really_ doesn't seem feasible to lift. And under this scenario you'd probably have far more `fn`s being eligible for `const`ness than ones which wouldn't.\n\nSo you'd still have `const`ness revolving around an arbitrary, implementation-exposing restriction, and you'd also end up having to write `const` almost everywhere. That doesn't sound too appealing either...\n",

I think this is just unnecessary verbosity. \n\nD doesn't have `const fn` but it allows any function to be called at compile time ( with some exceptions ).\n\nfor example\n\n```\n// Standalone example.\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nimpl Point {\n    fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Point {\n        Point { x: x, y: y }\n    }\n\n    fn add(self, other: Point) -> Point {\n        Point::new(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n    }\n}\n\nconst ORIGIN: Point = Point::new(0, 0); // works because 0, 0 are both known at compile time \nconst ORIGIN2: Point = Point::new(0, 0); // ditto\n\nconst ANOTHER: Point = ORIGIN.add(ORIGIN2); // works because ORIGIN and ORIGIN2 are both const.\n{\n    let x: i32 = 42;\n    let y: i32 = 24;\n    const SOME_POINT: Point = Point::new(x, y); // Error: x and y are not known at compile time\n}\n{\n    const x: i32 = 42;\n    const y: i32 = 24;\n    const SOME_POINT: Point = Point::new(x, y); // Works x and y are both known at compile time.\n}\n```\n\nNote, I am not really a Rust user and I have only read the RFC a few minutes ago, so it is possible that I might have misunderstood something.\n",

I don't think it would be confusing.\r\n\r\nI am flip flopping on this idea. It has its benefits (*only* think about `const fn` when making public interface decisions) but I thought of another way it could be confusing:\r\n\r\n> Your public interface is protected since you can't make a function not-const that is called by a `const fn`\r\n\r\nThis is true, and unfortunately it would imply that when a library author marks a public function `const`, then they are implicitly marking all functions transitively called by that function `const` as well, and there's a chance they're unintentionally marking functions they don't want to, thus preventing them from re-writing those internal functions using non-const features in the future.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> I expect there to be way more `const fn` than the other way around.\r\n\r\nI thought this way for a while, but it will only be true for pure Rust library crates. It won't be possible to make FFI-based fns const (even if they're only transitively FFI-based, which is a lot of stuff), so the sheer amount of `const fn` may not be *quite* as bad as you and I thought.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMy current conclusion: Any non-explicit `const fn` seems problematic. There might just not be a good way to avoid writing the keyword a lot.",

It is plausible that if we are going to endure the pain of adding in an effect system, we may want to consider some syntax that we can scale to other sorts of effects. As an example, we're paying a similar price with `unsafe` (also an effect), though I'm not sure that it makes sense to think about unifying those.\r\n\r\nThe fact that violations may occur dynamically seems like even more reason to make this opt-in though, no?",

    "body": "I have a question/comment about how this could be used in certain trait/impl situations. Hypothetically, let's say we have a math library with a `Zero` trait:\r\n\r\n```\r\npub trait Zero {\r\n    fn zero () -> Self;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis trait does not require the `zero` method to be `const`, as this would prevent it from being impled by some `BigInt` type backed by a `Vec`. But for machine scalars and other simple types, it would be far more practical if the method *were* `const`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimpl Zero for i32 {\r\n    const fn zero () -> i32 { 0 } // const\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Zero for BigInt {\r\n    fn zero () -> BigInt { ... } // not const\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe trait does not *require* that the method be `const`, but it should still be allowed, as `const` is adding a restriction to the implementation and not ignoring one. This prevents having a normal version and a `const` version of the same function for some types. What I'm wondering is has this already been addressed?",

All in all, this is probably the easiest to implement in a compiler as it adds the least complexity to the language.\r\n\r\nBut if we could add `const` to an implemented method where it is not required, we can avoid this duplication, although still not perfectly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimpl<T: Zero> Zero for Vector2<T> {\r\n    const fn zero () -> Vector2<T> {\r\n        Vector2 { x: T::zero(), y: T::zero() }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIIRC, C++ allows something like this when working with `constexpr`. The downside here is that this `const` would only be applicable if `<T as Zero>::zero` is also `const`. Should this be an error, or should the compiler ignore this `const` when it is not applicable (like C++)?\r\n\r\nNeither of these examples tackle the problem perfectly, but I can't really think of a better way.\r\n\r\nEdit: @andersk's suggestion would make the first example possible without errors. This would probably be the best/simplest solution as far as compiler implementation goes.",

It's probably necessary to allow truly const behavior:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nconst fn dont_change_anything(&self) -> bool {\r\n    let old = self.cell.get();\r\n    self.cell.set(!old);\r\n    old\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far I've seen that `set` is not `const`. The question is whether this will stay forever. In other words: Can `unsafe` code rely that when running the same `const` function on immutable data will always return the same result today and in every future release of the language/library?",

I don\u2019t know if there are specific concerns or just general caution, but IIRC this is why per-function feature gates were added. I imagine the concerns for these two would be similar enough that they could share a FCP. I don\u2019t know if @rustbot can handle separate FCPs in the same GitHub thread, so it\u2019s probably better to open separate issues.",

    "body": "`mem::uninitialized` is absolutely a footgun, one that shoots through your hands as well if aimed improperly. Seriously, I cannot overstate how incredibly dangerous the use of this function can be, despite its marking as `unsafe`. \r\n\r\nThe motivation behind declaring these additional functions `const` stems from the nature of these functions, as calling `mem::uninitialized<Vec<u32>>` will return the same result every time, with no side-effects. Obviously if left uninitialized, this is a terrible thing to do. Hence, the `unsafe` is still present.\r\n\r\nBut for a use-case, consider a global timer, one that tracks the start of some function. It's internal state will be determined at a later time, but we need a way to present it as a static global struct created on execution.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n\r\nuse std::time::Instant;\r\n\r\npub struct GlobalTimer {\r\n    time: UnsafeCell<Instant>\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl TimeManager {\r\n    pub const fn init() -> TimeManager {\r\n        TimeManager {\r\n            time: UnsafeCell::new(Instant::now())\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code doesn't compile, due to `Instant::now()` not being a `const` function. Replacing `Instant::now()` with `mem::uninitialized::<Instant>())` would fix this problem if `mem::uninitialized` was a `const fn`. Ideally, the developer will initialize this structure once the program starts execution. And while this code is considered un-idiomatic rust (global state is generally very bad), this is just one of many cases where global static structures are useful.\r\n\r\nI think [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/7ju75d/miri_was_merged_into_rustc/dr96wys/) gives a good foundation for the future of Rust code being run at compile-time. Global, compile-time static structures are a feature with some important use-cases (OS's also come to mind) that rust is currently missing. Small steps can be made towards this goal by think slowly adding `const` to library functions deemed suitable, such as `mem::uninitialized` and `mem::zeroed`, despite their `unsafe` markings.\r\n\r\nEdit: Forgot the `const` in function signature of `TimeManager::init()`",

In that world, it might make sense to get rid of `const` keyword altogether: almost everything can be `const`, and one will have to go out of one's way to change a function from const to non-const, so backwards compatability hazards about inferred constness probably wouldn't be terribly high.\r\n\r\n2. However, getting rid of `const` *today* is not feasible. Today's miri can't interpret *everything*, and it is not really thoroughly tested in production.\r\n\r\n3. It is actually backwards compatible to require `const` today, and then deprecate this keyword and swtich to inferred constness in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\nPutting 1, 2 and 3 together, it seems a nice option to stabilize `const` keyword today, than expand the set of constant-evaluatable functions in future releses. After some time, we will have a thoroughly battle-tested ~~hony badger~~ constant evaluator, which can evaluate everything. At that point, we can switch to inferred const. ",

    "body": "I think explicit const fn can be annoying and clutter many APIs however I think the alternative of implicitly assuming has way too many issues to be practicable:\r\n\r\n- Throwing away side effects can lead to code behaving differently (say write and then read a file) if it's called const or non const.\r\n- Calling extern functions means there can always be side effects, so unsafe code could probably never be inferred const fn.\r\n- When can const fn be inferred for generic code? Would this be done at monomorphization time?\r\n\r\nHowever I really see the biggest problem in not making it explicit being that someone can accidentally break lots of code with a single change without even being aware of it. This is especially of concern with the long dependency graphs common in the Rust ecosystem. If it requires an explicit change to the function signature one will be aware of this being a breaking change more easily.\r\n\r\nMaybe such a feature could be implemented as a crate level config flag that can be added at the root of the crate, `#![infer_const_fn]` or something like that, and stay opt-in forever. If the flag is added const fn would be inferred where possible in the crate and also reflected in the docs (and it would require that the called functions are const fn too), if a crate author adds this flag they sort of pledge to be cautious about versioning and maybe rust-semverver could even be forced.",

    "body": "[Section 3.3 of Kenton Varda's \"Singletons considered harmful\" writeup](http://www.object-oriented-security.org/lets-argue/singletons#TOC-What-about-debug-logging-) seems relevant here (honestly, the whole thing is well worth reading).\r\n\r\n> ## What about debug logging?\r\n>\r\n> In practice, everyone acknowledges that debug logging should be available to every piece of code.  We make an exception for it.  The exact theoretical basis for this exception, for those who care, can be provided in a few ways.\r\n>\r\n> From a security standpoint, debug logging is a benign singleton.  It cannot be used as a communication channel because it is write-only.  And it is clearly impossible to cause any sort of damage by writing to a debug log, since debug logging is not a factor in the program's correctness.  Even if a malicious module \"spams\" the log, messages from that module can easily be filtered out, since debug logs normally identify exactly what module produced each message (sometimes they even provide a stack trace).  Therefore, there is no problem with providing it.\r\n>\r\n> Analogous arguments can be made to show that debug logging does not harm readability, testability, or maintainability.\r\n>\r\n> Another theoretical justification for debug logging says that the debug log function is really just a no-op that happens to be observed by the debugger.  When no debugger is running, the function does nothing.  Debugging in general obviously breaks the entire object-capability model, but it is also obviously a privileged operation.",

    "body": "My statement about \"we can figure out a solution [for debugging]\" was indeed referring to a potential future API, that is callable from consts, but has some form of printing. Randomly implementing platform specific print operations (just so we can make existing code with print/debug statements be const) is not something that a const evaluator should do. This would be purely opt in, explicitly not having  different observable behaviour (e.g. warnings in const eval and command line/file output at runtime).

That is, most of the code which actually implements `const fn` is already working hard in the stable compiler (disclaimer: this is something I've heard from @oli-obk, I might have heared wrong).\r\n\r\n* embedded working group wants const fn badly :)\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, note that *not* stabilizing `const fn` leads to proliferation of sub optimal API in the libraries, because they have to use tricks like `ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT`  to work around lack of const fns.

If that's not possible, there's a hard error. In all other contexts, the `const` part does not matter at all.\r\n\r\nExamples of such contexts that require `const fn` are array lengths. You can write `[i32; 15]`. You can also write `[i32; 3+4]` because the compiler can compute the `7`. You cannot write `[i32; read_something_from_network()]`, because how would that make any sense? With this proposal, you CAN write `[i32; foo(15)]` *if* `foo` is `const fn`, which makes sure it is more like addition and less like accessing the network.\r\n\r\nThis is *not at all* about code that may or will run when the program runs. There is no \"maybe evaluate at compile-time\". There is just \"have to evaluate at compile-time or abort compilation\".\r\n\r\nPlease also read the RFC: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0911-const-fn.md",

Let's summarize:\r\n\r\nthe rfcbot comment is https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111#issuecomment-376649804\r\n\r\nCurrent concerns\r\n\r\n* This is not a priority, and the 2018 release has put enough onto our plates already\r\n* We start marking everything `const`, which is annoying\r\n* Is this the design we want to commit to?\r\n\r\nI can't really talk about the priority thing + fallout concern, except that `const fn` has baked in nightly a long long time\r\n\r\nThe other two points are closely related. @eddyb's design (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111#issuecomment-376829588 as I understood it) is to not have `const fn`, but instead have a `#[const]` attribute that you can slap onto stuff:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[const]\r\nmod foo {\r\n    pub fn square(i: i32) -> i32 { i * i }\r\n}\r\n#[const]\r\nfn bar(s: &str) -> &str i{ s }\r\n#[const]\r\nfn boo() -> fn(u32) -> u32 { meh }\r\nfn meh(u: u32) -> u32 { u + 1 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand that recursively goes into whatever is marked with it, so any function inside a `#[const]` module is a `#[const] fn`. A function declared inside a `#[const] fn` is also a `#[const] fn`.\r\n\r\nThis lowers the number of annotations needed, as some crates will just slap a `#![const]` in the `lib.rs` and be done with it.\r\n\r\nIssues I see with that design (but those issues also often exist in `const fn`):\r\n\r\n* might require opt-out support, because you might want to be able to declare some few non-const functions deep inside an otherwise `#[const]` module tree.\r\n* are function pointers to `#[const] fn` in argument/return type position required to be `#[const] fn`?\r\n    * again, opt-out would be necessary\r\n\r\nWe do need to think about these things, so we don't design a system that will be incompatible with a future version where we want to be able to call functions through function pointers during a const eval.",

These changes do affect the outcome of the operation, even if the actual difference is slight.\r\n\r\nFusing operations (I assume you refer to mul-add) is not allowed/not done without fast-math flags precisely because it changes the rounding of results. LLVM is very careful to preserve the exact semantics of floating point operations when targeting IEEE compliant hardware, within the limits sets by the \"default floating point environment\".\r\n\r\nTwo things that LLVM doesn't try to preserve are NaN payloads and signallingness of NaNs, because both of those can't be observed in the default fp environment -- only by inspecting the floats' bits, which we would therefore need to prohibit. (And even if LLVM was more careful about those, hardware varies in its treatment of NaN payloads as well, so you can't pin this on LLVM.)\r\n\r\nThe other major case I know of where the compiler's decision can make a difference for floating point results is the location of spills and reloads in *x87* (pre-SSE) code. And this is mostly an issue because x87 by default rounds to 80 bit for intermediate results and rounds to 32 or 64 bit on stores. Properly setting the rounding mode before each FPU instruction to achieve correctly rounded results is possible, but it's not really practical and so (I believe) LLVM doesn't support it.",

CTFE. By this I mean that a referentially transparent `const fn` mechanism would not be able to evaluate as much at compile time as a non-ref-transparent `const fn` scheme could. From those that propose not sticking with referential transparency, I'd ask that they provide as much concrete use cases as they can against this proposition so that we may evaluate the trade-offs.",

    "body": "> So if we really want referential transparency, we need to make sure we do not allow (in safe code, at least) things that can cause runtime non-determinism even if they're fine under miri.\r\n\r\nSo the goal here is to guarantee that a `const fn` is deterministic and side-effect free at run-time *even if miri would error out about it during execution*, at least if the `const fn` is entire safe code? I never considered that to be important, TBH. It's a pretty strong requirement, and indeed we would at least have to make ptr-to-int and [float-to-bits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/primitive.f32.html#method.to_bits) unsafe then, which will be hard to explain. OTOH, we should then also make raw pointer comparison unsafe and I'd be happy about that :D \r\n\r\nWhat is the motivation for this? Seems like we're trying to re-introduce purity and an effect system, which are things Rust once had and lost, presumably because they did not carry their weight (EDIT: or because it just wasn't flexible enough to do all the different things people wanted to use it for, see https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-April/003926.html).",

Safety is not the issue here, so unsafe is totally the wrong keyword imo. This is just surprising behaviour that we're totally catching at compile time eval. You can already do this in normal functions, so no surprises there. Const fn is about marking existing functions as evaluable at compile time without affecting runtime. It's not about purity, at least that's the vibe I got when ppl talk about the \"pure hell\" (I wasn't around, so I might be misinterpreting)",

That is, given:\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nreverse :: [a] -> [a]\r\nreverse []       = []\r\nreverse (x : xs) = reverse xs ++ [x]\r\n\r\nputStrLn :: String -> IO ()\r\ngetLine :: IO String\r\n\r\nmain :: IO ()\r\nmain = do\r\n    line <- getLine\r\n    let revLine = reverse line\r\n    putStrLn revLine\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou know that the result of `revLine` in `let revLine = reverse line` can only depend on the state passed into `reverse` which is `line`. This provides reasoning benefits and clean separation.\r\n\r\nI wonder what the effect system back then looked like... I think we need one given `const fn`, `async fn`, etc. anyways to do it cleanly and get code reuse (something https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2237 but with some changes...) and parametricity seems like a good idea for that.\r\n\r\nIn the immortal words of Phil Wadler and Conor McBride:\r\n\r\n> Shall I be pure or impure?\r\n> \u2014Philip Wadler [60]\r\n>\r\n>We say \u2018Yes.\u2019: purity is a choice to make locally\r\n\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09259.pdf\r\n\r\n@oli-obk \r\n\r\nI do not envy the person that has to document this surprising behavior that the result of execution can differ for `const fn` if executed at runtime or at compile time given the same arguments.\r\n\r\nAs a conservative option, I propose that we delay the decision on referential transparency / purity by stabilizing `const fn` as referentially transparent, making it `unsafe` (or non-`const`) to violate it, but we don't actually guarantee referential transparency, so people can't assume it either.\r\n\r\nAt a later time, when we've gained experience, we can then make the decision.\r\nGaining experience includes people trying to make use of the non-determinism but failing, and then reporting it and telling us about their use cases.",

    "body": "@Centril \r\n> I do not envy the person that has to document this surprising behavior that the result of execution can differ for const fn if executed at runtime or at compile time given the same arguments.\r\n\r\nThe `even` you wrote above would fail if executed at CTFE time because it inspects the bits of a pointer. (Though actually we can deterministically say that this is even because of alignment, and if the evenness test is done via bit operations, \"full miri\" would do that properly. But let's assume you are testing the entire least significant byte, not just the last bit.)\r\nThe case we are talking about here is a function that *errors* with an interpreter error at compile-time, but succeeds at run-time. The difference is in whether the function even completes execution. I don't think that's hard to explain.\r\n\r\nI agree that *if CTFE succeeds with a result*, then the run-time version of the function should also be guaranteed to succeed with the same result. But that's a much weaker guarantee than what we are talking about here, is it not?\r\n\r\n@oli-obk \r\n> I agree, let's do the conservative thing now. so we don't make these unsafe, but unstable. this way the libstd can use it, but we can later decide on the details.\r\n\r\nI lost context, what is \"these\" here?\r\n\r\nRight now, luckily, CTFE miri just outright refuses to do anything with pointer values -- arithmetic, comparison, everything errors. This is a check done at CTFE time based on the values actually used in the computation, it cannot be circumvented by unions and anyway the code that would be needed to do the arithmetic/comparison just *doesn't exist*. Hence I am pretty sure that we satisfy the guarantee I stated above.\r\n\r\nI could imagine problems if we had CTFE return a pointer value, but how would a compile-time-computed pointer value even make any sense anywhere? I assume we already check whatever miri computes to not contain pointer values because we have to turn it into bits?\r\n\r\nWe could carefully add operations to CTFE miri, and in fact all we need for @eddyb's offset_of [1] is pointer subtraction. That code exists in \"full miri\", and it only succeeds if both pointers are inside the same allocation, which is sufficient to maintain the guarantee above. What would not work is the `assert` that @eddyb added as a safeguard.\r\nWe could also allow bit operations on pointer values if the operations only affect the aligned part of the pointer, that's still deterministic and the code actually already exists in \"full miri\".\r\n\r\nEDIT: [1] For reference, I am referring to his macro in [this thread](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2421) that we cannot link to because it was marked off-topic, so here's a copy:\r\n```rust\r\nmacro_rules! offset_of {\r\n    ($Struct:path, $field:ident) => ({\r\n        // Using a separate function to minimize unhygienic hazards\r\n        // (e.g. unsafety of #[repr(packed)] field borrows).\r\n        // Uncomment `const` when `const fn`s can juggle pointers.\r\n        /*const*/ fn offset() -> usize {\r\n            let u = $crate::mem::MaybeUninit::<$Struct>::uninit();\r\n            // Use pattern-matching to avoid accidentally going through Deref.\r\n            let &$Struct { $field: ref f, .. } = unsafe { &*u.as_ptr() };\r\n            let o = (f as *const _ as usize).wrapping_sub(&u as *const _ as usize);\r\n            // Triple check that we are within `u` still.\r\n            assert!((0..=$crate::mem::size_of_val(&u)).contains(&o));\r\n            o\r\n        }\r\n        offset()\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT2: Actually, he also posted it [here](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/discussion-on-offset-of/7440/4?u=ralfjung).",

    "body": "> So a function called with arguments at run time is only guaranteed purity if it actually terminates if evaluated at compile time with the same arguments?\r\n\r\nYes, that's what I am proposing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThinking about it some more (and reading @oli-obk's reply that appeared while I was writing this), I get the feeling that you want is an *additional* guarantee along the lines of \"a safe `const fn` will not error at CTFE time (other than panics) when called with valid arguments\". Some kind of \"const safety\" guarantee. Together with the guarantee I stated above about successful CTFE coinciding with run-time behavior, that would provide a guarantee that a safe `const fn` will be deterministic at run-time, because it matches the successful CTFE execution.\r\n\r\nI agree that's a harder guarantee to obtain. For better or worse, Rust has various safe operations that CTFE miri cannot guarantee to always execute successfully while maintaining determinism, like the variant of @Centril's `oracle` that tests the least significant byte for being 0. From the perspective of CTFE in this setting, the \"valid values of type `usize`\" constitute *only* values that are `PrimVal::Bytes`, while a `PrimVal::Ptr` should not be allowed [1]. It's like we have a slightly different type system in const context -- I am not proposing we change what miri does, I am proposing we change what the various Rust types \"mean\" when attached to a `const fn`. Such a type system would guarantee that all the safe arithmetic and bit operations cannot go wrong in CTFE: For CTFE-valid inputs, integer subtraction can never fail in CTFE because both sides are `PrimVal::Bytes`. Of course, ptr-to-int has to be an unsafe operation in this setting because its return value has type `usize` but is not a CTFE-valid `usize`.\r\n\r\nIf this is a guarantee we care about, it does not seem unreasonable to me to make the type system more strict when checking CTFE functions; after all, we want to use it to do more things (checking \"const safety\"). I think it would make a lot of sense, then, to declare ptr-to-int casts `unsafe` in `const` context, arguing that this is needed because the `const` context makes additional guarantees.\r\n\r\nJust like our normal \"runtime safety\" can be subverted by unsafe code, so can \"const safety\", and that's fine. I don't see any problems with unsafe code being able to still do ptr-to-int casts via unions -- that's *unsafe code*, after all. In this world, the proof obligations for unsafe code in a const context are stronger than the ones in a non-const context; if your function returns an integer you have to prove that this will always be a `PrimVal::Bytes` and never be a `PrimVal::Ptr`.\r\n\r\n@eddyb's macro would need an unsafe block, but it would still be safe to use because it only makes use of these \"const unsafe features\" (ptr-to-usize and then substracting the result, or just using the pointer subtraction intrinsic directly) in a way that is guaranteed not to raise a CTFE error.\r\n\r\nThe cost of such a system would be that a safe higher-order `const fn` must take a `const fn` closure to be able to guarantee that executing the closure will not, itself, violate \"const safety\". Such is the price of actually obtaining proper guarantees about safe `const fn`.\r\n\r\n[1] I am fully ignoring floats here as I don't know much about where the non-determinism would arise. Can someone provide an example for floating point code that would behave differently at CTFE time than at run-time? Would it be sufficient to e.g. make miri error out if, when doing a floating point operation, one of the operands is a signalling NaN (to obtain the first guarantee, the one from my previous post), and to say that the CTFE type system does not allow signalling NaNs at type `f32`/`f64` (to obtain \"const safety\")?",

I think I could live with a version of raw pointer comparison that errors out if either pointer is not currently dereferencable in the sense of being within an allocated object (but that's not what \"full miri\" currently implements). However, that would *still* make `is_eq` not \"const safe\" because if `T` is zero-sized, it could point one past the end of an object even if we only consider safe code.\r\n\r\nC++ allows comparing pointers one past the end to yield an indeterminate (think: nondeterministic) result. Both C and C++ allow comparing a dangling pointer to yield an indeterminate result. It's not clear what LLVM guarantees but I'd rather not bet on guarantees that exceed what they have to guarantee for C/C++ (the weaker of the two, if they differ). This is a problem if we want to guarantee run-time determinism for everything that successfully executes in CTFE, which I think we do.",

I think you understood the CTFE soundness guarantee I was describing and you agree it is a guarantee we want; whether it is *all* we want is up for discussion :)\r\n\r\n> OK; You lost me; I don't see how you arrived at this \"safe const fn is deterministic\" guarantee given the two premises; could you elaborate on the reasoning?\r\n\r\nLet's say we have some call to `foo(x)` where `foo` is a safe const function and `x` is a const-valid value (i.e., it is not `&y as *const _ as usize`). Then we know that `foo(x)` will execute in CTFE without raising an error, by const safety. As a consequence, by CTFE soundness, at run-time `foo(x)` will behave the same way it did in CTFE.\r\n\r\nEssentially I think I decomposed your guarantee into two pieces -- one ensuring that a safe const fn will never attempt to do something that CTFE does not support (like reading from stdin, or determining whether the least significant byte of a pointer is 0), and one ensuring that whatever CTFE *does* support matches runtime.\r\n\r\n> These paragraphs are music to my ears! heart This does seem to ensure determinism (\"purity\")? and is precisely the thing I had in mind earlier. I think const safety is also a terrific term!\r\n\r\nGlad you like it. :)  This means I finally understand what we are talking about here. \"purity\" can mean so many different things, I often feel a little uneasy when the term is used. And determinism is *not* a sufficient condition for const safety, the relevant criterion is whether execution in CTFE raises an error. (One example of a deterministc non-const-safe function is my variant of your `orcale` multiplied by 0. This is not okay to do even using unsafe code as miri will error out when inspecting the bytes of a pointer, *even if* the bytes ultimately do not matter. It's like the operation that extracts the least significant byte of a pointer is \"const-UB\" and hence not allowed even in unsafe const code.)",

    "body": "@RalfJung \r\n\r\n> The cost of such a system would be that a safe higher-order `const fn` must take a const fn closure to be able to guarantee that executing the closure will not, itself, violate \"const safety\". Such is the price of actually obtaining proper guarantees about safe `const fn`.\r\n\r\nI believe this can be severely mitigated to support transforming most existing code by introducing `?const` where you can write higher order functions whose result can be bound to a `const` if and only if the function provided is `?const fn(T) -> U` and where `is_const(x : T)`; So you have:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n?const fn twice(fun: ?const fn(u8) -> u8) { fun(fun(42)) }\r\n\r\nfn id_impure(x: u8) -> u8 { x }\r\nconst fn id_const(x: u8) -> u8 { x }\r\n?const fn id_maybe_const(x: u8) -> u8 { x }\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let a = twice(id_impure); // OK!\r\n    const b = twice(id_impure); // ERR!\r\n    let c = twice(id_const); // OK!\r\n    const d = twice(id_const); // OK!\r\n    let e = twice(id_maybe_const); // OK!\r\n    const f = twice(id_maybe_const); // OK!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll write up an RFC proposing something to this effect (and more) in a week or so.",

So, if you obscure the code enough such that the compiler does not see any more where the addresses come from, you can tell that the comparison evaluates to `true`. The C++ standard hence allows both results to occur nondeterministically, justifying both the optimization (which says `false`) and the compilation to assembly (which says `true`).

Any other unsafe code needs to go through other unsafe const fns or const intrinsics, which require their own discussion wrt stabilization.",

CTFE will follow IEEE exactly, but LLVM/hardware might not.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to `const` items, but those will never be runtime-executed -- whereas `const fn` might be. So it seems prudent to not stabilize FP operations in `const fn`.\r\n\r\nOTOH, we already promote results of FP operations? So there we already have that run-time/compile-time mismatch observable on stable. Would it be worth a crater run to see if we can undo that?",

    "body": "@RalfJung I'm still not convinced that e.g. spilling and then loading it back into the FPU registers in between some operations gives the same results as the same computation without that spilling.\r\n\r\n> From what I recall, basic arithmetic is not even all that problematic (except on 32bit x86 because x87...), but transcendental functions are.\r\n\r\nHow would transcendental functions mean a problem?\r\n\r\nIIRC, while some transcendental functions are supported by common x86 processors, those functions are slow and eschewed, and only included for completeness and compatibility with existing implementations. Thus, almost everywhere, transcendental functions are expressed in terms of combinations of basic arithmetic functions. This means that there's no difference in their referential transparency to that of arithmetic functions. If basic functions are \"safe\" then anything built on them is, including transcendental functions. The only source of \"referential intransparency\" here might be different approximations (implementations) of those transcendental functions in terms of those basic arithmetic functions. Is that the source of the problem?",

    "body": "@remexre `const fn` acts as an interface specification. I'm not very acquainted with the tiny details of this feature (and maybe what follows here is already thought out), but two cases where I can think of the compiler telling when a function is incorrectly anotated as `const` is to fail compilation if such function takes a `&mut` as a parameter or if it calls other non-`const` functions. So if you change the implementation of a `const fn` and you break those restraints, the compiler will stop you. Then you can choose to implement the non-`const` bits in (a) separate function(s) or break the API if that was an intended change.\r\n\r\nThere's another middle point that I haven't seen discussed about and it's the possibility to introduce an opposite of this marker and some sort of \"function purity inference\" when it's not explicitly set. Then the docs would show the actual marker but with some sort of warning about not guaranteeing the stability of that marker if it's a `const`. The problem is that this might encourage being lazy and doing this almost every time, which is not its purpose.",

    "body": "I've been resisting commenting here, and maybe we should move this conversation to a thread on internals (is there one already?) but...\r\n\r\nThe decision to close this makes no sense to me. It's a tracking issue, because it shows up in error messages from the compiler, and it's not alone, see this post for some more examples: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/psa-tracking-for-gated-language-features/2887. Closing this issue to me implies stability, which is obviously not yet the case.\r\n\r\nI frankly can't see an argument for closing this... I'm glad more targeted issue now exist, so implementation can move forward, with hopefully new discussion and focus, but I don't see a clear way to associate the compiler messages with those.\r\n\r\nAgain, if this needs (or already has) a thread on internals maybe let's move this conversation there?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Or is the issue just that the book is outdated? Trying the example from the RFC (it's missing a couple `#[derive(...)]`s) seems to work without errors on Rust rustc 1.31.1. Are there still compiler error message pointing here? It would be nice to have a place to link errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: only int, `bool` and `char` operations are stable in const fn\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want to have them linked to the specific issues that would be an improvement possibly.",
