  "body": "The pipes compiler produced data types that encoded efficient and safe\nbounded message passing protocols between two endpoints. It was also\ncapable of producing unbounded protocols.\n\nIt was useful research but was arguably done before its proper time.\n\nI am removing it for the following reasons:\n- In practice we used it only for producing the `oneshot` protcol  and\n  the unbounded `stream` protocol and all communication in Rust use those.\n- The interface between the proto! macro and the standard library\n  has a large surface area and was difficult to maintain through\n  language and library changes.\n- It is now written in an old dialect of Rust and generates code\n  which would likely be considered non-idiomatic.\n- Both the compiler and the runtime are difficult to understand,\n  and likewise the relationship between the generated code and\n  the library is hard to understand. Debugging is difficult.\n- The new scheduler implements `stream` and `oneshot` by hand\n  in a way that will be significantly easier to maintain.\n\nThis shouldn't be taken as an indication that 'channel protocols'\nfor Rust are not worth pursuing again in the future.\n\nConcerned parties may include: @graydon, @pcwalton, @eholk, @bblum\n\nThe most likely candidates for closing are #7666, #3018, #3020, #7021, #7667, #7303, #3658, #3295.\n",
