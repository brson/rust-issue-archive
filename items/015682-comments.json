    "body": "@jbclements It's likely! My understanding of the system is shallow :)\n\n@huonw The nested case is an issue I hadn't considered, I guess a better suggestion would be to introduce `$self` to be allowed (not in conflict with the keyword), and to refer to outer self?:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! call_foo {\n    ($e:expr) => { $self.foo($e) }\n}\n```\n\nWhere: Any macro that uses `$self`, taints the entire macro to require that all patterns will have an implicit `$self:` prepended. Macros can be used in the form `x.y.z.call_foo!(some_expr)` would expand to `call_foo!(x.y.z: some_expr)` which would allow a contextual self, and `call_foo!(..)` with no dot would expand to `call_foo!(self: ..)`.\n\nWould this suffice for hygiene since `self` = `$self` for inputs?. \nIn your nested example, this should then error out as parent self shouldn't be accessible. It should also error out if the inner body referenced `$self` as `$self` != `(inner)self`? \nThese macros would fail to expand within a function, but resolve would already error for that, similar to the current error message with its weird static method error.\n",

    "body": "Is it safe to say this issue has been left aside because the solution @Ryman suggested is very hard to implement?\n\nI'd like to make a case for the initial 'just allow self' implementation. The implementation is likely one or two small conditionals in the linter, and it will enable a whole class of macros that are now blocked pending this bug.\n\nSubsequently we can immediately file a bug that there is a case where nested implementations cause a problem. This more rare bug can then have a more focused discussion on how to fix it. Even if then it's decided that we should make it $self, it won't be a big problem for macro library authors to add the '$' to their macros when this more complex feature is implemented.\n",
