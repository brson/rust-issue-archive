    "body": "Effectively all of our precedent here is for using terse, typically single-letter, generic type names. If we're going to start moving away from that, I think this needs some discussion instead of just doing the replacement in `Treemap`.\n\nPersonally, it seems obvious from context that `K` and `V` represent the key and value type. But I understand the desire for more descriptive names. If we are going to start making this change, I'd rather see an example of a type where the renaming actually has an obvious increase in readability, as opposed to a mapping type where `K`/`V` are already widely-understood.\n",

In a lot of ways I sent this pull request to gauge opinion as much as to have the change accepted.\n\nHashMap is probably a better example, since I've seen a bunch of people confused about the `H` parameter and `S` in `Hasher<S>`.

But I've found in practice that when I use long names for generic parameters, the code becomes paradoxically _less_ readable to me. Perhaps it's because I can't distinguish concrete from generic types. Maybe a convention like `KEY` and `VALUE` would help. I don't know.\n\nAlso, I tend to agree that `T`, `U`, `V` (or `A` and `B`) for \"any old type\" or \"element of some container\" is more-or-less ideal, and readability is not improved by using `TYPE`.\n",

When type parameters have long names, it can be very difficult (especially without any navigation support from IDE/editor) to find out what some type is.\n\nThere is a precedence for adopting a convention for long names for type parameters in [Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org/) language, and IMO it looks ugly and does not add readability at all.\n\nMoreover, this is only a \"problem\" when you read the code. When you use a trait/struct, for example, from standard library, using only its API docs as a reference, it is not a problem at all, because type parameters should be explained in the docs anyway.\n",
