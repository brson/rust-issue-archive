  "body": "This is a hack, but I don't think we can do much better as long as `derive` is running at the syntax expansion phase.\n\nIf the `custom_derive` feature gate is enabled, this works with user-defined traits and syntax extensions. Without the gate, you can't use e.g. `#[derive_Clone]` directly, so this does not change the stable language.\n\nTo make this effective, we now check gated attributes both before and after macro expansion. This uncovered a number of tests that were missing feature gates.\n\nThis PR also cleans up the deriving code somewhat, and forbids some previously-meaningless attribute syntax. For this reason it's technically a\n\n```\n[breaking-change]\n```\n\nr? @sfackler \n",
