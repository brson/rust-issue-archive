    "body": "re-r? @brson \n\nI've now discovered that there are multiple formats for archives (or at least various tweaks on flavors). The known formats (at least by LLVM) [are these](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/89a5e2532d8284fe01992acd1e96b6fce4ffffb8/include/llvm/Object/Archive.h#L178-L183), and our current revision of LLVM can only emit archives in the GNU format. [Support has been added](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commit/b13e877e27d6b85f598a8a95b746acafcfb26710) very recently for BSD formats (what I believe OSX uses), but it's not present in our LLVM version currently and we can't upgrade due to some assorted test failures.\n\nI updated this to add an `archive_format` field to target specifications. Right now a value of \"gnu\" (which linux-like targets and MinGW all use) indicates that LLVM should be used, otherwise we fall back to the system `ar` tool. I'm hoping we can over time pull all targets into using LLVM so we don't have any lagging behind.\n",
