    "body": "The https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-getting-started page that @Lenny222 links to dates back to before we had releases, so the directions given there are how to build from git, not how to install a release.  Now that we have releases, I think it makes sense to distinguish between installation instructions for developers and installation instructions for users.  That page should therefore probably be in the \"Notes\" section of the wiki (for developers) and not the \"Doc\" section (for users).  I'll file a separate bug for that.\n\nAside from that, it's true that there's redundancy between the compilation instructions in the tutorial and those in INSTALL.txt, but I don't think it's a big problem (unless the instructions disagree, of course).\n",
