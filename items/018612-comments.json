    "body": "I don't think that this is a bug. The implementation of `get_type_id()` looks like:\n\n``` rust\nimpl<T: 'static> Any for T {                             \n    // ...\n}                                                        \n```\n\nThe point of note being that any type ascribing to `'static` has the method `get_type_id()`. In your example you're not calling the `get_type_id()` on the `Any` object, you're actually calling `get_type_id` for `Box<Any>`. If you print out the type id of `Box<Any + Send>` you'll see it's the same as `err.get_type_id()`.\n",

    "body": "You're quite correct.  In the example, `(*err).get_type_id()` returns a TypeId that matches the one for `&str`.\n\nWell, I feel a bit of an idiot.  It never occurred to me that `Box<Any>` also satisfied the impl for `Any`.  I don't know if this suggests the documentation could use a note about this, or if I'm just especially thick.  Just for posterity, I was coming at this from the perspective of: \"I have a `Box<Any>` that I got from a task failure, now how do I use it?\"\n\nClosing the issue since PEBKAC.\n",
