As I mentioned to @japaric on IRC, I think we can expand to `match <iterator> { mut iter => ... }` instead of `{ let mut iter = <iterator>; .. }` to resolve the matter of temporary lifetimes.\n2. Personally, I prefer to do this expansion than to have for loops in the AST that typeck/borrowck/everybody-else has to deal with. Basically desugaring makes the rest of the compiler simpler. However, the catch would be if it negatively affects error messages and so forth. So I'm curious @japaric as to the impact there. There is also the problem of our inability to really name things in std reliably, though this is ameliorated by the fact that `#![no_std]` is not stable yet.\n",

If error messages become a problem you could use a similar scheme to what they do with Pyret where you provide a tag (either in some table or directly on the AST) for which rewrite rule you used, and then utilize that information when reporting errors by re-sugaring it then pretty printing. I would be happy to help explore such a scheme if the error reporting suffers.\n",

    "body": "@japaric and I were talking on IRC. My feeling is that the error in this example:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    for\n        &1i8\n//~^  old-ERROR refutable pattern in `for` loop binding\n//~^^ new-ERROR non-exhaustive patterns: `Some(&_)` not covered\n        in [1i8].iter() {}\n}\n```\n\nis actually better. I doubt most \"lay people\" know what a \"refutable pattern\" is. (I personally have to work out from first principles which is \"irrefutable\" and which is \"refutable\".) But having a concrete counter example seems immediately understandable. It might be better still to combine the two messages:\n\n```\n\"refutable pattern in `for` loop binding: `Some(&_)` not covered\"\n```\n",

    "body": "> Why not directly access the core crate?\n\nIf you mean expanding to `::core::iter::IntoIterator`, that won't work in most cases, since most crates are linked to `std` but not to `core` (they have access to `core` stuff because of re-exports).\n\n> The RFC didn't mention this \"mod std\" business, and I'm a bit uncomfortable with it.\n\nYou already have to use the `mod std` to use the `#[derive]` syntax extension and/or slicing syntax in `#![no_std]` crates. At the moment this required for stuff that's implemented in the frontend, but we'd definitely like to improve this situation in the future.\n",
