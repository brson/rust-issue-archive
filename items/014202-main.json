  "body": "Passing `--pretty=flowgraph` makes rustc print a control flow graph.\n\nIn practice, you will also need to pass the additional options:\n- `-o <FILE>` to emit output to a `.dot` file for graphviz, and\n- `--pretty-node=<ID>` to specify the node-id for the block you want to print.\n\n(You can only print the flow-graph for a particular block in the AST.)\n\nThese changes do not generalize the rest of the pretty-printer to\nsupport the `--pretty-node=<ID>` option for printing subtrees of the\nAST, but that is obviously a potential future feature that we could\nadd on.  It is orthogonal to flow-graph printing, though.\n",
