  "body": "Previously an `unsafe` block created by the compiler (like those in the\nformatting macros) would be \"ignored\" if surrounded by `unsafe`, that\nis, the internal unsafety would be being legitimised by the external\nblock:\n\n```\nunsafe { println!(\"...\") } =(expansion)=> unsafe { ... unsafe { ... } }\n```\n\nAnd the code in the inner block would be using the outer block, making\nit considered used (and the inner one considered unused).\n\nThis patch forces the compiler to create a new unsafe context for\ncompiler generated blocks, so that their internal unsafety doesn't\nescape to external blocks.\n\nFixes #12418.\n",
