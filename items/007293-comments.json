    "body": "My apologies. I tried to teach bors to cope with transient github API failures a little better yesterday. Clearly the cure was worse than the disease. I've reverted that change.\n\nUnfortunately because github is _so_ flaky on the API side, the larger the pull request queue gets, the more likely github will return a failure at some point during a single bors run. At 39 entries in the queue, it happens every couple of runs (i.e. we're only getting a \"complete\" bors-step run every 6 or 9 minutes).\n\nI will try a different failure-coping strategy on monday. Meanwhile I've cancelled all builds and reverted the previous attempt in bors' logic. I'll let it run \"normally\" over the weekend.\n\nSorry.\n",
