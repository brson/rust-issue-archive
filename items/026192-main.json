  "body": "This commit shards the all-encompassing `core`, `std_misc`, `collections`, and `alloc` features into finer-grained components that are much more easily opted into and tracked. This reflects the effort to push forward current unstable APIs to either stabilization or removal. Keeping track of unstable features on a much more fine-grained basis will enable the library subteam to quickly analyze a feature and help prioritize internally about what APIs should be stabilized.\n\nA few assorted APIs were deprecated along the way, but otherwise this change is just changing the feature name associated with each API. Soon we will have a dashboard for keeping track of all the unstable APIs in the standard library, and I'll also start making issues for each unstable API after performing a first-pass for stabilization.\n",
