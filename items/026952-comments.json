The file that is causing the issues is https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow/blob/master/src/progress/broadcast.rs, and though it doesn't seem to use `Extend` or `extend` directly, it used to (so, the issue might be similar).\n\nIf I misunderstand what you mean by \"code to poke around with\", let me know. I don't have a smaller reproduction, in that keeping things building on stable means not breaking them by ripping out lines, but I'm happy to try and help.\n",

    "body": "More data on when this broke:\n\nA coworker has a stale nightly, rustc 1.3.0-nightly (faa04a8b9 2015-06-30), which builds the git pull just fine. I'll see about getting a build against the crates.io version (his project isn't compatible with 0.0.6, but a new project that just loads the timely crate explodes). \n\nMy version, 1.3.0-nightly (16f64c388 2015-07-09) explodes on the git pull and crates.io's timely 0.0.6 (which is older than the git pull). \n\nCrater with 1.3.0-nightly (2015-07-10) explodes on crates.io's timely 0.0.6. I suspect it would break on the git drop too. \n\nThis may help narrow down when the regression dropped in. I think multirust can pull down specific nightlies, so I may just do a few more of those.\n",
