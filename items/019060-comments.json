    "body": "This was primarily motivated by @SimonSapin's frustration with the ergonomics of getting a by-value iterator over a [u8]. They proposed an explicit by-value iterator, but I suggested this design as more useful and composable.\n\nSo now you can do `let x = [1,2,3,4]; let y = x.iter().cloned()` to get a by-value iterator of the refs. I didn't really dig into their usecase. If you control the iterator's usage, you can always do `for &y in x.iter()`, so the only place I see this useful is when you need to pass a by-value iterator somewhere else. One example I guess would be `x.iter().cloned().collect()`. \n\nI honestly expected this to be discussed more before being merged! (hence my note of \"If this isn't desirable, it can be taken out of the PR\")\n",

It's more a question of doing it generically over `Deref`, which is somewhat unusual. Let me give it some more thought/experimentation.
