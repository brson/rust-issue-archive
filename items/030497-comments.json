    "body": "The crucial thing here is the semicolon after your statement. A block consists of a bunch of statements, terminated with semicolons, possibly followed by an expression, which is _not_ terminated by a semicolon. Therefore, putting the semicolon after `rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101)` made the compiler view the expression as a statement, with no terminating expression on the block. If you leave off the semicolon, it should work:\n\n``` rust\nfn generate_secret_number() -> u32 {\n    rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101)\n}\n```\n\nNote the lack of a semicolon. I hope that helps!\n\n---\n\nThis bug might still be useful as a documentation bug - the long explaination for `E0269` does not mention this pitfall, while it seems like a common case that should be addressed.\n",
