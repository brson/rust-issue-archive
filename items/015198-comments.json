    "body": "This is an example of the problem that [RFC 550](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0550-macro-future-proofing.md) was meant to prevent, which indeed it does:\n\n```\n<anon>:2:6: 2:21 error: `$condition:expr` is followed by `$action:block`, which is not allowed for `expr` fragments\n<anon>:2     ($condition:expr $action:block) => ({})\n              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n```\n\nThe ambiguity between struct initializers and blocks is a long-standing wart of the expression grammar.  It's probably responsible for other bugs, but it should again not cause macro breakage like this, thanks to RFC 550.\n",
