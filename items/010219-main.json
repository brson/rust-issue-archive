  "body": "This commit changes drop glue generated for structs to use the invoke LLVM\ninstruction instead of call. What this means is that if the user destructor\ntriggers an unwinding, then the fields of the struct will still ge dropped.\n\nThis is not an attempt to support failing while failing, as that's mostly a\nproblem of runtime support. This is more of an issue of soundness in making sure\nthat destructors are appropriately run. The test included fails before this\ncommit, and only has one call to fail!(), yet it doesn't destroy its struct\nfields.\n",
