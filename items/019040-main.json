  "body": "This commit applies the stabilization of std::fmt as outlined in [RFC 380](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0380-stabilize-std-fmt.md).\nThere are a number of breaking changes as a part of this commit which will need\nto be handled to migrated old code:\n- A number of formatting traits have been removed: String, Bool, Char, Unsigned,\n  Signed, and Float. It is recommended to instead use Show wherever possible or\n  to use adaptor structs to implement other methods of formatting.\n- The format specifier for Boolean has changed from `t` to `b`.\n- The enum `FormatError` has been renamed to `Error` as well as becoming a unit\n  struct instead of an enum. The `WriteError` variant no longer exists.\n- The `format_args_method!` macro has been removed with no replacement. Alter\n  code to use the `format_args!` macro instead.\n- The public fields of a `Formatter` have become read-only with no replacement.\n  Use a new formatting string to alter the formatting flags in combination with\n  the `write!` macro. The fields can be accessed through accessor methods on the\n  `Formatter` structure.\n\nOther than these breaking changes, the contents of std::fmt should now also all\ncontain stability markers. Most of them are still #[unstable] or #[experimental]\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nCloses #18904\n",
