  "body": "Currently we don't emit lifetime end markers when translating the\nunwinding code. I omitted that when I added the support for lifetime\nintrinsics, because I initially made the mistake of just returning true\nin clean_on_unwind(). That caused almost all calls to be translated as\ninvokes, leading to quite awful results.\n\nTo correctly emit the lifetime end markers, we must differentiate\nbetween cleanup that requires unwinding and such cleanup that just wants\nto emit code during unwinding.\n",
