    "body": "A single-pass `SipHash` implementation is indeed faster than the stateful implementation used by Rust, but it's not an enormous improvement. Rust's hash table is faster than the libstdc++/libc++ `unordered_map` when using a C++ (no asm or SIMD intrinsics) single-pass `SipHash` implementation because linear open addressing is a good fit for a strong hash function.\n\n`SipHash` fundamentally requires a 60-120 cycle (on x86_64) setup time, and then provides a hashing rate of ~2 cycles per byte (maybe you can do better with asm and SIMD intrinsics). This is tolerable for _long_ strings, because it's only twice as slow as good hash functions without the same guarantees. For integers and short strings, the setup time is a _huge_ expense.\n\nI'm sure that a hash function can exist for small fixed-size keys with far better performance and the same security guarantees, and we may be able to find a weak block cipher to use for this. It will of course still be slower than using the identity function as the hash like C++ standard library implementations all seem to do (with a few extra bit operations in the table itself while matching it to a bucket).\n",

    "body": "@thestinger I think we're talking about the same thing: preventing collision attacks, right?\n\nTaking V8 as an example, it uses what looks like a Jenkins hash derivative (the inner loop is two adds, two shifts and a xor) with a randomized initial value.  It doesn't give quite the same guarantees as SipHash but the tradeoff is that it's much faster.  Is an approach like that acceptable?\n\nApropos random numbers, I noticed that each hash map is created with a new random seed.  Has anyone measured what happens when you generate the random seed once instead of repeatedly?\n",
