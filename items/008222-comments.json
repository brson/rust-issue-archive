    "body": "I think I prefer not to do this, for a few reasons:\n- If it exists at all, I'd like it to be called `enable-icu` since `enable-unicode` suggests (incorrectly) that the developer doesn't get unicode functionality at all without it. All text in Rust is unicode.\n- There are no non-ICU libraries that can fill the place here. At least none liberally licensed. All other full unicode implementations are either LGPL or proprietary (that I can find)\n- Our theory is that libextra is, eventually, going to consist of a curated selection of packages from the broader rustpkg ecosystem. Consequently it may well be necessary to enable building with or without nearly _every_ component we include a reference to, since users may not wish to bundle-together things they are not using. So I think special-casing the libicu bindings is a bit premature.\n\nLeaving this open to solicit further discussion: if you have strong opinions on this, let me know here.\n",

    "body": "@graydon Well, I almost agree with you, but I put my first thought below.\n\n`--enable-icu` vs `--enable-unicode`: you are absolutely right since there is only the ICU binding for now.\n\nLicensing: I thought backends using platforms' API might useful for anyone who wants to reduce external dependencies. A backend using `std::unicode` might also be useful until `extra::unicode` provides a superset of `std::unicode` features. For now, `extra::unicode::*` is a _subset_ of std one AFAIK. (also useful for bootstraping when any code depends on `extra::unicode`?)\n\nlibextra and rustpkg ecosystem: I'm so excited and happy with your direction. However, I thought maintaining stable public APIs and ABIs with separated backends will be able to provide Unicode-aware libraries without forcing users to bundle ICU into their programs.\n\nPerhaps my understanding is different from the goal of `extra::unicode`.\n",
