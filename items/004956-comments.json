    "body": "Yes, that's what I was thinking. Now that I'm looking at it though, maybe it's not necessary to put all that logic into core. \nWe could instead redefine `IpAddr` to not depend on uv's `sockaddr_in` and `sockaddr_in6` types, create conversions between it and the uv types, put `IpAddr` into core, and leave at least some of the logic in uv. It sort of depends on how much functionality uv is giving us here, how difficult it is to reproduce, and how much extra code will be required in core.\n\nEither way, the determination of what I/O code lives where is something we can revisit later, so we don't need to worry too much about making the wrong decision here. The most important thing is that [the abstract I/O types](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/5022) in core can mention IP addresses without depending on libuv.\n",
