From what I can see, the path is reached like so:\n\n```\nTestHarnessGenerator::fold_crate\n             |\n       mk_test_module\n             |\n          mk_tests\n             |\n       mk_test_descs\n             |\n   mk_test_desc_and_fn_rec\n```\n\nAnd the only way that `mk_test_desc_and_fn_rec` is called is if there's more than one item in `cx.testfns`.  The only way THAT happens is if the `Folder` hits the test function [here](https://github.com/andrew-d/rust/blob/andrew-fix-test-reexports/src/librustc/front/test.rs#L130).  If that function is hit, then the conditional [here](https://github.com/andrew-d/rust/blob/andrew-fix-test-reexports/src/librustc/front/test.rs#L174) can't be false, and we should always hit the assignment.\n\nAll that being said: another pair of eyes would be welcome :laughing: \n",
