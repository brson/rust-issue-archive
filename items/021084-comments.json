    "body": "This is actually covered by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20445 as the plan is to remove `allow(unstable)` altogether in favor of naming selective features that you would like to opt in to. For example most programs would today have `#![feature(io, path)]` to allow usage of the `std::io` and `std::path` modules (a significant number of the warnings today). The general idea is that with that stability attribute infrastructure programs can selectively opt-in to features on a case-by-case basis instead of blanket allowing all unstable features.\n\nThe warnings today can generally be categorized into \"expected instability\" and \"unexpected instability\". We expect warnings on usage of the `io` module, for example, but we do _not_ expect warnings on the usage of `.to_string()`. We would like to be notified about APIs that we need to stabilize during the beta cycle, and the warnings are meant to serve as a catalyst for that.\n\nI think regardless though I'm going to close this in favor of #20445 as it will largely become obsolete after that.\n",
