    "body": "@ytinasni We don't currently have a notion of an illegal path. There are paths that perhaps don't parse the way you expect, but the only way to actually throw an error is if your path contains non-utf8 (on Windows) or NUL. I don't think it's appropriate to make e.g. \"C:a\\b\" throw an error.\n\nGiven that, we need to figure out some way to parse \"C:a\" that makes sense. We could just interpret it as \"C:\\a\", although that strikes me as less than ideal.\n",

    "body": "The summary of the situation appears to be that drive-relative paths are now in fact down to the level of \"broken Windows feature\", functioning as it did in the days of long ago in some places, not functioning at all in others and implemented brokenly in others. (Thanks for the clarifications there, @ytinasni.)\n\nMy own experience (mostly only up to XP) has been that most things work with drive-relative paths, but not quite all (mostly those things that would be doing their own path management rather than using native APIs directly). On a nearby Windows 7 machine with lots of tools on it from the mid '90s, I just tried the GNU `ls` that was present on it (hmm, from 1997/fileutils 3.16; perhaps this isn't a valuable anecdote after all)\u2014it works just fine with drive-relative paths, just like `dir` would (with the curious exception that it couldn't cope with `E:`, claiming \"no such file or directory\", while `E:.` or such things would work fine\u2014and of the same set of tools, `rm -r E:` had worked fine!). `7za` 4.42, from 2006: given a command like `7za a E:home.gif.zip E:home.gif` it started writing `E:\\blunt\\home.gif.zip` as it should but then complained that it couldn't find `E:home.gif`\u2014so it gets partial marks only. Those are my two readily available pieces of evidence.\n\n@liigo _We do not care_ whether people \"should\" or \"should not\" use such things: that is not our domain unless we do rigorous validation of absolutely everything in it at great expense\u2014a model that was tried earlier, weighed in the balances and found wanting for various reasons. What we care about is what behaviour we use when we _do_ encounter such paths, which we inevitably will. Please be careful about taking solely from your own experiences and declaring from that alone that a feature is bad and should not be used\u2014especially when designing libraries, one must necessarily be liberal in what one accepts. Also, [as noted](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11579#issuecomment-32702916) by @kballard, reverting this patch alone is not an option; we must do _something_, one way or another, consistently throughout `std::path::windows`.\n\n@kballard I am of the opinion that the behaviour that we now have is entirely acceptable and most likely to be what is desired by most users.\n",
