I don't think this is a strictly backwards-compatible change though (in terms of coherence) because I could have `impl Read for Cursor<MyType>` locally I believe and this would start not compiling if `MyType` implemented `AsRef<[u8]>`. I'm currently running a crater run to see if this actually causes any breakage in practice.\n\nUnfortunately this also doesn't enable things like `Cursor<Box<[u8]>>` because the `AsRef` trait isn't implemented for many smart pointers (and I think we ran into trouble doing so).\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Ah the `Box` thing is annoying. On the other hand we are already having `impl<'a, T, U> AsRef<U> for &'a T where T: AsRef<U> + ?Sized, U: ?Sized` (which is causing this regression I guess), so it would be natural to have the same forward implementation for smart pointers.\n\n@aturon As I already elaborated in  #23364, my main motivation was to enable the usage of `Box<[T]>`, `Arc<[T]>` etc. Initially I used `Deref` for that but it was brought up that `AsRef` is the more natural trait to do that as it also covers fixed-sized arrays (currently only up to a length of 32 though :( ). Thus a follow-up PR would have been the [implementation of `AsRef` for `Box` and friends](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/forward-implement-traits-on-smart-pointers-make-smart-pointers-more-transparent/2380/3). I didn\u2019t get any feedback on this thread so I just went ahead.\n\nAs it appears now, this is not so trivial but we are also in the unfortunate situation that it is currently impossible to write generic code over `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>` and `SmartPointer<[u8]>`. Afaik the first two types were part of the motivation to introduce `AsRef` in the first place.\n",
