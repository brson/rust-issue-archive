Personally, I'd like to see a kind of long-term vision for `NonZero`-like functionality that can eventually be stabilized -- I know @Gankro has some thoughts about that that don't involve stabilizing `NonZero` itself -- and I'd rather not slowly accumulate unstable functionality without such clarity. For example, the `Zeroable` trait itself has never gone through an RFC process or been fully vetted by the libs team.\n\n@Gankro, IIRC your ideas about `NonZero` related to `Unique` and `Shared`. Is that right, and if so, how soon do you anticipate producing RFCs for those?\n",
