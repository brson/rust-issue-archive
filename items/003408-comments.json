Add an `any` type, which could be useful for exception handling code patterns, such as (1.).\n\nThe value passed to `fail!` is currently constrained to being a `~str`, but that is (or at least should be) orthogonal to the description provided in (1).\n\nI would prefer that the two topics be kept separate, especially since the meta-data on this issue (like \"E-Easy\") probably only applies if it is focused on (1) alone, and not (2) as well.\n",

Maybe just have them receive a enum variant `LinkedFailure` or so.\n\nAlso, I still need to figure out how to adapt the `Any` trait to allow things like `to_str()` for the containing type without copying all code I have written for it.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to pass my notes along.\n",
