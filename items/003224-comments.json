    "body": "There are two reasons this is happening:\n1. The parser treats patterns on the LHS of a `let` differently from `match` patterns. It considers `let`-LHS patterns irrefutable, and `match` patterns to be always refutable. The parser makes all bindings by-value if the pattern is refutable. So what this code is doing is copying the _contents_ of the unique box even though the initialization is by-move.\n2. The kind checker isn't aware of this, and doesn't check that the RHS is copyable when the statement initializer is `<-`. That's okay when the pattern is just an ident or `_`, but not okay if the pattern contains any by-copy bindings.\n\nIf I recall correctly, we were going to get rid of `<-`, so that would be one solution. Another is for the kind checker to be more precise. A third solution is for the parser to treat `let` patterns the same way as `match` patterns, but I'm not totally sure what effect that would have. Obviously, pending changes to pattern semantics as described in #3271 affect all of this.\n",

So many linearity bugs, who can keep them all straight?\n\nI suppose @catamorphism that you are correct, we could allow you to move and then take a ref binding.  This is sort of moving the value into a temporary, taking a ref into the temporary, and then letting the temp get cleaned up.  Anyway, this gets to the matter of rvalue lifetimes, which I realize I should have also put on the 0.5 priorities.  Bah.\n",

    "body": "@lifthrasiir posted a snippet to #rust where an irrefutable &-pattern (originally in a closure parameter) caused a non-copyable value to be silently copied (... originally causing an SDL surface to be destroyed early). It reduces to something like\n\n```\nstruct X { v: int }\n\nimpl Drop for X {\n    fn finalize(&self) { io::println(fmt!(\"%?\", ptr::to_uint(self))); }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = X { v: 42 };\n    let &y = &x;\n}\n```\n\nwhich runs the finalizer twice with different output. Is that the same issue?\n\nNote that with `match &x { &y => () };` instead of the second `let` line, it errors with \"by-move pattern bindings may not occur behind @ or & bindings\" whereas `x` isn't moved here at all.\n",

    "body": "@catamorphism and @nikomatsakis: I'm debating about nominating this for a maturity milestone.  In particular, the fact that there has been:\n- discussion about what bug the code is actually exposing, and,\n- discussion about what one should and should not be able to do, and\n- large changes to the language itself that removed the original test case from the language\n\nhas made me wonder if this is a candidate for \"Maturity Milestone 1: well defined\", in the sense that we should specify the interactions of moves/linearity and finalization (that's milestone 1), and write a stable regression test for this example (which might more appropriately belong with  milestone 2: backwards compatible).\n\nBut I thought I would bring the topic up here first, rather than waiting until the triage meeting and potentially bogging it down for more minutes than this issue warrants.\n",
