The existing scheme is:\n\n```\nRUST_LOG=<module_prefix>[=<log_level>],<module_prefix>[=<log_level>],...`\n```\n\nThere are ways we could improve this:\n- Symbolic log levels, not just numbers\n- Removing the longest-match logic in module-name matching (I don't actually understand what it's doing presently)\n- Interpreting an (ambiguous) bareword that matches a symbolic log level name as the log level applied to every module, rather than a module name set to the default log level\n\nYou pretty much never want `all`. It logs a lot. Really a lot. Every malloc, every task switch, every character peeked-at while parsing..\n",

    "body": "So the proposal is to use the following pseudo-BNF to match the contents of `RUST_LOG`:\n\n```\nLogSpec ::== 'help' | LogLevel (',' Module)*\nLogLevel ::== Error | Warning | Info | Debug\nError ::== 'e' | 'er' | 'err' | 'erro' | 'error' | 'errors'\nWarning ::== 'w' | 'wa' | 'war' | 'warn' | 'warni' | 'warnin' | 'warning' | 'warnings'\nInfo ::== 'i' | 'in' | 'inf' | 'info'\nDebug ::== 'd' | 'de' | 'deb' | 'debu' | 'debug'\nModule ::== AbsoluteModule | ModuleFragment\nAbsoluteModule ::== ('::' Identifier)+\nModuleFragment ::== Identifier ('::' Identifier)*\nIdentifier ::== [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\n```\n\nThe semantics are as follows:\n- Specifying a log level alone turns on log messages for that level and up (so e.g. `warn` turns on errors and warnings), for all modules.\n- Specifying a module name turns on log messages for that module only.\n- Specifying multiple modules turns on log messages for those modules only.\n- An absolute module (denoted by leading `::`) specifies an absolute module path from the top of the crate.\n- A module fragment specifies any module whose absolute top-level path ends in that string. For example, `a::b::c` would match modules `::d::e::a::b::c` or `::a::b::c`, but not `::a::b::c::d`. The first module in the path must match the name of the outermost module exactly, so `a::b::c` does not match `abracadabra::b::c`.\n",

    "body": "This seems to partially work. @astrieanna and I were trying to figure out how to fix this, and we got bogged down in the parsing code, trying to figure out how `RUST_LOG` affects the behavior of `__log(lvl, msg)`.\n\nThe [manual](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/rust.html#runtime-services-linkage-and-debugging) indicates that numbers should be used to indicate the logging level, but that feature appears to have been removed (or perhaps it's incomplete):\n\ndebug.rs\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    error!(\"error\")\n    warn!(\"warn\")\n    info!(\"info\")\n    debug!(\"debug\")\n}\n```\n\n```\n$ export RUST_LOG=0\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"\n$ export RUST_LOG=1\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"\n$ export RUST_LOG=2\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"\n$ export RUST_LOG=3\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"\n$ export RUST_LOG=4\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"\n```\n\nWe also tried to format described in this issue, which partially works.\n\n```\n$ export RUST_LOG=all\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"                                                                                                                                                   \n$ export RUST_LOG=error\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"\n$ export RUST_LOG=warning\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"\n$ export RUST_LOG=info\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"\n$ export RUST_LOG=debug\n$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"\\\"error\\\"\"\nrust: ~\"\\\"warn\\\"\"\nrust: ~\"\\\"info\\\"\"\nrust: ~\"\\\"debug\\\"\"\n```\n\nThe help command doesn't seem to be implemented. There's a `::help` and `?`, in [rust_log.cpp](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/rt/rust_log.cpp#L297) but that appears to be something completely different?\n\nIn [rust_log.h](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/rt/rust_log.h#L16), the different log levels are defined, and there are `#define` macros that use `log_debug` and `log_error`, but not `log_warn` and `log_info`. \n\nIt seems like we could fix this by defining the appropriate `#define` macros for `log_warn` and `log_info`, but we couldn't figure out if that's the right thing to do, because we don't undertand how they're being called (are LOG, DLOG, etc. only used for internal errors, or if __log somehow calls one of those macros). Also, we couldn't find where `RUST_LOG=debug` gets translated into `4`, so we aren't sure if the other logging levels are actually translated to anything.\n\nIf you understand the code associated with this issue, would you mind pointing us to the right things to look at, so we can take a crack at fixing it?\n",

    "body": "@danluu, @astrieanna: RUST_LOG is kind of arcane.  From https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-usage-FAQ : \n\n> RUST_LOG takes a 'logging spec' that consists of a comma-separated list of paths, where a path consists of the crate name and sequence of module names, each separated by double-colons. For standalone .rs files the crate is implicitly named after the source file\n\nFor your `debug.rs` example, the program implicitly consists of a single crate, which is called `debug`, so the path you use in the logging spec is simply `debug`.  I think this led to some confusion because in addition to being the crate name, `debug` is also the name of one of the logging levels, so you used it by accident up above!\n\n```\nlandin:~ lkuper$ rustc debug.rs\nwarning: no debug symbols in executable (-arch x86_64)\nlandin:~ lkuper$ export RUST_LOG=debug\nlandin:~ lkuper$ ./debug\nrust: ~\"error\"\nrust: ~\"warn\"\nrust: ~\"info\"\nrust: ~\"debug\"\nlandin:~ lkuper$\n```\n\nThe numbers, which indicate log levels, are optional, and you append them to the path with an equals sign (`=`).  The default log level is 4, which means \"log everything\", but you can narrow it down:\n\n```\nlandin:~ lkuper$ export RUST_LOG=debug=4; ./debug\nrust: ~\"error\"\nrust: ~\"warn\"\nrust: ~\"info\"\nrust: ~\"debug\"\nlandin:~ lkuper$ export RUST_LOG=debug=3; ./debug\nrust: ~\"error\"\nrust: ~\"warn\"\nrust: ~\"info\"\nlandin:~ lkuper$ export RUST_LOG=debug=2; ./debug\nrust: ~\"error\"\nrust: ~\"warn\"\nlandin:~ lkuper$ export RUST_LOG=debug=1; ./debug\nrust: ~\"error\"\nlandin:~ lkuper$ export RUST_LOG=debug=0; ./debug\nlandin:~ lkuper$\n```\n\nIt's admittedly kind of a pain to have to specify the crate name in the log spec, even when it's a single .rs file with no modules and there's only one path that could possibly be the one you mean.  RUST_LOG is optimized for the case of debugging large Rust executables (like `rustc` itself) that are built out of many crates with lots and lots of modules, where you want to pick and choose what gets logged with laser-like precision.\n\nTake this file, for instance:\n\n```\n// foo.rs\n\nmod a {\n\n    pub fn a() {\n        error!(\"error from module a\")\n        warn!(\"warn from module a\")\n        info!(\"info from module a\")\n        debug!(\"debug from module a\")\n    }\n}\n\nmod b {\n\n    pub fn b() {\n       error!(\"error from module b\")\n       warn!(\"warn from module b\")\n       info!(\"info from module b\")\n       debug!(\"debug from module b\")\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n   a::a();\n   b::b();\n}\n```\n\nIf I want to log everything, I can:\n\n```\nlandin:~ lkuper$ rustc foo.rs\nwarning: no debug symbols in executable (-arch x86_64)\nlandin:~ lkuper$ export RUST_LOG=foo; ./foo\nrust: ~\"error from module a\"\nrust: ~\"warn from module a\"\nrust: ~\"info from module a\"\nrust: ~\"debug from module a\"\nrust: ~\"error from module b\"\nrust: ~\"warn from module b\"\nrust: ~\"info from module b\"\nrust: ~\"debug from module b\"\nlandin:~ lkuper$\n```\n\nBut maybe I just want to log module `a`:\n\n```\nlandin:~ lkuper$ export RUST_LOG=foo::a; ./foo\nrust: ~\"error from module a\"\nrust: ~\"warn from module a\"\nrust: ~\"info from module a\"\nrust: ~\"debug from module a\"\nrust: ~\"error from module b\"\nlandin:~ lkuper$\n```\n\nHere we still get the error from module `b` because errors get logged by default unless we turn them off by setting module `b`'s log level to 0:\n\n```\nlandin:~ lkuper$ export RUST_LOG=foo::a,foo::b=0; ./foo\nrust: ~\"error from module a\"\nrust: ~\"warn from module a\"\nrust: ~\"info from module a\"\nrust: ~\"debug from module a\"\nlandin:~ lkuper$\n```\n\nSo, @steveklabnik's manual entry looks OK to me, but perhaps it could stand to have some examples of logging specifications.\n\n(The examples in this comment are with rustc 0.5.)\n",
