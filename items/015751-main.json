  "body": "In f1ad425199b0d89dab275a8c8f6f29a73d316f70, I changed the handling\nof macros, to prevent macro invocations from occurring in fully expanded\nsource. Instead, I added a side table. It contained only the\nspans of the macros, because this was the only information required\nin order to make macro export work.\n\nHowever, librustdoc was also affected by this change, since it\nextracts macro information in a similar way. As a result of the earlier\nchange, exported macros were no longer documented.\n\nIn order to repair this, I've adjusted the side table to contain whole\nitems, rather than just the spans.\n\nNote that the resulting macro documentation now appears at the\ntop level of the crate.\n\nFixes https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15645\n",
