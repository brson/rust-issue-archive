    "body": "Thank you for opening this jack.\n\nAssuming my understanding of the abstraction is correct I'm inclined is to make two fixes, one here in rust and one in servo. In rust from_str() should fail with a better error message if the str is missing a defined scheme. In servo the scheme should be autodetected with heuristics matching firefox's (so file: if substring(0,1) == '/').\n\nAn alternative approach would be for from_str() to perform the autodetection, would that be useful or frustrating?\n\nSorry Jack, I appear to be failing at keeping my thought train in one bug report.\n",

    "body": "I am not sure how to handle unicode. It appears my general issue is URLs are ANSI only and it is IRIs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier) which provide unicode support.\n\nSo in theory the URL class should remain ANSI only and a second IRI class should exist that wraps URL and performs encoding. Yet that might just confuse developers who will default to using url.\n\nSo the perfect solution should provide unicode support without developers paying attention. Current take might be to extend the URL class to act as IRI. I'll read the IRI RFC and assuming no one has any objections I'll extend the URL class to be an IRI class, no name change of course.\n",
