  "body": "Being able to index into the bytes of a string encourages\npoor UTF-8 hygiene. To get a view of `&[u8]` from either\na `String` or `&str` slice, use the `as_bytes()` method.\n\nCloses #12710.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nIf the diffstat is any indication this shouldn't have a huge impact but it will have some. Most changes in the `str` and `path` module. A lot of the existing usages were in tests where ascii is expected. There are a number of other legit uses where the characters are known to be ascii.\n",
