    "body": "I can see the need for something like this, but I'm a bit confused on the actual wording. It's called `RandomAccessIterator`, but nothing is being iterated over? It seems like this is simply another version of the `Index` trait with a size method. Morally speaking, it seems `RandomAccessIterator == Index + Container`, so should it possibly be renamed or derived from other names? I also can't think of a compelling use case for this, so I'm sure I'm missing something big. Is this meant to generalize something like a sorting algorithm over a container like a deque/array?\n\nAlso, cc #7766 \n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton: The `Container` trait doesn't work for this because the `len` method is the actual length, and iterators can be larger than a `uint` or even infinite. The `Index` trait is going to be removed (#6515) so I don't want to make any more code depending on it. It needs to be replaced before it can be used for this, and it's not certain it will be usable because it will have to make assumptions about mutability to replicate the vector syntax.\n\nRandom access iterators will allow generic algorithms (like sort or binary search) to work on any random access _iterator_, not just containers. For example you'll be able to chain together 2 vectors and a deque and sort them as a single range of values.\n",
