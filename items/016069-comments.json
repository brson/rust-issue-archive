    "body": "This is something that the compiler gives the user control over. The problem here is that the relevant library is not in your `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. You normally don't see this because rustc statically links executables by default (instead of dynamically linking).\n\nThere's really not much we can do here, but my suggestion to you is to build with `-C rpath` if you encounter problems such as this as that will help the binaries auto-find the libraries in question.\n\nIn general, though, this is failing at a stage of loading the binary that we have no control over, so I'm going to close this issue as not very actionable. Feel free to reopen if you disagree, however!\n",
