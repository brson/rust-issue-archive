There\u2019s some nice properties when you know `DIVERGE_BLOCK` is always an `unreachable`. `resume` is only relevant for function calls which have landing pads, and I believe translation for function calls should take care to generate necessary `resume` themselves, since they gonna have to generate necessary landingpad insns anyway.

What @nagisa says is, I think, true -- that is, that there isn't much useful code there. I'm not sure I included it exactly, probably just by analogy to the \"return\" block. Certainly, one could also make the argument that RETURN is not needed. I think mainly I was thinking that it's often easier for analysis purposes if you have a fixed set of \"postdominator\" blocks, but that may not be really true.\n",
