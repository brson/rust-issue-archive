    "body": "There is also some issue of consistency about where the setting of lint levels is permitted. Due to the way it's currently implemented, lints that are checked outside of `rustc::middle::lint` can only have their levels modified by command-line arguments or crate attributes. Lints that are checked from code inside of `rustc::middle::lint` can, in addition, have their lint levels modified by attributes on any view item, any item or any method. It's probably a good idea for the rules to be the same for all lint checks.\n",
