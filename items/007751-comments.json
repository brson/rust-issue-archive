    "body": "@huonw, I don't think that we should dictate the style of statics by default. Solving #7526 doesn't involve dictating what all programs should look like, but rather a more informative error message (if any).\n\nAlso you're right that it's \"faster\" by using `find_or_insert` rather than `find` and then `insert`, the lint is far more annoying than the few nanoseconds that this is going to add to the compilation time. If this does end up hitting perf, I'll revert it and just live with the lint for now.\n",
