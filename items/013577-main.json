  "body": "Importing names sometimes requires `use self::` as shown here: \n\nmain.rs\n\n```\nuse foo::Foo;\nmod foo;\n\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nfoo.rs\n\n```\nuse bar::Bar; //looks fine at first glance but is actually an error\nmod bar;\n\npub struct Foo {\n    bar: Bar\n}\n```\n\nbar.rs\n\n```\npub struct Bar;\n```\n\nSomeone new to Rust will almost certainly make this mistake, and then see the following error message:\n\n```\nfoo.rs:1:5: 1:8 error: unresolved import. maybe a missing `extern crate bar`?\nfoo.rs:1 use bar::Bar;\n             ^~~\nfoo.rs:1:5: 1:13 error: failed to resolve import `bar::Bar`\nfoo.rs:1 use bar::Bar;\n             ^~~~~~~~\n```\n\nPersonally I found this was the main source of frustration while learning Rust's module system because of my ingrained thinking in absolute paths.\n\nI think two changes would be helpful here:\n\nThe `maybe a missing extern crate bar` hint should only be given when appropriate (ie. when `mod bar;` cannot be resolved).\n\nThere should be a hint to maybe use `self::` when `use bar::Bar;` cannot be resolved and the current module is not the crate root.\n",
