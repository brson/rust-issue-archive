Fixing this cleanly requires poking around in the expand code; I looked briefly at doing so: one obstacle is that the expand code (and potentially the ast fold functions it uses) would need to be generalized to support mapping an `item` to a `~[item]`, rather than an `Option<item>` like it does now.  (The good news is that I think most of that change is largely mechanical.  But then again, I did not take the time to finish hacking it up.)\n",
