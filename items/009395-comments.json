    "body": "That sounds like a good idea to me! It looks like the usage falls into three categories:\n- README.md - not sure if this could get automatically updated (I don't think it should either though)\n- `*.po` files - these are generated, right?\n- src/libX/X.rs - this would involve `env!()` to work in `cfg`, although that'd probably make things too annoying to compile by hand.\n",
