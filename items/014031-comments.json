    "body": "It's sort of a weird case, because the \"normal\" behavior of a `probe!` is transparent, to do nothing, and the \"unsupported\" platforms can do nothing perfectly well -- that's why I included `platform/default.rs`. :)  The operation of the program is fine in any case, and those platforms will only miss out on the added support for external tools.  So I disagree that such platform support should be a blocker, because then you'll be forever limited to the least-common-denominator of tooling.\n\nOn the testing point, I was hoping for an answer whether GDB 7.5 can be relied on in the buildbots, then I'm happy to write tests targeting that.  Or if only some buildbots have GDB 7.5+, maybe there's a way to mark the tests ignored on others.  If GDB `break -probe` tests pass, I claim that's enough to say SystemTap would be fine too, since they use the same metadata.  (If not, that bug would belong on SystemTap anyway.)\n\nIf you still think it's not suitable, then I'll gladly publish it separately, but I think there's more value to having this included in standard rust, and little-to-no downside.  The worst case for rust is that it might produce SDT metadata that the tools can't understand, but rust programs will still work regardless.\n",

    "body": "I agree that this shouldn't be blocked solely based on the fact that it's only implemented for linux, but this is also a library that hasn't had much time to bake in the community to see how it works out and how it gets used. This is a perfect candidate for a cargo package to be super easy to install, but cargo is still in the works at this time.\n\nFor now, I think it's best to publish separately to get some experience with it getting used in the community. If this turns out to be the de-facto standard used throughout rust libraries, then I think it'd be a great fit for being part of the distribution. \n\nAlso, sorry, I thought I commented (bad memory), but the bots don't have GDB 7.5 right now. They're all on 7.4 or below. We could update them if necessary, however.\n\nIf it's ok with you, I'm going to close this for now, but I highly encourage you to publish in your own repo. This is a high-quality library which definitely deserves attention!\n",
