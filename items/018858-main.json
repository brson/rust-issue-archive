  "body": "This commit deprecates the entire libtime library in favor of the\nexternally-provided libtime in the rust-lang organization. Users of the\n`libtime` crate as-is today should add this to their Cargo manifests:\n\n```\n[dependencies.time]\ngit = \"https://github.com/rust-lang/time\"\n```\n\nTo implement this transition, a new function `Duration::span` was added to the\n`std::time::Duration` time. This function takes a closure and then returns the\nduration of time it took that closure to execute. This interface will likely\nimprove with `FnOnce` unboxed closures as moving in and out will be a little\neasier.\n\nDue to the deprecation of the in-tree crate, this is a:\n\n[breaking-change]\n\ncc #18855, some of the conversions in the `src/test/bench` area may have been a\nlittle nicer with that implemented\n",
