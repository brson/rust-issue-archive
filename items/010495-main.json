  "body": "This implements a fair amount of the unimpl() functionality in io::native\nrelating to filesystem operations. I've also modified all io::fs tests to run in\nboth a native and uv environment (so everything is actually tested).\n\nThere are a few bits of remaining functionality which I was unable to get\nworking:\n- truncate on windows\n- change_file_times on windows\n- lstat on windows\n\nI think that change_file_times may just need a better interface, but the other\ntwo have large implementations in libuv which I didn't want to tackle trying to\ncopy. I found a `chsize` function to work for truncate on windows, but it\ndoesn't quite seem to be working out.\n",
