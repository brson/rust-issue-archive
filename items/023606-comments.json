Certainly I'm interested in interaction between constants and types (note that I proposed rust-lang/rfcs#884, which is necessary, though far from sufficient, for some concrete applications I have in mind). Are you saying that _you_ have a justification for deferring evaluation until trans, or that you want to know would _I_ say about this? (I do think that such a change needs to happen, at least in some cases, but it's not directly relevant to this PR, I believe.)\n",

(I do think that such a change needs to happen, at least in some cases, but it's not directly relevant to this PR, I believe.)\n\nI wasn't really saying either of those things. Well, I do have justifications for potentially deferring evaluation until monomorphization -- e.g., type-checking `[i32; X::LEN]` -- but I wasn't suggesting it was relevant to this PR.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the delay.

But then I got distracted again by the beta deadline and in particular researching and implementing https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1023. Argh. I will look it over again today -- but now that there is a feature-gate, I feel pretty good about landing this before I understand every bit. We can improve over time.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis The original motivation for trying to get this in before the beta was to get rid of all the functions that deal with constants in `Int`/`Float`, and then to get rid of all the modules like `std::i64` that just hold constants as well. We could have dodged most of the issues (ICEs and generic code design) by using inherent impls instead of associating the constants with traits. But since #23549 came in a bit earlier and stabilized a bunch more of those constants before the beta, whereas this hasn't landed yet, blegh.\n\nAnyway, I'll try to rebase once more today, but I'm going to be on a trip tomorrow evening and may not be available next week, so I won't be doing much with this for a little while. I'll try to get back to some of these ICEs after that.\n",

For instance, I only rebased today because my car's getting work, and they have wifi in the waiting room. I'm also just getting a bit antsy because I want to work on fixing some of the tricky bits here, and move on to maybe trying to do something with dependent types, but I'm hesitant to add any more substantive changes on top of this until it gets merged.\n",
