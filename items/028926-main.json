  "body": "The intent with this chapter is to have a central place where users can\ngo to find out what a random bit of syntax means, be it a keyword,\nsymbol, or some unusual bit of composite syntax (like `for <...>`).  This\nshould be useful both for new users (who may not know what to call this\nweird `'blah` thing), and for experienced users (who may just wish to\nlink someone to the appropriate section on `Trait + Trait` bounds).\n\nWhere possible, entries have been linked to an appropriate section of\nthe book which explains the syntax.  This was not possible in all cases.\nIf an entry is missing links, that's because I was unable to _find_\nanything appropriate to link to.\n\nThis commit should include all stable keywords, operators and symbols,\nas well as a selection of potentially confusing or unusual syntax.\n",
