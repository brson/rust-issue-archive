It's more than a Coding Style guide, it's more a general reference page where one would find the convention to apply. Because I cannot look at the different \"convention\" used in different rust modules to write my own. I've setup this kind of naming / API convention document in my work, and this was quite successful. One would follow this doc for new development, and if a change in the convention occurs (changes will occur), it's more easier to find out \"what is good/what is bad\" at first sight.\n",
