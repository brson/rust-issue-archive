Something like this:\n\n```\nenum node = _node; // does this syntax still work?\ntype _node = { value: i32, next: *node };\n```\n\nought to work.   However, because this is a _native_ linked list, it might not... this is because we get alignment of enums totally wrong.  I'm actually not sure what's the best bug representing this issue, but #1535 is certainly a symptom.\n",

    "body": "To clarify, the `enum node = _node` syntax was (maybe still is) shorthand for:\n\n```\nenum node {\n    node(_node)\n}\n```\n\nType recursion is permitted through an enum.  Single variant enums are supposed to be represented without any discriminant, so this ought to be exactly equivalent to `_node`.  Except that we get the alignment wrong, so it's not _exactly_ equivalent in practice.\n",
