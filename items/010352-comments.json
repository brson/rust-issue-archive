The correct answer is to supply a manual type hint or just not call `map` -- adding a function like `apply` would do just as well, or creating a wrapper around `fail!` that hides the fact that it fails (which is what you are looking to do):\n\n```\nfn fail(s: ~str) { fail!(s); }\nmy_opt.map(|s| fail(format!(...)); )\n```\n",

We did this for a while and reverted it due to bugs I think, and possibly some surprising interactions. I'm inclined not to change the inference rules, personally, partially because I'm not too happy with our inference scheme and I don't want to get locked into defaults we might want to change.\n",
