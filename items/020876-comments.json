    "body": "TL;DR Probably the deprecated `~` operator, that was used to box things. `~\"foo\"` created a `Box<str>`, where as `~[1, 2]` created a `Box<[T]>`.\n\nAccording to the compiler internals, we have [4 unary operators](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ast/enum.UnOp.html) (in the AST):\n\n(Operator name : [expression](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ast/enum.Expr_.html#variant.ExprUnary))\n- `UnUniq`: `~\"string\"` (which is deprecated syntax)\n- `UnDeref`: `*boxed_thing`\n- `UnNot`: `!bits`\n- `UnNeg`: `-num`\n\nFrom the POV of the compiler, the feature gated `box thing` is an [expression](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ast/enum.Expr_.html#variant.ExprBox). And references `&foo`/`&mut bar` are also [expressions](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ast/enum.Expr_.html#variant.ExprAddrOf).\n\nYou may think of `&` as the \"address of\" operator, and `box` as the \"box\" operator. But that's not quite right, because when you use them in patterns like `let &e = &(2, 3)`, they don't perform any operation at all.\n",
