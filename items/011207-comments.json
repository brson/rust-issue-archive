    "body": "Regarding fixing this, I see a few approaches:\n- Have rustc write out a .rc file (resource source file), then use windres tool to compile it to an object file.  Pass resulting object file to the linker.\n  - Pros: Flexible.   Manifest can be modified per-executable (e.g. to change the requested invocation privilege level).\n  - Cons: Requires invocation of an external tool.\n- Include a .rc file containing the manifest in rust source tree, compile it using windres during librustc build, include produced object file into librustc via include_bin!(...).   When compiling executable targeting Windows, write binary blob into .o file, and pass it to the linker.\n  - Pros: Don't need to invoke windres tool on every compilation.\n  - Cons: Manifest can't be altered without rebuilding rust compiler.\n- Create .o file containing manifest directly.\n  - Pros: Flexible.   Can alter manifest as needed.\n  - Cons: Complexity.  Will need to implement a COFF file writer.\n- Link executable without resources, then insert resource section into the output .exe file (without using Windows' UpdateResource API).\n  - Pros: Flexible.   Can alter manifest as needed.\n  - Cons: Complexity.   Need to parse/alter/emit COFF headers.   Though probably less complex than approach No3.\n\nCurrently we have no need to alter .exe manifests, and if really needed this can always be done afterwards using windres tool, so I am leaning towards option 2.\n",
