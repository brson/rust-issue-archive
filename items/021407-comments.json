This is useful for the case where the author of `Bar` wants to reserve the right to add new private members to `Bar` while still allowing for clients to use the convenient FRU syntax.\n\n---\n\nI originally was going to try to explain my point of view via analogy with something from hygienic macros: If I were to define (and _export_) a macro within `Bar`'s defining module:\n\n``` rust\nmod foo {\n    pub struct Bar { ... }\n    #[macro_export_or_whatever]\n    macro_rules! bar_update_xy {\n        ($x:expr, $y:expr, $b:expr) =>\n          { Bar { x: $x, y: $y,\n            other_1: $b.other_1,\n            [... manually list other fields here ...]\n            other_k: $b.other_k } }\n    }\n}\n\nlet b1: Bar = ...;\nlet b2 : Bar = bar_update_xy!(new_x(), new_y(), b1));\n```\n\nthen it should, in principle, _not_ be a privacy violation to use `bar_update_xy!` from client code outside `Bar`'s defining module.  (That is, in principle, hygiene should allow macros to expose controlled access to private internals.)\n\nThen I realized the crucial problem with that kind of analogy: `bar_update_xy!` is something that the designer of `Bar` has to choose to put into the module; i.e., it is _opt-in_.  But currently in Rust, FRU is not opt-in; its not even something you can opt out of.  Any struct automatically is given support for it, whether it be appropriate for that struct or not.  And _that_ seems wrong, at least given examples like the one provided here in #21407.\n\nThis latter point, that providing support for FRU should not be something that is silently attached to a type like `Vec`, seems somewhat in line with the thinking given in @glaebhoerl's [draft RFC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glaebhoerl/rust-notes/master/my_rfcs/Distinguish%20data%20types%20from%20abstract%20types.txt). But I am also pretty sure we cannot adopt anything of the scope given in that draft.  (Still, maybe there's a hint of solution embedded within, in the sense of having some way of marking a type as data vs abstract; see final two bullet points below.)\n\n---\n\nSo, as I see it, we can either:\n1. Figure out a way to support the point-of-view outlined here in the description for #21407, in that `Bar { x: new_x, y: new_y, ..old_b }` should somehow be treated as consuming `old_b`.\n   \n   Such a change   seems like it would be quite subtle, since we would need to have   some way of expressing that code like `{ x: old_b.x.f(), y: old_b.y.g(), ..old_b }` is sound, even if the types of the fields   `x` and `y` are consumed by their respective `f` and `g` methods.\n   \n   (In other words, `..old_b` need to consume `old_b`, yet somehow not   completely consume it.  Maybe there's a way to think of it as   consuming \"whatever is left of the type\", I do not know.)\n   \n   Advantages: This would address the bug as described by the issue   author, and would not break any code that was not already broken.\n   \n   Drawbacks: It is not clear what the semantics are for this form (in   other words: the phrase \"would not break any code\" above is only   true if you first accept that this hypothesized semantics   exists). Also, there may not be time to do this properly for 1.0.\n2. Or, try to adopt a data/abstract-type distinction along the lines of the one in @glaebhoerl's draft RFC. (I'm not going to write Advantages/Drawbacks for this; I think we clearly do not have time to do it that way for 1.0)\n3. Or, change FRU into a non-hygienic expansion into the record   construction form with all fields listed, in the sense that `Vec { ..v }` is synonymous with `Vec { ptr: v.ptr, len: v.len, cap: v.cap }` and subject to privacy checks.\n   \n   Advantages: Seems really simple to implement, and is consistent with   at least one core team member's mental model of FRU.\n   \n   Drawbacks: If we did this, then code like the `Bar` example above   would break.\n4. Or, let FRU keep its current hygienic (aka \"privacy violating\")   semantics, but also make FRU something one must opt-in to support   on a type.\n   \n   E.g. make a builtin `FunUpdate` trait that a struct must implement in order to be usable with FRU. (Or maybe its an attribute you attach to the `struct` item.)\n   \n   Advantages: Also seems really simple to implement (in the language). Accommodates users of FRU for the `Bar` example.\n   \n   Drawbacks: If we did this, it would impose a burden on all code   today that makes use of FRU, since they would have to start   implementing `FunUpdate`. Thus, _not_ simple to implement   for the libraries and the overall ecosystem.\n5. Or, a hybrid between the previous two bullet-points: By default,   treat FRU as non-hygienic expansion, but add a builtin    `HygienicFunUpdate` trait that one can opt-into to get the hygienic (aka   \"privacy violating\") semantics.  As a bonus, perhaps implementing   `Copy` on a struct would also imply implementing   `HygienicFunUpdate` on that struct, which seems like it would   basically give us something very similar to the semantics desired   by @arielb1.\n   \n   (Or, again, maybe its an attribute you attach to the `struct` item.  This detail does not particularly matter to me.)\n   \n   Advantage: While this is obviously more complicated than the   previous two bullet-points, it has the advantage that it has a   staged landing strategy: We could _just_ implement the change to   FRU to be non-hygienic expansion for 1.0 beta.  We could add `HygienicFunUpdate` at an arbitrary point in the future; it would not have to be in the 1.0 release.\n   \n   Drawback: People have claimed that some of my past proposals were   a bit ... baroque. I imagine this one is no exception.  :)  (In other words, this semantics is a little complicated to explain to a newcomer.)\n",

The blanket refusal to even _contemplate_ doing that - even in light of new information - and to weigh the tradeoffs on their own merits is something I still don't really understand.\n\nThat out of the way, an additional possibility, let's call it 6., for @pnkfelix's list:\n- We could just make the \"abstract type\" vs. \"data type\" distinction based on \"does or doesn't the type have a private field\". This doesn't entirely fill me with satisfaction (as with \"worse is better\" solutions in general), with specific drawbacks being that it doesn't extend cleanly to the nullary case (no fields at all), and that in terms of UX a change of semantics based on the presence or absence of a private field may be unexpected, but on the plus side, it's simpler, and _would_, I think, work.\n",

Here is why: It is relatively easy for a developer who wants to provide that sort of extensible abstraction can still do it, by factoring the type into a all-public front-end with a single public field that holds the all-private back-end, like so:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    use foo::Foo;\n    let f1 = Foo::new(13, 14);\n    let f2 = Foo { x: 23, y: 24, ..f1 };\n    println!(\"f2: {:?}\", f2);\n}\n\nmod foo {\n    pub struct Foo {\n        pub x: u8,\n        pub y: u8,\n        pub private_data: FooPrivate,\n    }\n\n    pub struct FooPrivate {\n        _other_1: u8,\n        _other_2: u8,\n        // developer is free to add new fields here\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nhttp://is.gd/XM1akn\n\nSo, given that there exists a reasonable pattern to bring back usable FRU even under the option \"(3.) change FRU into a non-hygienic expansion into the record construction form with all fields listed, in the sense that `Vec { ..v }` is synonymous with `Vec { ptr: v.ptr, len: v.len, cap: v.cap }` and subject to privacy checks.\", I would not object to us adopting (3.) aka @nikomatsakis's solution.\n",

    "body": "I mean, Rust already has a mechanism for ensuring representation-abstraction \u2013 private fields \u2013 which _are_ semantic (they are handled after type-checking, we probably want to handle them during it, but they definitely aren't handled syntactically or during resolution). It is just that FRU currently accesses them improperly.\n\nAlso, it doesn't have much to do with e.g. roles \u2013 `&Vec<*mut T>` is an abstract type, but it doesn't use any bound on `T`. `&Vec<T>` only uses the implicit `Sized` bound. A `#[derive(Pod)]` for data-only types would be nice, through.\n",

    "body": "Another alternative came to me while I was drafting an RFC about this.  (But its an alternative that I do not particularly like.)\n- 8a Instead of making \"has any private fields\" the thing that makes FRU unavailable, instead make the rule be \"has _all_ private fields.\"  Thus types like `Vec` and `HashMap` will not be subject to the vulnerability outlined here.  Adding a single `pub` field to an otherwise private struct is what changes the nature of a struct with respect to abstraction and FRU, rather than adding a single non-`pub` field to an otherwise public struct.\n- 8b, which is so similar to 8a that I gave them both the same numeral: Outlaw the trivial FRU form `Foo { ..<expr> }`.  That is, to use FRU, you have to use at least _one_ field in the constructing expression.  Again, this implies that types like `Vec` and `HashMap` will not be subject to the vulnerability outlined here.\n  \n  (This may be a decent change to make to the language regardless of whatever else happens on this ticket; the only argument in favor of keeping support for such a trivial form is maybe for supporting certain macro-expansions.  But fully-general macro-authors already have to tread very carefully around corner cases on structs, due to issues like the empty braces problem (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/218)\n",
