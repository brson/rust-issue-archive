    "body": "@tbu- \n\nFirst off, this is _awesome_! I definitely think the code is cleaner this way, and I love the work you put into the comments making the algorithm clear.\n\nSecond, I'm sorry for the delay in having this reviewed -- it seems to've fallen through the cracks. In the future, feel free to ping me or any other member of the team by leaving an \"r? @aturon\" comment or messaging on IRC if your PR goes unreviewed for more than a day or two.\n\nMeantime, I'm handing this off to bors. Nice work!\n",
