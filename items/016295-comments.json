    "body": "@michaelsproul `Bar` is an instantiation of the zero-field struct with type `Bar`. He's arguing that it should be able to infer that it is a `Bar::<int>` because `Bar<T>` impls `Foo<T>` and the `get` function only takes a `Foo<int>`, ergo a passed in `Bar` should be a `Bar::<int>`.\n\nThe reason this doesn't work is that there could actually be multiple types that could fit into `Bar<T>` that makes it impl `Foo<int>`, for instance code like this:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo<T> {}\nstruct Bar<T>;\nimpl Foo<int> for Bar<uint> {}\nimpl Foo<int> for Bar<int> {}\n\nfn get<H: Foo<int>>(val: H) {}\n\nfn main() {\n    get(Bar);\n}\n```\n\nIs ambiguous, as either a `Bar<int>` or `Bar<uint>` could fulfill the constraint. You must hint which, even if there is only impl _in scope_ as adding a module or impl would suddenly cause this to stop compiling. My understanding is this doesn't work because that behavior is not ideal.\n",
