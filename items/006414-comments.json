For some reason, I was getting test failures (on the tests I wrote myself). \n\nI compiled a simple test Rust program and testing hash_table.to_str() works fine.\n\nThe order in which the elements are accessed is prone to change. I think that is why the test may have failed. I'll try getting the empty HashMap test to pass and recommit.\n",
