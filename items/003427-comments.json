The difficulty is I have `vec2`, `vec3` and `vec4` all in the same module. So calling `vec::dim` isn't really an option. It would mean having to split everything up into separate files.\n\nGood to see that there's some discussion going on, as it would be really nice to take more advantages of traits with static functions.\n",
