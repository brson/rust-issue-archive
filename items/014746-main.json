  "body": "This commit is the final step in the libstd facade, #13851. The purpose of this\ncommit is to move libsync underneath the standard library, behind the facade.\nThis will allow core primitives like channels, queues, and atomics to all live\nin the same location.\n\nThere were a few notable changes and a few breaking changes as part of this\nmovement:\n- The `Vec` and `String` types are reexported at the top level of libcollections\n- The `unreachable!()` macro was copied to libcore\n- The `std::rt::thread` module was moved to librustrt, but it is still\n  reexported at the same location.\n- The `std::comm` module was moved to libsync\n- The `sync::comm` module was moved under `sync::comm`, and renamed to `duplex`.\n  It is now a private module with types/functions being reexported under\n  `sync::comm`. This is a breaking change for any existing users of duplex\n  streams.\n- All concurrent queues/deques were moved directly under libsync. They are also\n  all marked with #![experimental] for now if they are public.\n- The `task_pool` and `future` modules no longer live in libsync, but rather\n  live under `std::sync`. They will forever live at this location, but they may\n  move to libsync if the `std::task` module moves as well.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
