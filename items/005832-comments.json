    "body": "I think it's fine to adopt _something_ like this. I'm uncomfortable about this as-presented for the following reasons:\n- I think it'd be _nice_ (though not necessarily easy) to encode more-portable logic in rust itself; I'm concerned that this may be an OS, charset and libc variable function? Calling libc for this seems a bit awkward.\n- I think it'd be _nice_ to support a stronger version that uses, say, regexps (not that we have a regexp library yet either). Globs are quite simple.\n- The current code here always allocates, whereas I'd like it to provide callbacks with slices if it's got pre-allocated strings already. Unless, I guess ... hm, difficult design choice: currently `Path` as designed owns its string components, so I guess it's congruent. But it might be worth revisiting, now that we have working borrowed pointers? (we did not really when `Path` was created)\n- The current code places an imperative search in the `path` module. So far we've put operations that touch the filesystem in `os` and reserved the `path` module for _just_ pure operations on the in-memory type representing paths.\n",

    "body": "- Yes, I agree - long term at least, the user-facing version should probably not use the libc glob functions, if for no other reason than portability (we'll have to include an internal version for windows support anyway, so there's not really any reason for us to not use that internal implementation for all platforms). This was really just to start trying out what an API for this would look like - I do think that something like this is something that we want in the standard library, and using the POSIX glob functions seemed like the easiest way to get something implemented. Do you think it's worth including a preliminary version using this sort of implementation, with the intention of replacing it with something better later? Or do you want to hold off for a better implementation?\n- Adding more features would probably be good too. I don't know that we need a full regex thing, but Ruby's glob implementation for instance supports `**` for recursive matches. Having the capability to do things like that would be nice.\n- That's probably reasonable, although no reason that we couldn't provide both.\n- Sounds fine to me.\n",
