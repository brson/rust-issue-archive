    "body": "Thanks for the report!\n\nThe problem here is you're redeclaring the variable `<T>` when you write `fn new<T>` and `fn assign<T>`, so that the `T` stored in `self` and that of `newVal` are different types.\n\nThis problem will be made more obvious if https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/11658 is fixed. (And so I'm closing as a dupe.)\n\n(Also, btw, you can make code formatted more readable by using [code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks) around them. e.g. I edited it to look like\n\n``````\n```rust\n//use std::task;\n[...]\n```\n``````\n\n.)\n",
