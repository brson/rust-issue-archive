    "body": "I am not sure if this is possible, actually.  The problem is with task supervision: the correct behavior, from my point of view, is that you do not receive a \"parent completed\" notification until all supervised children have completed.  This is because the parent may fail due to a supervised child having failed.  If we put the notification message into a resource, it will fire a \"succeeded!\" msg as soon as the parent's task completes, but it may be that some child has not yet completed so the parent may later actually be killed.  Therefore I am going to close the issue.\n",
