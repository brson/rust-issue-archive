Normally bit vectors are are specifically to be fast, so if iteration is super slow it seems to defeat the purpose... Others may have different opinions though. If there's an obvious speedup in the future once external iterators are \"more solid\" then that's fine, but I'm not sure how this would get much better.\n\nI'm kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't entirely switch from internal to external iterators. In some cases it's really nice and convenient, but it's not 100% necessary all the time.\n",

    "body": "So I've done some digging and it looks like the performance problems may actually be an issue with the benchmark framework rather than any of the bitv code.\n\nI wrote up a quick test: https://gist.github.com/sfackler/0efb2f23738898b9b938. I commented out the iter benchmarks and compiled and ran it under `master` without any of the bitv changes with these results:\n\n```\ntest bench_bitv_big_each ... bench: 828 ns/iter (+/- 665)\ntest bench_bitv_small_each ... bench: 33 ns/iter (+/- 14)\n```\n\nI then cherry-picked 128bdad onto `master` and un-deleted `each` from Bitv. I compiled the test with the iter benchmarks and ran it with these results:\n\n```\ntest bench_bitv_big_each ... bench: 4008 ns/iter (+/- 2122)\ntest bench_bitv_small_each ... bench: 248 ns/iter (+/- 104)\ntest bench_btv_big_iter ... bench: 4015 ns/iter (+/- 2117)\ntest bench_btv_small_iter ... bench: 248 ns/iter (+/- 89)\n```\n\nKeep in mind that all 128bdad did was add an `iter` function to Bitv and BitvSet and corresponding iterator types. I checked the disassembly of the two benchmarks and it turns out that `bench_bitv_small_{each,iter}` compiled down to the _exact_ same instruction sequence: https://gist.github.com/sfackler/8cce21f68c222c4dcb37.\n\nHere's the runtimes with the other changes (deriving Clone and removing indirection):\n\n```\ntest bench_bitv_big_each ... bench: 3830 ns/iter (+/- 4244)\ntest bench_bitv_small_each ... bench: 235 ns/iter (+/- 256)\ntest bench_btv_big_iter ... bench: 3757 ns/iter (+/- 1722)\ntest bench_btv_small_iter ... bench: 248 ns/iter (+/- 150)\n```\n\nThe disassembly is more or less the same with one less call to free: https://gist.github.com/sfackler/6cf1c8d5fd7fc0cf53cb\n\nI have a change that removes `ones` that's compiling right now. I'll push up in a bit.\n",

I think its synonymous with [\"stack thrashing\"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2258579/what-is-stack-thrash)\n\nNote that in the IRC log linked above, the suggestion was to play with the setting for `RUST_MIN_STACK` to see if it makes such performance problems go away; then you'd have some evidence that stack thrashing is to blame.\n",
