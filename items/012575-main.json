  "body": "With linkers on unix systems, libraries on the right of the command line are\nused to resolve symbols in those on the left of the command line. This means\nthat arguments must have a right-to-left dependency chain (things on the left\ndepend on things on the right).\n\nThis is currently done by ordering the linker arguments as\n1. Local object\n2. Local native libraries\n3. Upstream rust libraries\n4. Upstream native libraries\n\nThis commit swaps the order of 2 and 3 so upstream rust libraries have access to\nlocal native libraries. It has been seen that some upstream crates don't specify\nthe library that they link to because the name varies per platform (e.g.\nlua/glfw/etc).\n\nThis commit enables building these libraries by allowing the upstream rust crate\nto have access to local native libraries. I believe that the failure mode for\nthis scheme is when an upstream rust crate depends on a symbol in an upstream\nlibrary which is then redefined in a local library. This failure mode is\nincredibly uncommon, and the failure mode also varies per platform (OSX behaves\ndifferently), so I believe that a change like this is fine to make.\n\nCloses #12446\n",
