    "body": "> Let's just see if we can avoid using @fn, since their future is in doubt.\n\nI've tried that but we can't use an `&fn` here because the struct containing the closure outlives the allocating stack frame. I tried using a `~fn` but those can't capture `span` values (which contain managed pointers internally). Do you know of a way to the tell compiler that the `~fn` does not need to be sendable? \n\nAll that being said, I think this will need a refactoring within the next few weeks anyway---so it might be OK to leave the `@fn` as is for now and get rid of it later as part of a bigger change.\n",
