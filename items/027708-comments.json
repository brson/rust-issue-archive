That sort of contract would be violated where even if the mutator were paused an optimization may still trigger undefined behavior.\n\nConcretely, if the source looked like:\n\n``` rust\nlet slot = a.borrow_mut();\nprintln!(\"{}\", slot.foo);\nfunction();\nprintln!(\"{}\", slot.foo);\n```\n\nIt seems like a valid optimization that the value loaded from `slot.foo` doesn't need to be reloaded across the call to `function`. The function has mutable access to the contents, so it's \"guaranteed\" that no one else has access to the pointer, but if some sort of mutation or something happened then badness may arise.\n\nAgain though, this is all very hypothetical, I'd certainly be willing to believe that the exact situation here actually works out due to some combination of some actions or whatnot.\n",

    "body": "\ud83d\udd14 This issue is now entering a cycle-long **final comment period** \ud83d\udd14 \n\nThe libs team was a bit up in the air about what to do about this method. It was pointed out that we may wish to prefer a method like `as_ptr` rather than `as_unsafe_cell` to get access to the innards, but there's still the open question of \"when is it safe to actually use this?\".\n\nOf the three states that a RefCell can be in:\n- Not borrowed - seems like it's safe to read/write the pointer so long as it's in a controlled situation. This is basically just as-if `borrow_mut` succeeded but without checking.\n- Borrowed but shared - should be fine to treat as if an extra call to `borrow` succeeded, but mutation seems like it's definitely out of the question.\n- Borrowed mutably - it's unclear that **anything** is safe to do here. Some of this is tied up in memory model questions as well, though.\n\nThere was a general sentiment that to stabilize we need to document what you can actually do with the return value. That is, we're returning an unsafe pointer, but there should be _some_ safe operations you can do on it which would otherwise be impossible with the borrow/borrow_mut methods.\n\nIt was thought that depending on what Servo needs here it may actually be a different abstraction that's needed (e.g. something that can **always** be traced regardless of borrow state), but we weren't actually 100% clear on what Servo was actually using these methods for still. @SimonSapin  or @jdm, could you clarify exactly how Servo is using these methods today?\n\nOverall the libs team feels like FCP is appropriate because:\n- If we determine that these methods should exist, we have clear semantics, and we're comfortable, then they're ready for stabilization.\n- If those conditions aren't met, they're ready for deprecation.\n\nSo basically, we'd like to foster discussion during the FCP to see what the fate should be!\n",

    "body": "I\u2019m not entirely sure why we use this in Servo layout. My current guess is that it\u2019s what I\u2019ll call a \"YOLO\u00a0RW lock\". We have one thread (script) that can write to this data, and N threads (layout) that can read it. We don\u2019t want lots of fine-grained actual `RWLock`s since all that synchronization is expensive, but we already have coarse-grained synchronization that makes sure these sets of threads don\u2019t run at the same time.\n\nBut `RefCell::borrow` is not read-only, it writes to the borrow flag/counter. So we can\u2019t use it from multiple threads without data races. So we use unsafe code to bypass the runtime borrow checking (dereferencing the raw pointer from `.as_unsafe_cell().get()`) and to bypass `RefCell<T>: !Sync`.\n\nWe don\u2019t use a raw `UnsafeCell<T>` because the `borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` methods are still useful within the script (writing) thread.\n\n---\n\n> It was thought that depending on what Servo needs here it may actually be a different abstraction that's needed\n\nWe can always build our own things on top of `UnsafeCell<T>`. And in a way it\u2019s what we did, except the thing we have now happens to be 100% identical to `std::cell::RefCell<T>`, and duplicating that code seem unfortunate. (Say if a bug is found and fixed in `std::cell::RefCell<T>`, we\u2019d have to backport it manually.)\n",
