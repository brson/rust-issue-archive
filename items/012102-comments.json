    "body": "Another problem I just uncovered:\n\nLet's say that I have my own syntax extension inside of directory `foo`. To use this syntax, extension I will pass `-L foo` to the compiler. The compiler will then open up `foo/libmymacro-ffffff-1.0.dylib` in an attempt to read the metadata and find the macro registrar. By default, crate loading will load dependencies as well. This means that when `libmymacro` is built for the _host_ architecture, it will load the _target_ architecture's `libstd` metadata (!!!).\n\nThe new SVH infrastructure has detected this bug because the SVH is different between target/host crates. This could be fixed with a combination of #10814 and perhaps some more clever infrastructure for loading syntax extensions with a different target architecture.\n",
