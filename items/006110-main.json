  "body": "As discussed on issue #4819, I have created four new traits: `Algebraic`, `Trigonometric`, `Exponential` and `Hyperbolic`, and moved the appropriate methods into them from `Real`.\n\n``` rust\npub trait Algebraic {\n    fn pow(&self, n: Self) -> Self;\n    fn sqrt(&self) -> Self;\n    fn rsqrt(&self) -> Self;\n    fn cbrt(&self) -> Self;\n    fn hypot(&self, other: Self) -> Self;\n}\n\npub trait Trigonometric {\n    fn sin(&self) -> Self;\n    fn cos(&self) -> Self;\n    fn tan(&self) -> Self;\n    fn asin(&self) -> Self;\n    fn acos(&self) -> Self;\n    fn atan(&self) -> Self;\n    fn atan2(&self, other: Self) -> Self;\n}\n\npub trait Exponential {\n    fn exp(&self) -> Self;\n    fn exp2(&self) -> Self;\n    fn expm1(&self) -> Self;\n    fn log(&self) -> Self;\n    fn log2(&self) -> Self;\n    fn log10(&self) -> Self;\n}\n\npub trait Hyperbolic: Exponential {\n    fn sinh(&self) -> Self;\n    fn cosh(&self) -> Self;\n    fn tanh(&self) -> Self;\n}\n```\n\nThere was some discussion over whether we should shorten the names, for example `Trig` and `Exp`. No abbreviations have been agreed on yet, but this could be considered in the future.\n\nAdditionally, `Integer::divisible_by` has been renamed to `Integer::is_multiple_of`.\n",
