  "body": "Consider the following function in extra::sync. There is a race condition where after the peek another thread can `recv` from the `head` port. This race condition looks like it would cause an accident an extremely small number of times because the `peek`, and the `recv` are so close together but when the action does occur it will cause the really bad, and unexpected (to the user of `Waitqueue`) effect of the `signal` method to block on `head`!\n\n```\nfn signal_waitqueue(q: &Waitqueue) -> bool {\n    // The peek is mandatory to make sure recv doesn't block.\n    if q.head.peek() {\n        // Pop and send a wakeup signal. If the waiter was killed, its port\n        // will have closed. Keep trying until we get a live task.\n        if comm::try_send_one(q.head.recv(), ()) {\n            true\n        } else {\n            signal_waitqueue(q)\n        }\n    } else {\n        false\n    }\n}\n```\n",
