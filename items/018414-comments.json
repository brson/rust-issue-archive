    "body": "It wouldn't be hard to convert most of the `Reader`s and `Writer`s in the standard library over to this. And some of them would be improved by it. For example, `LimitReader` could be implemented like this:\n\n```\nimpl<R: Reader> Reader for LimitReader<R> {\n    type Error = Option<R::Error>;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThis would give the ability to distinguish between errors caused be exceeding the limit and errors raised by the underlying reader by returning `None` and `Some(e)` respectively. For types that never return an error (eg. `NullWriter`, `MemWriter`, `ZeroReader`), it would be useful to have a standard empty type that they could use as their error type...\n\n```\nenum Empty {}\n\nimpl Reader for ZeroReader {\n    type Error = Empty;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n`Result` could then be extended with `safe_unwrap` method that's guaranteed to never fail.\n\n```\nimpl<T> Result<T, Empty> {\n    fn safe_unwrap(self) -> T {\n        match self {\n            Ok(t) => t,\n            Err(e) => match e {},\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n",
