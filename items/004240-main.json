  "body": "r? @tjc\n\nThis makes some significant changes to your work on static methods and trait inheritance, moving most of the static method discussion to the section on methods, adding explicit self everywhere, deleting a bunch of uninteresting and rote material from the syntax basics section and trying to reintegrate the most important parts in passing.\n\nBecause explicit self requires talking about pointers I broke the section on functions and methods into two sections. functions comes before pointers and methods comes after, just before generics.\n",
