  "body": "It turns out that bindings introduced by 'for' loops were not treated hygienically. The fix for this is to make the 'for' expansion more like a macro; rather than expanding sub-pieces and then assembling them, we need to rewrite the for and then call expand again on the whole thing.\n\nThis PR includes a test and the fix.\n\nIt also contains a number of other things:\n- unit tests for other forms of hygiene (currently ignored)\n- a fix for the isaac.rs macro that (it turned out) was relying on capturing\n- other miscellaneous cleanup and comments\n",
