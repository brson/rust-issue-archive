    "body": "I like this idea.\n\nNote a version of this is currently possible with a recursive macro:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! count_expr {\n    () => { 0 };\n    ($_e: expr $(, $rest: expr)*) => { 1 + count_expr!($($rest),*) }\n}\n```\n\nOf course, this is slow (possibly even O(n^2), due to some implementation details/bugs), and a separate version of this is needed for every possible non-terminal, e.g. the `expr` one can't (easily) be reused to count `item`s.\n\nThat said, I have wanted a macro/thing like this rather than the `count_expr` hack, but I think there are some subtleties to consider, e.g.\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! foo {\n    ( $( $( $e: expr ),* );* ) => {\n        (#( $($e)* ), \n         #($e))\n    }\n}\n\nfoo!(1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6, 7) // == (2, 7) ?\n```\n- is `#($e)` at the top level valid (i.e. when `$e` has two levels of repeats)? if so, what does it count? (the total number of `$e`'s across all copies of the outer repeat? )\n- is `#($($e))`  valid as a way to count the number of exterior repeats?\n\nAlso, I don't quite understand\n\n> Since the individual elements in a multiplicative pattern can contain an arbitrary tree of expressions, # would recursively count all the elements that would expand to a specific $identifier.\n\ncould you explain it with an example?\n",

    "body": "@huonw What I meant is exactly your first bullet point. That, in your example, it should count \"the total number of $e's across all copies of the outer repeat\".\n\n> is #($($e)) valid as a way to count the number of exterior repeats?\n\nI think so. An alternative would be to allow you to bind a whole sequence of items to an identifier:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! foo {\n    ( $( $outer( $e: expr ),* );* ) => {\n        (#($outer), \n         #($e))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNot sure if that would create any ambiguity in the syntax.\n",
