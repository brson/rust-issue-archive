    "body": "Hmmm. I pretty sure I put a comment here, and now its gone. Strange. Anyway. Here it goes again.\n\nAlphabetical order == random order. That's great when you know what you are looking for and just want to find it.\n\nWhen coming to a new non-trivial code base, being presented the content in random order is just about the worst possible way to access it.\n\nNested modules allow us to group related modules together, and that's a good thing. If you have a long list of modules, certainly, group them. But this doesn't solve the problem. You now have a TOC where each level is randomized, which is still inaccessible.\n\nSearching for a function or module by name is an important use case, sure. But being able to access a new code base is as important, if not more so.\n\nLooking up a name in a short non-alphabetized list (at each level) isn't too hard, and one can always compensate for the lack of an alphabetical index by using ^F. Trying to understand a system presented in random order is next to impossible, and one can not compensate for the lack of a comprehensible order in a large system.\n\nIf there was a way to specify the order of the entries in each level, which we agree should only contain \"a few\" entries, then the TOC would become accessible. If one could even add a bit of annotation for each level, so much the better. The annotated TOC would serve as a very accessible way for a newcomer to understand the code base.\n\nAnd, this doesn't rule out also generating an alphabetically sorted reference index, beside the TOC. All good books do both - a TOC in reasonable order and an index for looking up data by name. We shouldn't have to choose, we should be able to get both.\n\nSo, I misnamed the issue. It should be \"Rustdoc shouldn't list modules _only_ alphabetically\".\n",
