  "body": "I found these automatically, but fixed them manually to ensure the semantics are correct. I know things like these are hardly important, since they only marginally improve clarity. But at least for me typos and simple grammatical errors trigger an---unjustified---sense of unprofessionalism, despite the fact that I make them all the time and I understand that they're the sort of thing that is bound to slip through review.  \n\nAnyway, to find most of these I used:\n- `ag '.*//.*(\\b[A-Za-z]{2,}\\b) \\1\\b'` for repeated words\n- `ag '\\b(the|this|those|these|a|it) (a|the|this|those|these|it)\\b'` to find constructs like 'the this' etc. many false positives, but not too hard to scroll through them to actually find the mistakes.\n- `cat ../../typos.txt | paste -d'|' - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | tr '\\n' '\\0' | xargs -0 -P4 -n1 ag`. Hacky way to find misspellings, but it works ok. I got `typos.txt` from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines)\n- `ag '.*//.* a ([ae][a-z]|(o[^n])|(i[a-rt-z]))'` to find places where 'a' was followed by a vowel (requiring 'an' instead).\n\nI also used a handful more one off regexes that are too boring to reproduce here.\n",
