    "body": "> There should be a runtime error (start > end)\n\nThese are meant to be easily composed without failure. It's sensible to not produce any numbers if the start is larger than the end, rather than treating it as error. This is usually the desired behaviour.\n\n> When iterating by using `range` with signed variables, the iteration doesn't start at all because the `int` gets converted to `uint` and -1 is set to `std::uint::max`, that's unintuitional. \n\nI think you're running into a different problem, and mistakenly attributing it to `range`. It does work with signed integers and I don't see a reason to lose this useful functionality.\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    for i in range(-10, 10) {\n        println!(\"{}\", i)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n```\n",
