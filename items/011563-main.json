  "body": "There is a really useful feature currently in the match expression:\n\n``` rust\nmatch foo {\n    ref mut a @ Something(_) => something_else(a),\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nif you don't know what it does it binds the entire thing matched to a variable, so in the above case something_else will be called with a mutable reference to foo if it meets the pattern Something(_).\n\nThe feature seems really useful but it's currently not documented anywhere, I guess someone should document it.\n",
