  "body": "This is a direct port of my prior work on the float formatting. The detailed description is available [here](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-strconv#flt2dec). In brief,\n- This adds a new hidden module `core::num::flt2dec` for testing from `libcoretest`. Why is it in `core::num` instead of `core::fmt`? Because I envision that the table used by `flt2dec` is directly applicable to `dec2flt` (cf. #24557) as well, which exceeds the realm of \"formatting\".\n- This contains both Dragon4 algorithm (exact, complete but slow) and Grisu3 algorithm (exact, fast but incomplete).\n- The code is accompanied with a large amount of self-tests and some exhaustive tests. In particular, `libcoretest` gets a new dependency on `librand`. For the external interface it relies on the existing test suite.\n- It is known that, in the best case, the entire formatting code has about 30 KBs of binary overhead (judged from strconv experiments). Not too bad but there might be a potential room for improvements.\n\nThis is rather large code. I did my best to comment and annotate the code, but you have been warned.\n\nFor the maximal availability the original code was licensed in CC0, but I've also dual-licensed it in MIT/Apache as well so there should be no licensing concern.\n\nThis is [breaking-change] as it changes the float output slightly (and it also affects the casing of `inf` and `nan`). I hope this is not a big deal though :)\n\nFixes #7030, #18038 and #24556. Also related to #6220 and #20870.\n## Known Issues\n- [x] I've yet to finish `make check-stage1`. It does pass main test suites including `run-pass` but there might be some unknown edges on the doctests.\n- [ ] Figure out how this PR affects rustc.\n- [ ] Determine which internal routine is mapped to the formatting specifier. Depending on the decision, some internal routine can be safely removed (for instance, currently `to_shortest_str` is unused).\n",
