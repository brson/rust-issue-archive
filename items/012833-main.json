  "body": "The compiler will no longer inject libgreen as the default runtime for rust\nprograms, this commit switches it over to libnative by default. Now that\nlibnative has baked for some time, it is ready enough to start getting more\nserious usage as the default runtime for rustc generated binaries.\n\nWe've found that there isn't really a correct decision in choosing a 1:1 or M:N\nruntime as a default for all applications, but it seems that a larger number of\nprograms today would work more reasonably with a native default rather than a\ngreen default.\n\nWith this commit come a number of bugfixes:\n- The main native task is now named `<main>`\n- The main native task has the stack bounds set up properly\n- #[no_uv] was renamed to #[no_start]\n- The core-run-destroy test was rewritten for both libnative and libgreen and\n  one of the tests was modified to be more robust.\n- The process-detach test was locked to libgreen because it uses signal handling\n",
