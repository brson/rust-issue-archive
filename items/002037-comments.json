Also, decomposing into modules is probably a good idea---I've been trying to think of how to refactor the ty module to make it more readable.  \n\nRight now though the patch is running up against bugs in the shape or monomorphization code (not sure which).  Anyhow, I will close the pull request for now.\n",
