    "body": "@brson ah yes sorry, I feel like I often do carry around a little bit too much in my head!\n\nThe motivation for this is that today it is impossible to both safely and in a `#[stable]` fashion call Rust from C. There is no method of preventing an unwinding back into C, which is currently (and probably will continue to be) undefined behavior. The purpose of this commit is make libraries like git2 (which Cargo uses) build on stable Rust.\n\n@aturon and I talked a lot at lunch today about whether this should be safe or not, and if so what it should look like. We ended up concluding that this signature is both a balance between usability and continuing the current trend of preventions against exception safety problems. An example of this trend is how `thread::spawn` requires `Send + 'static` to cross thread boundaries and own its entire contents. Another example is `thread::scoped` only requiring `Send`, but not allowing you to discover whether a panic happens or not. Put another way, this function could either be implemented as is with `rt::unwind::try` _or_ `thread::spawn(f).join()`.\n\nDoes that help clear things up, do you think that a change like this requires an RFC?\n",

    "body": "I am happy with these changes (thanks again @brson for catching these issues).\n\nNote that we will likely want a version without the `'static` constraint, which has a few use cases, but will probably want to be marked `unsafe` and sternly warned against (due to exception safety issues). I have at least one use case in mind for such a function. I imagine adding this as a `_unsafe` variant.\n",
