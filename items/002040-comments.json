    "body": "What you were seeing here -- with the two different addresses being shown -- is produced by the fact that an immediate value that's not assigned to does not get spilled to the stack. So the calls were doing their own spilling to be able to pass it by reference, each producing a different address. Your & approach helped because passing something by mutable reference counts as assigning to it, forcing it to be spilled.\n\nThis is all rather confusing. We'll soon be overhauling the way function argument passing works, and in the process will have to rethink the way addr_of takes its arguments as well.\n",
