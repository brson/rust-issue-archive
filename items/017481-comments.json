    "body": "`_` means that the type is inferred to make pointer casts less painful. For example in\n\n``` rust\nlet addrp: *const libc::sockaddr = &storage as *const _ as *const _;\n```\n\nthe first `_` is the type of `storage` and the second `_` is `libc::sockaddr`.\n\n`as` casts are necessary because they work in constant expressions and methods don't. For example\n\n``` rust\nstatic X: u8 = 128;\nstatic Y: *const i8 = &X as *const _ as *const _;\n\nfn main() {\n    assert_eq!(unsafe { *Y }, -128);\n}\n```\n",

    "body": "@mahkoh Thank you so much for your reply.  However, you would be too busy if you had to answer to every single Rust programmer writing an FFI code involving `*mut libc::c_void` etc (few of them would be able to find this ticket).  That's the point of describing it in the standard docs.  Unfortunately my fluency of English and depth of understanding of Rust aren't enought to contribute a definitive description to the standard docs.\n\nI indeed see the underscore symbol introduces `syntax::ast::TyInfer` which can let the type inferer to fill missing types:\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L1542\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/typeck/astconv.rs#L1043\n\nHowever the language reference mentions to the underscore symbol only in the [section on the `match` expression](http://doc.rust-lang.org/rust.html#match-expressions) and it is different from what we are talking about.\n",
