  "body": "cc #6004 and #3273\n\nThis is a rewrite of TLS to get towards not requiring `@` when using task local storage. Most of the rewrite is straightforward, although there are two caveats:\n1. Changing `local_set` to not require `@` is blocked on #7673\n2. The code in `local_pop` is some of the most unsafe code I've written. A second set of eyes should definitely scrutinize it...\n\nThe public-facing interface currently hasn't changed, although it will have to change because `local_data::get` cannot return `Option<T>`, nor can it return `Option<&T>` (the lifetime isn't known). This will have to be changed to be given a closure which yield `&T` (or as an Option). I didn't do this part of the api rewrite in this pull request as I figured that it could wait until when `@` is fully removed.\n\nThis also doesn't deal with the issue of using something other than functions as keys, but I'm looking into using static slices (as mentioned in the issues).\n",
