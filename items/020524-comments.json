And add some  differentiation between tests witch does not run because they are \"codesnipeds\" (yellow) and this witch are negative examples (redly grayed out text?)\n\nIn general there should be as little negative examples as possible and we should pay attention that the \"this does not work\" mark is not confused with a \u201dimportant look here\" mark by new comers\n",

    "body": "@huonw: I agree it should be made accessible for everyone. I have no experience with aria and screen reader (sounds really helpful) but I think a possible approach would be\n- add color markings \n- change the visual so that colorblind people can see it*\n- add more ARIA accessibility features, e.g. for screen readers\n- maybe make some pull featured on the Forum+Weekly Rust Newsletter to decide between multiple possible ways to implement the previous steps\n\nIn regard to 3 for negative running examples we might add \"a line of ! or X or???\" parallel/instead of the straight line featured above e.g.:\n\n```\nX |     let x: u32 = 888i64;\nX |     println!(\"{}\", x);\n```\n\nor a zigzag line but not sure if there is a good way to implement this in css.\n\nFor code snippets we could consider adding some kind of marker at the top+bottom  of the snipped to indicate that \"there is more\" similar to ellipses in a text. E.g. in gnome3 there is that stripped line at the top/bottom if you can scroll up/down (just as a example, not sure if that would work four this case)\n\nOh and this is a bit far stretched, but for negative examples witch run as doctest with should_panic or witch can't compile  it might be possible to record the run-time/compiler error, and in case of a compiler error do some simple error highlighting in the shown code and maybe add some way to blend in the error message. But well that seems to be a lot of work an another attribute additional to `ignore` would be needed like `should_not_compile` (Through such a mechanism might also be useful to test restrictions through the type system in unit-tests).\n",
