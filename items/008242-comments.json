    "body": "This would be solved by adding a way to specify the path to `std` and `extra`, since it's currently just taken to be `::std::...`, e.g. at the top of the appropriate crate\n\n``` rust\n// in std\n#[deriving_path(std=\"\")];\n\n// in extra\n#[deriving_path(extra=\"\")];\n```\n\nThese would be `std` and `extra` if not specified, so the behaviour doesn't change. (And this might be useful as `#[syntaxext_path]` since other syntax extensions also assume `::std::...`.)\n",
