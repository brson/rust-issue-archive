  "body": "Refactor the optimization passes to explicitly use the passes. This commit just re-implements the same passes as were already being run.\n\nIt also adds an option (behind `-Z`) to run the LLVM lint pass on the unoptimized IR.\n\nThis should close #2812. It is also the first step towards #2396\n\n---\n\nThis is pretty much just an initial \"get it out there\" PR. With finer control over the optimization passes coming later. I also just blindly copied the passes we were already doing, so there could almost certainly be some more work in paring it down.\n\nThe other thing is the addition of the `mergefunctions` pass, which is currently enabled at `--opt-level=3` and does have a small impact on the code size. However the fact that it is at the end of the optimization pipeline is probably not ideal, so some more experimentation is in order.\n",
