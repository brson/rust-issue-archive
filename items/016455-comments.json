    "body": "@brson \nWell,\n\n```\nIt appears that on permission managed windows machines (eg. win7) rust generated binaries require administrator privileges to run, even for trivial case applications like println!(\"Hello World\"); these permissions must be accepted (\"Run this as administrator\") every time the application is launched.\n\nI have no idea how this is typically managed in win programming, but having to accept \"run this as administrator\" every time you run cargo test or launch a binary is really tedious.\n```\n\nUnder Windows 8/8.1 this is no problem as Windows generally adds permissions for `Users` as well.\nBut if these permissions are missing, then you need to always run as Administrator , or add these permissions at once.\nSee [this](http://i.imgur.com/FkLf0ik.png?1) pic.\nAnother thing that creates this problem is the UAC.\n\nOn `permission managed windows machines` , you generally cannot even compile without elevated permissions, and if you do that , then the `Users` permissions are missing.\n\nIt had happened to me on older windows as well. I have no idea how to fix it properly for RUST, but  @retep998 it should not be a direct fault of mingw because I use MinGW with/without elevated permissions , and have no problem. The problem is of Windows. Visual Studio generates no problems as it is made specifically for windows so it takes care of everything.\nThere might be some other factors creating this problem , so you guys should ask someone experienced in windows stuff.\n\nHope this helps as I am also a windows user , and everyone of us wants `Rust On Windows ASAP`.\n",
