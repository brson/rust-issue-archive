It's an entirely separate trait and this sort of design pattern doesn't show up anywhere else in the standard library.\n- It is not required for the standard library to implement this functionality, it can be done externally with no loss in terms of ergonomics or performance.\n- It didn't seem to have enough usage to warrant deciding how to stabilize it.\n\nWe can publish a crate on crates.io if there is enough demand for functionality like this.\n",
