  "body": "It is sometimes useful to parse just the path portion of a URL (path,\nquery string and fragment) rather than the entire URL.\n\nIn theory I could have made Url embed a Path, but that would be a\nbreaking change and I assume that Servo uses this API. I would be\nhappy to update the PR to embed Path in Url if that's what people\nwanted.\n",
