    "body": "@alexcrichton thanks, I expected some unhandled cases just didn't really know what would trigger them :) \n\nI think additional tests are needed for resolve errors inside impls of:\n- `*T` -- `TyPtr` \n- `&T` -- `TyRPtr`?\n- `Box<T>` -`TyBox` (/ `TyUniq`?)\n  These should be trivial to add.\n\nI'm less sure about how to manage resolve suggestions for these, but having examples of impls for them would be neat to test with:\n- `Vec<T>` - `TyVec`? or is this covering `&[...]`? I would expect `Vec<T>` to be a `TyPath`?\n- `[T,.. N]` - `TyFixedLenthVec`?\n- `(T, U)` - `TyTup`?\n- `TyBareFn/Proc/Closure`\n\nI'm assuming that we can't ever have an impl for `TyNil`, `TyBot`, `TyTypeOf`, `TyInfer`, or if we have, it's extremely specialised code that can probably do without specialised resolve errors.\n",
