    "body": "Memory exploit mitigations (#15179) aren't really related to this. I don't think there's any additional compiler feature that's necessary.\n\n> This imply memory (data copies) that should be cleaned with a function like the C11 `memset_s` or OpenBSD `explicit_bzero` (guaranteeing that the compiler will not optimize and do nothing) and declared variable like with the C `volatile` to avoid side effect.\n\nRust already has volatile versions of memcpy, memset and memmove.\n\n> The memory should also be marked as not swappable.\n\nThis isn't something that could be done automatically for types in Rust. The standard library could provide a good module for memory mappings in the future, but that's an independent feature request.\n\n>  Processor registers who manipulates sensitive data should be explicitly cleaned as well.\n\nIt's not possible to implement this in the Rust compiler. It _might_ be in the scope of the LLVM project, and then it could be exposed here, but I doubt there's enough interest to get it done.\n\n> It would be handy to be able to annotate types (e.g. `PrivateKey`) with an attribute like `#[sensitive]`. Rust's runtime could then take care of cleaning data footprints after variable end of life, explicit `drop` call and all CPU registers used. This could be tricky\u2026\n\nThe tools to do this don't exist in LLVM. Rust also leaves far too much up to `unsafe` code in libraries for something like this to be implemented at a compiler level. It doesn't really make sense to leave issues open for incredibly niche features that aren't actionable. Is there anything _specific_ that we can actually expose from LLVM or implement in the Rust compiler / libraries?\n\nYou can already implement a destructor zeroing a type, and it could be done via a custom deriving attribute if desired. Implement it as a syntax extension outside of the standard library first, and then file a feature request if it's being used by enough projects to show that it's not a very small niche. It's not going to be anywhere close to a full solution though, because types like `Vec<T>` don't zero the old location when they move it.\n",
