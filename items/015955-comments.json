I had overlooked that source of subtyping. That said, it\nwould be fairly straightforward to extend the scheme to cover it, if\nwe wanted to (which itself is unclear and should be separately\ndiscussed). Essentially what is required is to introduce a new sort of\nvariable for each source of subtyping -- in this case, it'd be a\n\"trait set\" variable.

I see no reason that the new inference scheme can accommodate whatever subtyping relation we ultimately elect to have, though for various reasons I am inclined to have subtyping only on the object lifetime bound and prefer coercion for the rest. I will describe those reasons in the RFC.\n",

It may still be worth reviewing the \"main commit\" here (which is the final one) independently just so speed things up. Will discuss with @pcwalton offline.\n",
