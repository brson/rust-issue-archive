    "body": "We discussed this on IRC today, and here are the conclusions so far:\n- A pass should be added in rustc::driver::rustc::compile_input before translation just to verify that constant expressions are 1) constant, and 2) non-recursive.  The way to do this would be to set up an AST visitor looking for ast::item_const.\n- By the time trans_const_expr is invoked, the crate_ctxt already has a translation from every AST node_id (i.e., every other const) to a ValueRef.  So, for constants that reference other constants, they can be translated on demand, and then their ValueRef can be used.  To generate ValueRefs for other constants, look at LLVMConstShl and friends.\n\nI think I'm going to take a swing at the constant verification pass first, since I know that if I do the trans pass first, I won't want to bother coming back to the verification pass.  We'll see how it goes.\n",

    "body": "So, here's a question -- which AST nodes do we wish to allow?  There are plenty of things that \"can\" be constant, but would be a huge pain -- consider:\n\n```\nconst a : int = {\n    let b = 5;\n    b\n};\n```\n\nThis doesn't translate obviously to an LLVMConst expression.  Similarly, the following is constant, and even provably constant!, but a big pain:\n\n```\nconst a : int = if true then {3; 5} else {4; 6};\n```\n\nBut, the following should presumably be permitted:\n\n```\nconst a : int = true ? 5 : 6;\n```\n\nHow do we decide what to allow?  Rust doesn't have a meaningful definition of an \"expression\", like C does, so we can't very well just say \"only expressions, not blocks, are allowed\".  Thoughts?\n",
