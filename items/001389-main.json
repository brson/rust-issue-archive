  "body": "Most patches should be pretty straightforward. The only one I have some question about is 0f1713 (libstd: add bytes_reader and bytes_writer). I'm not quite sure if the return type for get_bytes should be [mutable u8] or [u8]. It's easy enough to convert from one to the other, but most functions seem to return immutable vectors, so I'm not positive my decision to return mutable vectors was the right one or not.\n",
