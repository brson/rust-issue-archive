  "body": "3 minor clean-ups now that #9629 is fixed:\n- Update MutChunkIter to remove the `remainder` that existed just to allow the size_hint() method to be implemented. This is no longer necessary since we can just access the length of the slice directly.\n- Update MutSplitIterator to address the FIXME in its size_hint() method. This method was only partially implemented due to the issue. Also, implement a minor optimization in the case that its the last iteration.\n- Update ByRef iterator to implement the size_hint() method.\n\nI noticed that MutSplitIterator returns an empty slice if called on an empty slice. I don't know if this is intended or not, but I left the `finished` field in-place to preserve this behavior.\n\n@TeXitoi @blake2-ppc\n",
