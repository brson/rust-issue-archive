  "body": "- Use range notation instead of deprecated `range()`\n- Remove deprecated `u` integer suffixes used in ranges\n- Replace deprecated `i` integer suffixes with `is` for vector numbers\n\n`Thread::spawn()` still gives `warning: use of unstable item: may change with specifics of new Send semantics` warning which I hadn't found a way to fix. As long as I've found, it's related to rust-lang/rfcs#458 which hadn't been implemented yet.\n\nAlso I encountered two more example issues while going through the tutorial which aren't addressed in this PR: \n- ~~compilation error of first Safety and Speed [snippet](http://doc.rust-lang.org/intro.html#safety-<em>and</em>-speed)~~ (**update**: it should not compile, my bad)\n- the fact that spawned threads are detached by default. Such behaviour causes related examples to be a little bit confusing as the text doesn't mention this fact. It looks like the example was written when `Thread::spawn` behaviour was different.\n\nLet me know if the ~~two~~ issue should be addressed in scope of this PR or in another one.\n",
