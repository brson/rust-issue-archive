What I think would ideally happen is the following:\n- Statics get type checked.\n- For each PatIdent that references a static, that static gets compile-time evaluated into an equivalent Pat node.\n- Patterns get type checked, sanity checked and codegened.\n\nThis introduces mutability to the AST, which is a major change to what the current design is. I'm all ears for other solutions. :-) I'd love to fix this as this is just one of several reports on the same issue.\n",
