    "body": "> Anyway, our precedence rules are set in stone now and won\u2019t be changed before 2.0 for sure.\n\nYeah, I already assumed that. And there are also good reasons to keep it that way :) But a compiler warning might make sense. Something like `-1.32.abs()` could lead to bugs due to people misunderstanding the precedence.\n\nIn my case I was unsure and found the solution by trial-and-error, but parentheses would always make things more clear.\n",
