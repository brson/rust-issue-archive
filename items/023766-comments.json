    "body": "Nice!\n\nIt may be preferable to be the only owner of a `RawFd` with `AsRawFd` using a mutable object to avoid concurrent inner file modification. This can be achieve by replacing `as_raw_fd(&self)` with `as_raw_fd(&mut self)`.\n\nA proper file descriptor ownership passing would save from file descriptor leaking. I prefer a trait-based pattern for `FromRawFd`: replacing `from_raw_fd(fd: RawFd)` with `from_raw_fd<T>(fd: T) where T: IntoRawFd` and return `Result<Self>`. This allow to safely pass ownership, cleanup the inner object (e.g. stream flushing) and handle error (e.g. `fstat` the file descriptor) but require an `IntoRawFd` trait.\n\nThe `AsRawFd` impl should probably take care of buffer flushing as well. The doc should mention this.\n\nProbably the same for *Handle and *Socket.\n",

    "body": "> It may be preferable to be the only owner of a RawFd with AsRawFd using a mutable object to avoid concurrent inner file modification. This can be achieve by replacing as_raw_fd(&self) with as_raw_fd(&mut self).\n\nI fear that this may be overkill for this low-level method unfortunately. It seems like an extra \"safety barrier\" which may end up backfiring when you're in a situation like trying to get a file descriptor out of an `Arc<TcpStream>`, for example. I'm also not sure how much benefit you really get by expressing via `&mut self` because I can always squirrel away the file descriptor elsewhere and then mutate it when I no longer own it (e.g. there's no lifetime of the returned value).\n\n> I prefer a trait-based pattern for FromRawFd: replacing from_raw_fd(fd: RawFd) with from_raw_fd<T>(fd: T) where T: IntoRawFd and return Result<Self>.\n\nI fear that this is also perhaps too generalized for this use case. The trait is intended to represent the minimal step of construction from a file descriptor to an I/O object. It is in all cases currently just a noop, which is quite a powerful guarantee. The trait is intended to be an extension trait as well, not necessarily a general purpose trait. Along these lines I don't think we want to implement a conversion from something like `BufRead<TcpStream>` to `File` just because the representation happens to be a file descriptor underneath.\n\nI think any form of fallible conversion would also be done through a separate extension trait to clearly document why it may fail and be clear about what's going on.\n",

In general we're not trying to create a one-size-fits-all \"create this object from a file descriptor\" abstraction, and erring on the side of being conservative is generally the better option for the standard library. Along these lines I think there's a few downsides to the two signatures you've proposed:\n- `from_foo(T) where T: AsFoo` is somewhat against our constructor conventions where `from_foo` normally consumes `foo`\n- We don't necessarily want the ability to say `TcpStream::from_raw_fd(my_file_desc_structure)`, but instead explicitly relinquishing ownership of the file descriptor via `my_file_desc_structure.into_raw_fd()`, for example.\n- `from_foo(&mut T) where T: AsFoo` is also against our conventions where it takes `&mut T` instead of `&T`.\n\nIn general these APIs are the _conservative option_ here as they are not designed to enable generic programming over `AsRawFd`, for example. These are purely extension traits which are providing new constructors/accessors for types on unix platforms.\n",
