  "body": "`maybe_unique()` allows to mutate the referenced data if the pointer is guaranteed to be the only one.\n`is_last_standing()` allows to check if this pointer is the last strong one.\n\nOne possible application of these methods is a shared resource factory. The resource doesn't know how it is built or destroyed, it may even be method-less. The factory knows how to create a resource and how to destroy it. Upon creation, the factory stores `Rc<T>` internally and returns a cloned reference. Later, at a designated (by the user) moment, the factory can sweep over known references and delete only those resources that are no longer needed by anyone else (here comes `maybe_unique` or `is_last_standing`).\n",
