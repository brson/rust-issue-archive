    "body": "`Stable`, `Durable` or `Enduring` are ok by me, maybe other synonyms? `static` is currently used as a region, to refer to stuff in the read-only segment of memory. While it's true that this overlaps with the word `const` and the kind `Const`, fixing _that_ is another bug. Adding another use for `Static` won't make the situation any prettier :(\n\n@catamorphism points out that \"stable\" often means \"GC won't move it\", though I'm not sure that's something we'll be able to promise of `@`-containing values ever, and on others it's meaningless, so..\n",
