We have a number of problems that make it such that expanded source cannot actually compile at all:\n- `#[allow_internal_unstable]` make it such that macros can use unstable features without declaration\n- `#[no_std]` which is injected is unstable\n- Hygiene (e.g. a macro's local variable `foo` is very different than the outer variable `foo`)\n\nI would also be fine just assuming that tests cannot be pretty printed when expected unless there is an explicit opt-in directive.\n",

    "body": "Ran into this while looking at the compiletest framework and was thoroughly confused. As far as I can tell, this is the situation as of early 2019:\r\n\r\nCertain parts of the Rust test suite can be run in \u201cpretty\u201d mode. This will test the pretty-printing output of `rustc`. One of the pretty-printing outputs of `rustc` is the `expanded` mode, which may result in code that can't subsequently be compiled, that is what this issue is about. Tests that were in 2015 known to work with expanded mode have the `pretty-expanded` attribute to test that mode. All `pretty-expanded` annotations are marked with \u201cFIXME #23616\u201d, but this is misleading: the tests that have the attribute don't need to be fixed, it's the tests that *don't* have the `pretty-expanded`/FIXME annotation that are blocked on this issue.\r\n\r\nI think it was a mistake to replace `no-pretty-expanded` with `pretty-expanded` in #23598, because the test coverage of expanded pretty printing has basically stagnated. Since the attribute is off by default and things just work if you don't test it, people have not been adding the `pretty-expanded` annotation to new tests even if it would work. Now, everyone has basically forgotten about this attribute.",

The FIXMEs linking to this issue has been removed in #133470 as the `pretty-expanded` directive in ui tests have become completely defunct and no-op over the years.",
