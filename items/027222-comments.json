    "body": "It seems like I can make the ICE go away by replacing a member variable \n\n```\nshared: Rc<RefCell<Vec<Box<Observer<Time=T, Data=D>>>>>\n```\n\nwith one that uses an equivalent trait which doesn't use associated types:\n\n```\nshared: Rc<RefCell<Vec<Box<Flattener<T, D>>>>>\n```\n\nSwapping that in removes the ICE, swapping it out brings the ICE back. So, maybe something isn't working great for boxed traits with associated types. The commit that fixes things is https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow/compare/fcb32c5ad120...68ca8e9835f9\n",
