It did not help.  \n\nNote also that when using `RUST_THREADS=1`, the problem does not occur.  I suppose I could believe that by running two threads instead of one, we might be going over some threshold for number of open files.  But given the nature of some of the errors I saw, I cannot be certain that was what was happening; note in particular the bit about `-arm-enable-ehabi` that I noted in the description.\n",
