  "body": "The purpose here is to get rid of compile_upto, which pretty much always requires the user to read the source to figure out what it does. It's replaced by a sequence of obviously-named functions:\n- phase_1_parse_input(sess, cfg, input);\n- phase_2_configure_and_expand(sess, cfg, crate);\n- phase_3_run_analysis_passes(sess, expanded_crate);\n- phase_4_translate_to_llvm(sess, expanded_crate, &analysis, outputs);\n- phase_5_run_llvm_passes(sess, &trans, outputs);\n- phase_6_link_output(sess, &trans, outputs); \n\nEach of which takes what it takes and returns what it returns, with as little variation as possible in behaviour: no \"pairs of options\" and \"pairs of control flags\". You can tell if you missed a phase because you will be missing a `phase_N` call to some `N` between 1 and 6.\n\nIt does mean that people invoking librustc from outside need to write more function calls. The benefit is that they can _figure out what they're doing_ much more easily, and stop at any point, rather than further overloading the tangled logic of `compile_upto`.\n",
