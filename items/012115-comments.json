    "body": "I think that you may have got this right, and this could be related to different arity of `closure_exchange_malloc` between stages (2-ary in stage0, 3-ary elsewhere).\n\nI managed to get some output from `middle::trans`. A lot, actually (~65MB), so I'm just pasting the last relevant lines of it [here](http://pastebin.com/uCj7tXwp).\n\nFrom what I can understand, this is getting stuck in the middle of `std::task::TaskBuilder::addr_wrapper()`, when trying to invoke a 2-ary `std::rt::global_heap::closure_exchange_malloc()` while passing it 3 arguments.\nAt that point, `Args.size()` is 3 while `FTy->getNumParams()` is 2 and assertion is hit.\n",
