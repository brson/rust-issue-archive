  "body": "This large commit implements and `html` output option for rustdoc_ng. The\nexecutable has been altered to be invoked as \"rustdoc_ng html <crate>\" and\nit will dump everything into the local \"doc\" directory. JSON can still be\ngenerated by changing 'html' to 'json'.\n\nThis also fixes a number of bugs in rustdoc_ng relating to comment stripping,\nalong with some other various issues that I found along the way.\n\nThe `make doc` command has been altered to generate the new documentation into\nthe `doc/ng/$(CRATE)` directories.\n\nPreviews\n- http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~acrichto/doc/std/\n- http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~acrichto/doc/extra/\n\nMissing features\n- Different versions of documentation on the same page (all possibly indexed as well?) I think that this needs to be thought out before action is taken. It's an awesome idea, but it should be done carefully.\n- Source links are missing. This is a little dependent on getting versions working. In theory we should link back to github, but we should always link back to the exact version the documentation was generated from.\n- Integration with other tools. It would be awesome to have rustpkg-style inference of the package name and version so they don't have to be specified anywhere. Additionally, I should be able to build documentation for a pkgid, not necessarily a crate file.\n\ncc @cmr/@Seldaek\n",
