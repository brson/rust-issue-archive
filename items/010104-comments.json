    "body": "I've implemented this change, but I don't know how to test it. I thought at first I would start using the diagnostic emitter to print out errors in rustpkg, and then a test could check the error message to make sure it was formatted right (since the demitter can only come from monitor). But, the `@Emitter` is non-sendable, and rustpkg does everything in tasks, so that won't work.\n\nI'm just going to submit the PR without a test.\n",
