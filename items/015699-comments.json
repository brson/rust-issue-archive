So maybe the question I should be asking is: does that make sense?\n\nSubtyping orders are set up so that if `T` is a subtype of `U`, then you can consume a `T` wherever a `U` is expected. My intuition is that a borrow that lives longer is usable any time you expect a borrow that lives shorter. That is, _larger_ lifetimes are subtypes of smaller ones, so the subtyping order should be the reverse of the region inclusion order and `&` becomes contravariant.\n\nBut maybe my intuition is wrong?\n\nIn any case, there's no breakage here; as far as I can see we can either:\n- Stay with what we have, where lifetime subtyping = lifetime inclusion and `&` is contravariant, which I found surprising, or\n- Reverse what we have, so lifetime subtyping = reverse lifetime inclusion and `&` is covariant. (This would require swapping the few uses of the marker types as well.)\n\nI'm wondering if there's a good intuition or argument for the current ordering.\n",

As I've also mentioned, for lifetimes/borrowing a larger region is usable when a smaller region is requested, which suggests subtyping should be reverse region inclusion. \n\nDo you disagree with that characterization?

    "body": "@aturon I don't think that the choice of ordering of lifetimes is arbitrary, since there is a convention in type theory to limit the inhabitation of bottom. If we flip the ordering then every lifetime inhabits bottom, as opposed to the current situation where no lifetime inhabits bottom. It also disagrees with well established mathematical convention for subset lattices.\n\nAnother way to think about it is like this: if you view an element of the type lattice as providing information about a term, then either the subtype ordering T &le; U should correspond to either T providing more specific information than U or less specific information.\n\nThe generally accepted interpretation in mathematical logic and type theory (although not completely universal, e.g. some program analysis papers do the reverse) is that it means that T provides more specific information. This matches what we do today with lifetimes, that if `'a` is a more specific region than `'b` then `'a` &le; `'b` (and vice-versa). This also matches what we do today for borrowed pointer types, if `&'a T` &le; `&'b U` then `&'a T` provides more specific information about a term than `&'b U`. This choice is admittedly arbitrary, but to be consistent between lifetimes and types of ordinary kinds we would have to flip the ordering in _both_ cases, so then `&'a T` would be covariant in `'a` and contravariant in `T`.\n",

    "body": "I had a bit of a think about this. My initial intuition was with @aturon that the lifetime which admits the most uses should be the 'subtype'. I don't buy the uninhabited bottom argument because I think the real bottom is the infinite lifetime (or, perhaps the infinite set of infinite lifetimes), and `'static` is just the lowest lifetime in the lattice which we care about from the perspective of Rust programs.\n\nBut, on second thoughts, lifetimes are not types and sub-lifetimes are not subtypes. I believe we are implicitly considering `&'a T` and not just `'a`. Sub-lifetimes should just be a partial order over lifetimes and the 'smaller' lifetime should be the sub-lifetime and the 'larger' should be the super-, as if we were talking about < for integers. In this view, it makes sense for the longest lifetime (`'static') to be top.\n\nI believe we are misled by thinking of subtyping here - subtyping is the way around that it is because its semantics are based on subsets - the smaller set of objects is on the left, the larger is on the right. That the subtype is accepted in more places than the supertype is a consequence of the set-interpretation, it is not intrinsic to the relation.\n",

    "body": "I think much of the confusion here stems from intuitions that we attach to words like \"region\" and \"lifetime\", even though those intuitions may work against us.\n\nFor example, I like zwarich (and the code base) thought that obviously 'a <= 'b should be synonymous with \"the dynamic extent represented by 'a is covered by that of 'b\".  \n\nBut perhaps that originates from our intuition about the word \"lifetime\" and one person being born and dying during the course of another's life.\n\nIf we used different terms, perhaps the intuition would flip, or at least would not be present.  E.g. \"tombstone\",  well the particular word is not my point.  My point is: Is our current terminology working for or against us?\n\n---\n\nAnyway, even if we stick with the term \"lifetime\", I aim inclined to just say that there is a \"stronger-than\" relation on lifetimes, written 'a <: 'b, and 'a <: 'b is defined to be 'a >= 'b, and then define everything else  in terms of (<:),  Because I think that will serve better when it comes to reasoning about substitutability and behavioral subtyping. \n",
