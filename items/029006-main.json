  "body": "This rather crucial requirement was not checked. In most cases, that\ndidn't cause any trouble because the argument types are required to\noutlive the call and are subtypes of a subformula of the callee type.\n\nHowever, binary ops are taken by ref only indirectly, without it being\nmarked in the argument types, which led to the argument types not being\nconstrained anywhere causing spurious errors (as these are basically\nunconstrainable, I don't think this change can break code). Of course,\nthe old way was also incorrent with contravariance, but that is still\nunsound for other reasons.\n\nThis also improves rustc::front to get RUST_LOG to _somewhat_ work.\n\nFixes #28999. That issue is one of the several regression introduced by #28669.\n\nr? @pnkfelix \n",
