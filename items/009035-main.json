  "body": "This removes another large chunk of this odd 'clownshoes' identifier showing up\nin symbol names. These all originated from external crates because the encoded\nitems were encoded independently of the paths calculated in ast_map. The\nencoding of these paths now uses the helper function in ast_map to calculate the\n\"pretty name\" for an impl block.\n\nUnfortunately there is still no information about generics in the symbol name,\nbut it's certainly vastly better than before\n\n```\nhash::__extensions__::write::_version::v0.8\n```\n\nbecomes\n\n```\nhash::Writer$SipState::write::hversion::v0.8\n```\n\nThis also fixes bugs in which lots of methods would show up as `meth_XXX`, they\nnow only show up as `meth` and throw some extra characters onto the version\nstring.\n",
