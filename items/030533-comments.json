    "body": "@aturon OK, so, I have to go through your nits (and rebase), but the current HEAD of 3423caae956ce8d3525baf3bf5ec7e689339765d builds and passes `make check`. I am not fully satisfied with that code however, but I plan to land it as is and open a FIXME issue. In particular, I think there are a number of questions to address about how to process obligations most efficiently --\n1. If you find that a new obligation is a duplicate of one already in the tree, the proper processing is:\n   - if that other location is your parent, you should abort with a cycle error (or accept it, if coinductive)\n   - if that other location is not an ancestor, you can safely ignore the new obligation\n2. We currently check for cycles when _processing_ obligations, but we should really just check when _filing_ them (as suggested in point 1). After all, whether something is a cycle is not going to change.\n3. When should we update the inference variables? This affects the desire to sometimes use sets and other things. Currently we do a lot of inference updates, more than seem necessary -- either we should try to find one good spot to do them or, if that is not possible because the code has multiple entry points (e.g., select vs fulfill etc), then we should probably add some kind of cheap check so that trying to refresh inference variables multiple times in a row is relatively cheap.\n\n(These are in addition to the points I raised in the intro about better error messages, transactional support, etc.)\n",
