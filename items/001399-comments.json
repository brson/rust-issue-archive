    "body": ">  I think we should probably just disable any 'last use' reasoning about variables that escape into a closure of any kind. After all, the closure could be stored and invoked any number of times, so it's hard to reason about what a last use is in that context.\n\nUnless your changes were more radical than I understood them, only copying closures can be stored anywhere. A 'block' closure an only be invoked (0-N times) by the call that it is passed to, and behaves much like a loop.\n\nThe bug you see probably results from the block being classified incorrectly. I'll debug.\n",
