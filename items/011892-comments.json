Today, one of the major reasons not to use `Result` is that it's really awkward to use.\n\nThe `try!` macro makes it a lot easier to use a bunch of `Result`s in a single function:\n\n``` rs\n// uses fictitious IO APIs as an example\nfn readlines(filename: &str) -> Result<~[~str], IoError> {\n  let file = try!(files::open(filename));\n  let body = try!(file.read());\n  body.split('\\n').collect()\n}\n```\n\nThis makes it easy to linearize a bunch of calls to functions that return results without introducing extra levels of indentation or adding limitations to interspersed code.\n\nWhile `try!` itself is not very common (by definition), a desire to forward on `Err()` (as opposed to `unwrap`ping and triggering a full-on fail) is very common. The ergonomic difficulty of doing so is one of the reasons people don't like to use `Result`.\n",
