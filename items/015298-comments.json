    "body": "TL;DR Use `&'static str` instead of `&str` when dealing with string literals (like `\"foo\"`). The correct/valid signature for your function would be: `fn mkmap() -> HashMap<&'static str, int>`.\n\nBeing able to return anonymous references (`&str` or `&int`) is [a bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/2478). Once that bug gets fixed, `&str` would be forbidden to appear in the return position of a function/method.\n\n> The following used to work:\n\nIt's actually an improvement that it no longer works.\n\n> The error can be avoided by adding type parameters to the HashMap::new() call.\n\nThat second example shouldn't work, and it's probably related to the bug I mentioned.\n\n@pnkfelix or @nikomatsakis may want to look at the second example.\n",
