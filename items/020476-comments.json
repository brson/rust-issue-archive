    "body": "@alexcrichton ohh, yesterday I've take a grip on myself to avoid replying to @jfager as it would be too emotional :smile:\n\nYep, we all know the trick and moreover use it almost everyday. But doesn't scale at all if you have something which depends on a lot of libraries and breaking changes (btw, in the last week I've probably seen more breaking changes than in half a year before) collapse building of foundation libraries.\n\nIt looks like this:\n1. build project\n2. get it failed because of a dependency\n3. patch the dependency in a separate repo\n4. try to test dependency\n5. ohh, well, dependency actually builds but is failing to build tests (hello `regex`!)\n6. what to do now? you can continue working with version which just builds but you know others will be kept stalled or you can patch tests too and create a PR. \n7. mess with `.cargo/config`\n8. patch tests\n9. issue a PR\n10. come back  to your project \n11. loop to p2 \n\nSometimes this fails exactly because of already patched `.cargo/config` as it points to outdated version and you still have to navigate, change the branch and so on. Every action might take a small amount of time, but doing all of them multiple times seems absolutely insane and takes the time which otherwise would be spent on either improving libraries or hacking on Rust itself (especially if you want to get something to be available in 1.0).\n\nYesterday I've opened 7 pull requests for different open-source libraries and patched 3 more internal ones. When I saw that by the time I got to `traverse` and `collect-rs` they were already patched by someone else my though was - ohh my god, that's more than wonderful!\n\nSo yep - I completely agree with @reem that major libraries like `log`, `regex` should be kept up to date even if they are out of tree. If Rust team doesn't have enough time for it - it's perfectly OK, we all understand you have a lot of pressure now. But there are a lot of people out here who wants to help (at least for their own sanity). If the problem is in maintaining control - give just a temporary access until 1.0 hits.\n",

    "body": "One of the worst thing that I did recently is introduce a segfault in one of my libraries after I merged several minor PRs. Travis would have detected the segfault, but dependencies were failing to compile and you can't override paths on travis. It then took me one week to figure out where the segfault came from.\n\nI agree that this problem is incredibly annoying. Most Rust users already deal with 4-5 broken libraries each time that there are breaking changes in Rustc, so adding 3 or 4 more to this list is painful.\n\nHowever since the alpha is in less than a week, I don't think it's worth dealing with this problem as it will solve itself.\n",
