    "body": "What's the B value and how do the results compare with a bit larger fan out? \n\nMy immediate thought was to micro optimizations, like replacing Zip with an iterator that knows to do the bounds check once, but I realize now that the Zip part is common to both alternatives in this comparison. Is this a hint that a simpler b-tree external iterator can be written (maybe without range support?)\n",

Also they can physically only get to like max ~40 depth or something.\n",
