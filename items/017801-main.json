  "body": "I previously avoided `#[inline]`ing anything assuming someone would come in and explain to me where this would be appropriate. Apparently no one _really_ knows, so I'll just go the opposite way an inline everything assuming someone will come in and yell at me that such-and-such shouldn't be `#[inline]`.\n# \n\nFor posterity, iteration comparisons:\n\n```\ntest btree::map::bench::iter_20                            ... bench:       971 ns/iter (+/- 30)\ntest btree::map::bench::iter_1000                          ... bench:     29445 ns/iter (+/- 480)\ntest btree::map::bench::iter_100000                        ... bench:   2929035 ns/iter (+/- 21551)\n\ntest treemap::bench::iter_20                               ... bench:       530 ns/iter (+/- 66)\ntest treemap::bench::iter_1000                             ... bench:     26287 ns/iter (+/- 825)\ntest treemap::bench::iter_100000                           ... bench:   7650084 ns/iter (+/- 356711)\n\ntest trie::bench_map::iter_20                              ... bench:       646 ns/iter (+/- 265)\ntest trie::bench_map::iter_1000                            ... bench:     43556 ns/iter (+/- 5014)\ntest trie::bench_map::iter_100000                          ... bench:  12988002 ns/iter (+/- 139676)\n```\n\nAs you can see `btree` \"scales\" much better than `treemap`. `triemap` scales quite poorly.\n\nNote that _completely_ different results are given if the elements are inserted in order from the range [0, size]. In particular, TrieMap _completely_ dominates in the sorted case. This suggests adding benches for both might be worthwhile. However unsorted is _probably_ the more \"normal\" case, so I consider this \"good enough\" for now.\n",
