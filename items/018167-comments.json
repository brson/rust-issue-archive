    "body": "> Honestly the main thing that prevented me from ever going at this was building the menus and stuff. UI designers wanted :)\n\nI have a couple of ideas:\n1. Add one more keyboard shortcut. Like  the current `?` another keyboard shortcut could open an options panel with some check-boxes. \n2. Reduce the width of the search bar a little bit and place an cog icon on the right of it, that opens a panel when clicked.\n\nAnother thing I would add to that settings panel is the a toggle for **serif / sans-serif font** \n\n---\n\nLike a mentioned in a post on Rust internals, I think it's worth having a centralized place for all the design decisions where designers would be invited to post ideas and mock-ups\n",
