    "body": "I'm not sure how I feel about the specific approach that this patch takes. Maybe we can chat a bit on IRC. In particular, I am sort of keen to the approach of:\n1. Treat ALL binary operators as overloaded.\n2. In trans and in constant evaluation, if we see a (overloaded) binary operator whose types are two scalars, we don't actually dispatch to the trait but rather we use the builtin semantics (that is, it is not valid to `impl Add<i32> for i32` unless you plan on having the expected semantics). \n\nThe advantages I see here:\n1. Most front-end code becomes simpler, because all binary operators are always overloaded, so we can remove the code for handling the \"non-overloaded\" case most of the time.\n2. The type checker in particular does not have to do anything special about trying to know the types of the operators, it can just generate a `Add<$1> for $0` obligation. \n   - modulo if we want to add optional symmetric autoref\n3. Still retains the privileged status of the builtin adds for constant evaluation and trans (should generate the same code).\n\nNote that you can `impl Add<i32> for i32` just by doing `a + b` -- that will resolve to infinite recursion, but trans won't actually recurse. We could also add some intrinsics if that seems distasteful, but it's not needed I don't think.\n\nI'd be curious to hear others' opinion on this -- naturally @japaric but perhaps also @eddyb or @Aatch? I think this change is purely local to the how the compiler is structured.\n",
