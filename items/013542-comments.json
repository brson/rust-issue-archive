    "body": "No. I think what @brson was thinking of was an idea I had to make auto-deref behavior more predictable. The basic plan was to say that we always autoderef until we find a type T where one of the following conditions is true:\n1. The type T is defined in the current module or some ancestor of the current module.\n2. The type T is not derefable (does not implement Deref<T>, not a built-in derefable type).\n\nSuch a plan would probably best go through the RFC process, and it might need some fine-tuning as well. I had planned to do some local experiments first. There are a fair number of pre-requisites, among them #5527 (which I think encompasses #12825).\n",

    "body": "Specifically: can we make it possible to add methods to smart pointers without breaking backwards compatibility for users of those smart pointers?\n\nAlso, is there a way to make smart pointers able to explicitly identify methods that they DO want to override? For example, `Rc<T>` may want `clone()` to be callable so users can write `my_rc.clone()`.\n\nOne issue with my proposal in general is that if I implement a trait on a pointer type, you still won't be able to use that trait with method notation.\n\nIn other words, \n\n```\ntrait Foo { fn foo(self); }\nimpl Foo for &T { fn foo(self); }\n```\n\nand \n\n```\ntrait Foo { fn foo(&self); }\nimpl Foo for T { fn foo(&self); }\n```\n\ncannot be used in an equivalent way (in fact, they are not quite equivalent in the trait method resolution algorithm I already proposed; that's something I ... kind of forgot about and was meaning to rectify. But it's not too hard to rectify today).\n",

    "body": "(okay patrick came back.)\n\n@pcwalton relays that during a 1:1 discussion with niko, their consensus is that the potential cures they could conceive seemed potentially worse than the disease here.\n\nSo taking off the 1.0 milestone, at least until someone proposed an RFC that is actually a net improvement.\n\nIn the meantime, the safest way to defend the issues described here that I can see is to use top-level functions rather than methods to manipulate the state of the smart pointer itself and avoid the auto-deref'ing.\n\nClosing.\n",
