    "body": "Just thought I'd give this a +1 and add that I come across this quite frequently. I even occasionally resort to `once(a).chain(once(b)).chain(once(c))` during some calls to `flat_map` just so I can remain on the stack when the only other alternatives are `vec![a, b, c]` or having to import another crate like arrayvec.\n\n> This is tricky to implement for an arbitrary T as panics need to be handled where a moved-out element isn't dropped\n\nAt least 90% of my use cases for this are for arrays where the elements are `Copy`, which I think avoids this issue as a type cannot `impl` both `Copy` and `Drop`. Perhaps it could be useful to first provide an `IntoIterator` implementation that requires the `Copy` bound, which may be removed later down the track if we're able to come up with a solution for non-`Copy` types? Alternatively, perhaps a `.copy_iter()` that takes `self` where `T: Copy` might be useful until a more generalised `.into_iter()` can be implemented?\n\nEdit: I just want to add that often, `.iter().cloned()` is not a possible solution when your array has a very short lifetime, i.e.\n\n``` rust\nlet (r, g, b) = rgb();\nlet rgbas: Vec<_> = alphas.into_iter()\n    .flat_map(|a| [r, g, b, a].iter().cloned()) // This fails due to an insufficient lifetime\n    // .flat_map(|a| [r, g, b, a]) // This would be sooo nice\n    .collect();\n```\n",
