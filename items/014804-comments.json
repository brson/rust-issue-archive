    "body": "@huonw: There's only one `Option` field among the builtin lints I ported (in `MissingDoc`), and it's not really related to the use of `Default`.\n\nBasically we're just using `Default::default()` as the constructor for builtin lints, because it can be auto-derived for the common case of unit structs.  Lint passes that do have state don't derive `Default`, they just write their constructor as an `impl Default`. You can see this on some of the other lints and the other two fields on `MissingDoc`.\n\nThis is done just so that the `add_builtin_lints!` macro has a uniform interface to initialize builtin lints.  I'm leaning towards scrapping this and just having two macros, one which does `builtin::$name` and one which does `builtin::$name::new()`.\n\nThe reason for `exported_items: Option<ExportedItems>` is just that we don't pass the crate to `register_builtin` and through to these constructors. I could fix this.\n\nFor a plugin lint, the plugin registrar creates a trait object and does initialization there.  If we want that initialization to have access to the crate, say, then we can provide that through the `Registry`.  I think the use of trait objects means that a static method `fn initialise()` won't work.\n\nI was thinking that phase would be an additional field in `struct Lint`.\n",

By my accounting, the remaining tasks are:\n- resolving the duplication between `LintPass` and `Visitor`. @alexcrichton, do you buy the argument that these are logically separate things, and we can de-duplicate the code at a later date?\n- deciding whether `-W help` should load plugins.  We can certainly put off some of the plumbing until lint plugins actually land. But it's already in place, and it'll be more work to rebase it out.\n- possibly changing the syntax for `declare_lint!`\n- profiling (I'm working on this now)\n- rebasing and squashing\n- opening a ticket for skipping `LintPass`es whose lints are all `Allow`\n",

    "body": "I benchmarked this by building stage2 librustc, with optimization enabled, using a stage1 rustc built with optimization enabled.  The time spent on lint checking increased from 0.677 s to 1.193 s, an increase of about 76%.  However lint checking still takes only 11% as long as type checking, and 0.4% as long as the backend.  Ratios for other crates like libsyntax are similar. So I think this is an acceptable regression.\n\nThe [other pass timings](https://gist.github.com/kmcallister/b743360d9f3c63fa095c) remained roughly the same, as expected.  The code being compiled is also different between these two runs, but the amount of code hasn't changed substantially.\n\nThis refactor also makes it much easier to skip lint passes that are set to `Allow`, which could improve performance in the future.  And it makes it easier to run lints in parallel, although I'm not sure the gains would be worth the complexity.\n",

The code is already written and it's not that ugly. The output lag is less than 1 second even on a huge crate, and `rustc -W help` with no crate filename is still instant as before.\n\nAlso the lint plugin RFC was accepted, so this is less of a speculative future thing.\n",
