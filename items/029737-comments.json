    "body": "Laying aside type-safety, memory safety and so on and speaking strictly of the build system and modules, what am I winning in exchange? In C++ I can do `g++ -o app main.cpp xml_usecase.cpp -lexpat` and \"up-arrow\" is my makefile. The `-lexpat` is a wart on C++, right? When I start to add other things to my app like HTTP further `-l` options come along and I have to use `pkg-config` even if I'm using a makefile. In a clean-sheet design that sort of information could be embedded in xml_usecase.rs instead of having to be remembered in command history or a build script. In rust it seems like I have to work harder at an earlier stage, and the idea that  xml_usecase.rs provides an abstraction is not attained as compensation if I have to maintain a list of crate names in my root `.rs` file.  \n",

Not only the crate references but (an issue I excluded from the scope of this report) the `pub`'s I had to add once I had moved the code. \n\nMy above suggestion could help with a general rust compiler pattern: The compiler hardly ever tells me all that's wrong with my code if I am compiling it for the first time after an attempt to refactor it. \n",
