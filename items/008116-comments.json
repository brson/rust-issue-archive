    "body": "I haven't yet audited the uses, but I think it boils down to a task versus scheduler context issue. While in scheduler context it works smoothly, but schedule_task is primarily for task context where we don't want to deal with this. Modifying task-context methods to use a different pattern sounds good to me, I'll ponder what the best design there is. Composing schedule_task with a wrapper that properly handles the returned value seems nice but might end up crude without good function composition operators. I think what I intended is that schedule_task is just a \"piece\" that is used to build higher level functions that deal with the return value, but that vision might have been polluted. I know schedule_task has \"more\" logic than it should currently, it was much more complex than it should have to parameterize it over context. (the copy-paste commit)\n",
