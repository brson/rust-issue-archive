Also, giving llvm multiple optimization hints can't really hurt.\n> \n> However, currently these hints are unneeded for my code anyway, because the optimized codepaths that depended on them did not end up in the current iteration of this PR, so if you'd rather have them removed for now I can do that too.\n\nSo it's not clear that there even were any benchmarks affected by the addition of the assumptions in the first place.\n",
