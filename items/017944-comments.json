    "body": "@chris-morgan Well, what you're describing is not really specific to slices. Tuples, structs and variants also incur recursion of depth that grows with the number of elements/fields and fixed-length slices are really just a homogenous kind of tuples.\n\n`match` expressions get compiled to a tree and recursion is the most natural way of building said trees. There's certainly room for optimisation but I think the recursive nature of trans/_match.rs is most likely to stay.\n",
