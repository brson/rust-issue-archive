Again, it's the difference between the intended behaviour and the _apparent_ behaviour wrt the user's mental model. It _appears_ to ignore the `extern crate` directly above the line with the error, which is confusing due to the implicit behaviour you describe.  Perhaps the message could be clarified?\n",
