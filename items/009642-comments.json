    "body": "@amatus I disagree with your assertion that it is not a useful test. It's in place to prevent access to non-regular-files via the `FileInfo` trait. That's the purpose of this trait: to wrap/automate safety checks. It's a `FileInfo`, not a `BlockDeviceInfo`. The `FileInfo` itself is pretty lean, and is a very thin wrapper upon the functionality that exists in the top-level of the module via free functions like `open()`, `stat()`, etc. I take it that you know this, since you read the source to find the source of the check/error that you're objecting to.\n\nAlthough it's an inconvenience that we don't allow opening block-devices via the `FileInfo` API, it's arguably correct (since calling `unlink()` against an fd pointing at `/dev/null` will _definitely_ result in an error, as it should).\n\nThe use case you desire (opening a `FileStream` to an fd pointing at `/dev/null`) is possible using `std::rt::file::io::open()`. Not sure what else to say, here.\n",
