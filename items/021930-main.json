  "body": "Restrictions on moves into and out-from fixed-length arrays.\n\n(There was only one use of this \"feature\" in the compiler source.)\n\nNote 1: the change to the error message in `tests/compile-fail/borrowck-use-in-index-lvalue.rs`, where we now report that `*w` is uninitialized (rather than `w`), was unintended fallout from the implementation strategy used here. The change appears harmless to me, but I welcome advice on how to bring back the old message, which was slightly cleaner (i.e. less unintelligible) since that the syntactic form `*w` does not actually appear in the source text.\n\nNote 2: the move out-from restriction to only apply to `expr[i]`, and not destructuring bind (e.g. `f([a, b, c]: Array) { ... }`) since the latter is compatible with nonzeroing drop, AFAICT.\n- (I am not particularly thrilled with how I implemented the code that distinguishes these two cases in `borrowck::gather_loans::gather_moves`, and welcome suggestions on ways to do it without accessing the `ast_map`, but preferably also without changing the `expr_use_visitor` API.)\n\nThis addresses RFC PR 533: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/533 (which is not yet merged).\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
