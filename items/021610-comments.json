    "body": "Thanks! I think it's a bit too strong to set the default level to warn for this lint though. We've seen real compile time hits as well as code blow up sizes in the past from just adding `derive(Debug)` to everything. Especially seeing how many crates in the standard distribution are opting out of this lint I think it should be default allow if we're going to have it.\n\nFrom a library author's perspective it's unfortunate to accidentally leave this out, but it's a backwards compatible change to add one at any time.\n",
