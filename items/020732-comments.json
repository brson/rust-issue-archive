    "body": "It looks like this is caused by rustdoc rendering all of the examples with the same id. \n\nIf you look at the playpen js code in rustdoc: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5b3cd3900ceda838f5798c30ab96ceb41f962534/src/librustdoc/html/static/playpen.js\n\nyou see that it depends on all the same ids being different. However, if you look at the source of the StrExt example you linked, you see they all have \"rust-example-rendered-0\" as the id. \n\nI think the error comes from somewhere in here,\n\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustdoc/html/markdown.rs#L196\n\nbut it's not obvious to me how to fix it. I'll look into the issue, but this is my first little bit of work on rust so it may take a second/I'd appreciate insight as to what the problem might be. \n",
