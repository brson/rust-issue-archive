    "body": "@hyunsik I'm fairly sure neither python nor java send the bytecode for the lambda over the network: in java's case it requires the anonymous class to be findable on the class-path when it is deserialised. The deserialiser just creates a new instance of the lambda class and then deserialises any captured values into that instance. I'm sure python will do something similar.\n\nAll of this is doable in rust, with on exception: there's no good way to identify and then recreate a particular lambda uniquely. Java for example, gives even anonymous classes a unique, fully qualified name such as \"package.class$1\", and this is what actually gets sent over the network. In rust, nothing like this is built-in AFAIK, so there'd be no way to find and recreate the lambda on the other end, as function pointers aren't necessarily going to be consistent across runs, or across different machines (when using position-independent code). You could get around that with platform-specific hacks to find the relative offset of a lambda from its module start, but it's still going to be incredibly brittle, with even the slightest change to the application breaking it entirely.\n\nThe best option would be using reflection to generate a unique \"path\" into the program to the lambda, but that would require much more powerful reflection capabilities than rust currently has.\n",
