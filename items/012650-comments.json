Is that right?\n\nI want to keep exploring this direction of pulling modules out of std, see how much we can separate these modules into crates, find out where the dependencies all are, but I do have reservations.\n\nWe should reevaluate what `std` actually means soon, because what it _contains_ is right now driven mostly by technical concerns. We're moving away from having any standard library at all and at the end of this process what is left of `std` may be more like 'the runtime' (or maybe 'the prelude'), hopefully built on top of the more-or-less freestanding `mini` runtime.\n\ncc @thestinger \n",

They can be styled in a way to discourage their use. [On the deletion of the docs from `fn rng`]\n\nFWIW, we currently do display this info [at the top right of pages](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/reflect/index.html) (the `unstable`). It's not exactly obvious, though.\n\n> Can we leave the old behavior in the deprecated function (until we decide to remove it entirely)? Deprecated features need to provide a forward migration path; if the feature still works they can port at their leisure. [On replacing the body of `fn rng` with `fail!`]\n\nWell... so far our \"feature removal path\"/moving functions has been Nike deletion: \"just do it\". so in this case I'm doing a soft deletion, in that it has an error message to tell people what to use as a replacement (this came out of a discussion with @wycats where he said he had spent an inordinate amount of time trying to track down the new name of some silly little functions).\n\nObviously, in this case, the leaving the body is super-easy & low cost, but in general it might be a little insane to keep the functionality intact: at this point in our library development we'd accumulate a pile of duplicated cruft (e.g. if the `std::util::swap` etc. moves were done with deprecation, we'd have the code in two places; similarly for moving the intrinsics around).\n\nI'm happy to change it to just have the `#[deprecated]`.\n",
