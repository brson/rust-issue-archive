    "body": "I'm cancelling the build because I do not believe that this is the correct way to go about this today. We haven't yet removed conditions, and having one and only one I/O interface use `Result` isn't very symmetric with everything else.\n\nI do believe that this fixes a bug in the meantime, but I don't think that using `Result` is a good solution to the problem. If there is an `unwrap` in some of the `std::run` code, then it should become `unwrap_or_else` in case the condition is handled.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Will #10449 change all io_error to IoResult? Then I would close this and just file an issue, since it will fix (or at least provide a good way to fix) the issue correctly.\n\nHowever I think the main issue can't be easily fixed with `unwrap_or_else`, because `std::run::Process::new()` currently must return something (`Process` or `ProcessOutput`) though process creation got failed.\n",
