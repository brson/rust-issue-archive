    "body": "I've long thought that it makes sense to support `{:#}` to get a string repr output (and, presumably, repr outputs of other basic types, e.g. `10u` for a `uint`).\n\nI think it's fine to put this into `Show`. Most types won't need to care about the distinction, as most types tend to print repr output anyway. Derived `Show` impls would probably want to use `{:#}` as the format token for the fields.\n\nI am mildly concerned about the inability to easily propagate this flag in manually-written `Show` impls. However, given that very few `Show` impls would bother even checking the flag, it's probably not a big deal.\n",
