  "body": "Currently `assert!` is used to enforce invariants, not just doing sanity checks that get removed in release builds (unlike traditional asserts). This changeset renames them to `fail_unless` (and `fail_unless_eq` to `enforce_eq`), and adds `debug_assert` and `debug_assert_eq` for assertions that are active unless `--cfg ndebug`.\n\nCloses #12049.\n\nGeneral points:\n- you probably don't want to look at the \"files changed\" tab or the \"Rename uses of ...\" commits; the other individual commits will be more interesting.\n- `debug_assert` etc. are never automatically removed, since not even `-O` sets `--cfg ndebug` (I did not add any use of them to the codebase, and am happy to remove the addition if people think we should work out a better arrangement)\n- This is very easy to rebase (since the renaming is entirely automated), and so can wait until other manual harder-to-rebase patches land (in particular, I'm thinking of @pcwalton's vector patch).\n",
