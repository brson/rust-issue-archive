    "body": "The easiest way to fix this (that I (a non-git expert) know of) is probably to:\n- create a new branch from mozilla/master, say, `shoot-done-2`\n- `git log` to be able to compare later (will just be a check to see it all worked ok)\n- run `git cherry-pick bc584ea` (that's (a prefix of) the hash of the commit that you want) to copy that commit on to `shoot-done-2`.)\n- `git log` to check that everything is in order (that is, it should be your commit first and then the same sequence as from the first `git log`)\n\nThen, if it is as you expect, you can either open a new PR from that new branch and close this one if you do (which is perfectly ok), or:\n- checkout the old branch (i.e. `shoot-done`)\n- run `git reset --hard shoot-done-2` which will (destructively!*) update the current branch (`shoot-done`) to point to the clean version (i.e. `shoot-done-2`)\n- push the new clean version of `shoot-done` to your github fork, which should update this PR. (it will require a force push, i.e. `git push -f origin shoot-done`, where `origin` is the name of your own github remote repo.)\n\n*It's not entirely destructive, one can use `git reflog` to recover the most recent commits to which a branch pointed.\n\nFor what it's worth, a \"correct\" procedure for just squashing the last two commits would be something like:\n\n```\n$ git rebase -i HEAD^^\n# either 's'/'squash' or 'f'/'fixup'\n```\n\nthe `HEAD^^` means two commits above the tip of this branch (it could also be `HEAD~2`, or `master` if the branch was forked from master).\n\n(Just guessing, it looks like you may have run `git pull` which merged your remote branch into your local branch, and caused confusion. In general, running either `git fetch` and manually rebasing/merging (e.g. `git fetch mozilla` `git rebase mozilla/master` to rebase a branch on top of the main master branch), or running `git pull --rebase` will have more controlled behaviour... at least, in my experience, I don't get tied up in knots so much when I avoid plain `git pull`s.)\n\n(My apologies if this is aimed too high or too low, I don't have much context for your git experience. I'm happy to tune it either way, just ask.)\n",
