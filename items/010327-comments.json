    "body": "Quick fix is adding `#if defined(__MINGW_MAJOR _VERSION) && __MINGW_MAJOR _VERSION == 4` at `winsock2.h`. mingw-w64 doesn't define them, defines `__MINGW64_VERSION_{MAJOR, MINOR}` instead.\n\nI think we should prepare a plan when mingw also fixes it. (They already fixed third one of #9246 on w32api-4.0.3.)\nHowever, seems like mingw doesn't increment `__MINGW_PATCHLEVEL`: both 4.0.0-1 and 4.0.3 have value `0`.\n",
