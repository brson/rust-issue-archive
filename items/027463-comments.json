    "body": "This is actually working as intended, it looks like you've got the limiting on the wrong side of the buffering. Conceptually you're currently taking 2 bytes out of a buffered reader, but the buffered reader is free to read more itself. What you'll want to do is probably take the two bytes and then put that into the buffered reader to ensure that you can't read more than that many bytes in the buffer itself.\n\nThe check for `self.limit` being 0 in the `fill_buf` is possible, but isn't required for correctness, so I'm going to close this as working as intended. Feel free to file a PR for the small modification though!\n",
