  "body": "This commit makes several changes to the stability index infrastructure:\n- Stability levels are now inherited lexically, i.e., each item's\n  stability level becomes the default for any nested items.\n- The computed stability level for an item is stored as part of the\n  metadata. When using an item from an external crate, this data is\n  looked up and cached.\n- The stability lint works from the computed stability level, rather\n  than manual stability attribute annotations. However, the lint still\n  checks only a limited set of item uses (e.g., it does not check every\n  component of a path on import). This will be addressed in a later PR,\n  as part of issue #8962.\n- The stability lint only applies to items originating from external\n  crates, since the stability index is intended as a promise to\n  downstream crates.\n- The \"experimental\" lint is now _allow_ by default. This is because\n  almost all existing crates have been marked \"experimental\", pending\n  library stabilization. With inheritance in place, this would generate\n  a massive explosion of warnings for every Rust program.\n  \n  The lint should be changed back to deny-by-default after library\n  stabilization is complete.\n- The \"deprecated\" lint still warns by default.\n\nThe net result: we can begin tracking stability index for the standard\nlibraries as we stabilize, without impacting most clients.\n\nCloses #13540.\n",
