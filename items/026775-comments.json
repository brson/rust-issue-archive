    "body": "I was looking at this today. Let me get specific with the issues:\n1. `extern crate` is always treated as public within a crate\n2. `pub extern crate` was no more public, currently it warns on use, the plan was to make it an error and fix later.\n3. `pub extern crate` does not export outside the crate.\n\nThe RFC is a little vague - it states that `extern crate` should work in sub-modules as well as the crate root and that `pub extern crate` should make it public, which includes re-exporting it to other crates.\n\nSo, I thought, lets make `extern crate` just like `use` with respect to privacy. This does not work. Let me summarise how `use`/`pub use` work.\n1. `use` imports a name into a module\n2. `pub use` imports a name into a module and re-exports it as a name like items declared in the module. Note that in step one we don't make the imported name available as a private name, it is not re-exported at all.\n3. I.e., privacy checking for imports is entirely a function of name resolution, not the privacy checking phase. So when we check that a path is accessible in privacy checking, we check only that the target is accessible, not that each segment is also accessible (because if any segment were not accessible, we could not name it). (Note that privacy of module 'literal's is checked slightly orthogonally to this).\n\nIf `extern crate` were to work like `use`, then a crate imported at the crate root would not be visible in child modules - clearly this breaks the world.\n\nIt seems the best solution is to treat `extern crate` more like inlining a module than importing a name. In this case, I think we get the expected semantics for `pub` and non-`pub` `extern crate` and the only back-compat hazard is where users have `extern crate` in a sub-module but refer to it from outside. However, this is not trivial because it doesn't fit with how we check privacy, iirc, we check from the target of a path until we either get to the 'caller' or to the global namespace, and error-ing out if we find a private module. With the `extern crate` change we have to check how the item was imported too. I think this is doable, but it's not as easy as I was expecting (also I don't understand the privacy code as well as name resolution).\n\nAlternatively, we could probably leave things as is for now, perhaps carry on with the plan to make `pub extern crate` a hard error and fix this for 2.0 (since we want to re-architect name resolution any way, it might be easier to do later).\n\ncc @petrochenkov since he has been looking at privacy.\n",

That is to say, they all should be markable as public or private, and they all should follow the same privacy and reachability rules when referring to each other. If that vision is not achievable, I'd rather find a new consistent view than have stuff be partially implemented. \n",

    "body": "@nrc and I discussed a bit today. My feeling is that:\n1. Like @Kimundi, I too want to make the semantics of `use` like all other items. But that seems like a bit of a distraction here. Whatever you think of `use`, you would probably agree that `extern crate` should act like other items in terms of being importable etc.\n2. It seems like the move to warn on `pub extern crate` may not have been correct, or was at least too broad:\n   - we probably want to warn if you do `pub extern crate` at the root level\n   - but probably not at other levels, even though the behavior at non-root levels IS what you'd expect from `pub extern crate`\n   - we probably don't want to warn at non-root levels because we don't want people to remove the `pub` if they expect access from outside the current module (which I would think is unusual, though it may occur)\n3. I imagine that most people who put `extern crate` at any level other than the root intend for it to be privately used as an implementation detail. Anyway, it seems like we should fix this, but it also seems like a clear bug fix and hopefully one that won't lead to too much fallout. \n4. Maybe the new privacy pass will make this easier to fix? Unclear.\n",

    "body": "I experimented with a lowering approach to enforcing this and it worked surprisingly well - I lowered all extern crates (pub and non-) except those in the root of the crate (unnecessary and also causes problems with the prelude). Getting the details right was a bit fiddly (attributes, stability, etc), but it worked. However, the lowering is user-visible in error messages whenever they name the full path. It also broke some of the hints name resolution gives (note that these are awful from an implementation perspective, I've been stung by them before). Also, because of the nature of implementation, it would be impossible to do a warning cycle.\n\nSo, I don't this approach is good enough for a proper implementation.
