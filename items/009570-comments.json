    "body": "Thanks for the patch! The tests and the code all look good to me.\n\nThat being said, I think that this is a deeper issue which needs discussion before merging. I was under the impression that it wasn't clear what it meant to create a static variable with a destructor. Does this mean that the destructor is never run? Does this produce unsound behavior? Also what if it's a `static mut`? Are there more problems with moving in/out of the `static mut` or is it an even _worse_ problem that the destructor is never run in this situation? (memory leaks are very possible).\n\nI think that this needs to be discussed further to hammer down the semantics of statics with destructors before we can decide on a course of action.\n",
