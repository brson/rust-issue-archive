    "body": "I always expected this to work. I thought we would synthesize a dictionary which performs the interface call, so you'd get two call by pointers.  Something like what would happen if you did:\n\n```\nimpl of foo for foo { fn foo() { self.foo(); } }\n```\n\ni.e.,the vtable points to a version of foo that then turns around and pulls out the proper function from the interface instance and calls that.\n",
