  "body": "Modify the ExprUseVisitor to walk each part of an AutoRef, and in\nparticular to treat an AutoUnsize as as kind of \"instantaneous\" borrow\nof the value being unsized. This prevents us from feeding uninitialized\ndata.\n\nThis caused a problem for the eager reborrow of comparison traits,\nbecause that wound up introducing a \"double AutoRef\", which was not\nbeing thoroughly checked before but turned out not to type check.\nFortunately, we can just remove that \"eager reborrow\" as it is no longer\nneeded now that `PartialEq` doesn't force both LHS and RHS to have the\nsame type (and even if we did have this problem, the better way would be\nto lean on introducing a common supertype).\n\nFixes #20791.\n\nr? @nrc \n",
