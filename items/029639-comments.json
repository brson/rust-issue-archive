    "body": "This idea seems fishy and impractical for me, let me quote @Ericson2314 to elaborate why:\r\n\r\n> If we get core depending on more crates, core might not seem so `core`-y.\r\n\r\nIf `core` requires a certain crate for its convenience features and that crate is small enough to be used by `core` and to not depend on `core` at all, then why wouldn't `core` just include that crate into itself as an RFC to the language as a whole? If `core` depends on such a crate, therefore all of its members are linked to `core` and take the disk space in the final executable, meaning that not there's totally no reason to avoid using such a crate even if it's used only briefly in a very specific place where it's not that necessary which is why people rewrite a subset functionality from existing crates themselves for their specific use case.\r\n\r\nThis is not true for procedural macros, which are loaded into the compiler when `core` itself is compiled but are completely transparent to the final application, but either way there's the problem with the \"standard\" part in \"standard library\". The point of it is to provide utilities and core language features which are useful in a wide range of programs. Now, admittedly, `cfg_if` performs conditional compilation which is typically only used in abstractions over platform-specific code and that is supposed to implemented by a few crates and then reused by many other crates, meaning that the total amount of code which uses `cfg_if` is relatively low. But since it's such a small thing which was found useful in `core`, maybe it can become part of its public API, solving the duplication problem, providing access to its (unchanging!) interface for all Rust programs and promoting the use of it in a wider range of crates, improving readability. **`no_core` would only promote hiding useful macros as private dependencies of `core` instead of promoting those macros becoming a part of Rust.**",

    "body": "> I could see this used in projects that require formal verification - eg. Ada limits it's stdlib for SPARK. But there may be better ways to achieve this.\r\n\r\nImho, I think that it would be good to give Rust some hooks that would allow for use in safety-critical systems that could potentially eliminate the need for a separate core (for at least the basic SIL levels) - which would probably have benefits to the language as a whole. Some things I've considered that would help that - \r\n- `#![no_panic]` being used to classify a any potential panics as UB. This would be pretty useful as a sanity check too throughout the language, `#[no_panic]` tags could be added to a lot of core/std functions for the compiler to verify (this would be useful in kernel space too)\r\n- Some way to disallow unchecked casts and arithmetic\r\n- Some sort of way to programatically tie `unsafe` blocks to the code that makes them safe. I'm stealing a bit from Ada contracts here where you can have a syntax like `with Pre => Name'Length > 0` for a function definition, indicating a precondition to make that function valid. It would be pretty awesome if you could do that sort of thing for any `unsafe fn`, indicate a precondition and make the caller indicate the lines where they check that brecondition to be true.\r\n\r\nThe first two things are basically clippy lints, but they would need to be applied recursively to everything linked. Stack size analysis is another thing, but this is already sort of coming via `stack_sizes`. It would be interesting to reach out to Ferrous Systems and see what the people there have to say on the subject.\r\n\r\nRegarding the cfg-if thing, is there any reasons the implementations aren't just exported from core?",

    "body": "@kotauskas \r\n\r\n> If core requires a certain crate for its convenience features and that crate is small enough to be used by core and to not depend on core at all, then why wouldn't core just include that crate into itself as an RFC to the language as a whole? If core depends on such a crate, therefore all of its members are linked to core and take the disk space in the final executable, meaning that not there's totally no reason to avoid using such a crate even if it's used only briefly in a very specific place where it's not that necessary which is why people rewrite a subset functionality from existing crates themselves for their specific use case.\r\n\r\nIIUC you might want to have core depend on an external crate for its _implementation_ without exposing that crate's API in core's API. E.g., per @gnzlbg, \"we currently duplicate `cfg-if` in libcore, libstd, stdsimd, and in libc\" - even if we don't intend to expose `cfg-if`'s API anywhere in the standard library, it would still be a boon to allow libcore, libstd, stdsimd, and libc to depend on a single crate rather than duplicating code across their implementations.",

    "body": "just writing here to throw in my $0.02. I\u2019d like to avoid libcore in some places where I\u2019d rather not be obligated to follow the license of the libcore code for some particular binary ([this](https://docs.rs/rust-libcore/latest/src/core/option.rs.html) seems to indicate its licensed under MIT/Apache2).\r\n\r\nNow in 99% of cases this is a complete non-issue, but surely it should at least be possible to write a (non-trivial) rust program without needing to do so? It\u2019s not even really documented anywhere that an empty rust program with `no_std` still has a dependency on an MIT/Apache2 library, which might surprise some people, I\u2019d say.\r\n\r\nAside from that (little bit of pedantry) though, I figure it\u2019s at least worth having for completeness\u2019s sake, as crates like `cfg-if` have shown might be useful. If some crate doesn\u2019t depend on libcore, it should be able to express that. Keeping it as a permanently unstable feature might be wise, but it could be just as wise to stabilize it and epoch-bump whenever the feature is broken, seeing as it\u2019s unlikely that would happen too often.\r\n\r\nEither way, I think this is a good thing assuming it wouldn\u2019t be a stability nightmare or anything.",

The MIT license definitely requires attribution and including a copy of the license with distribution.\n\n> Under what specific circumstances would this be surprising?\n\nUnder the circumstances that both gcc and clang both have exceptions so that this isn't the case. The norm for people coming from C/C++ is that \"compiling without the standard library means you don't have to worry about licenses\", and it's surprising that rust differs in this way.\n\n> Having no license is less free, unlicensed software cannot be distributed at all. LLVM intrinsics are still under the Apache2 license, just with some exceptions. Using Rust's core under MIT gets you roughly the same permissions as the modified Apache.\n\nAgain: the differences granted by the exception are what I'm after here. Whether or not something is licensed under Apache 2 or MIT, the point is whether or not the user has some hidden obligation to give a copy of the license and give attribution when it's not obvious. With both gcc and clang, these exceptions mean that someone compiling with `-nostdlib` doesn't have to worry about producing any licenses or giving attribution **at all**, which I was trying to say would be nice to have in rust, since It's a little odd that without `no_core` every rust program requires giving attribution and a copy of some license.\n\nThe proposed solution here isn't \"no license is better\", just that having `no_core` or introducing some linking exception for libcore would be nice.",
