    "body": "I agree!\n\nOn an implementation note, I would recommend using the results of the analysis from the privacy pass of the compiler instead of trying to re-implement it in a lint pass.\n\nOne tricky case to keep in mind is that you may `pub use` an overall private item, and the item should probably still get documented. i.e.\n\n``` rust\npub use imp::foo;\n\nmod imp {\n    // this should require documentation even though impl::foo isn't a public path\n    pub fn foo() {}\n}\n```\n",
