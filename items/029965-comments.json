The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @Gankro (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "That's understandable. Does this stand even in implementations of the `Iterator` trait as the declaration of `next()` is supposed to return `Option<Self::Item>` (which is arguably looks better than `Option<&'a A.` Additionally, there were a few lines where private functions which had a return type of `Option<Box<Node<T>>>`. Should I submit another PR with that changed to `Link<T>` and with the private `impl`s (e.g. `Rawlink<T>`) using `Self` ?\n\nJust out of curiosity, would it be possible to have `rustdoc` automatically display `Self` as the underlying type in the documentation?\n",

Here is what the documentation would look like: [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/hNrMh9K.png)\n\nHere's my reasoning: `Self` makes code less redundant. Its meaning is self-evident and IMHO looks much cleaner. However, the fact that it looks so similar to `self`, means that replacing the concrete type with it in function arguments could potentially be confusing.\n",
