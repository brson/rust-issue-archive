    "body": "[Visiting for wg-debugging triage](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/317568-t-compiler.2Fwg-debugging/topic/.5Btriage.20mtg.5D.202022-10-17/near/304471165)\r\n\r\nSome  questions that we had while thinking about this:\r\n\r\n * What does a debuggable libstd mean? As brson wrote above: It could mean a libstd built in developer mode (which means debug_asserts enabled, and maybe also optimizations turned off). or it might just mean packaging the associated debuginfo for libstd.\r\n * In practice today, pnkfelix thinks the people who want to do this kind of deep dive into libstd itself are building their own Rust distribution. In theory, a `-Zbuild-std` option to `cargo` as alluded to by steveklabnik [above](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20630#issuecomment-445927694) would also provide that level of introspection into libstd (without requiring the same amount of effort as rebuilding the whole distribution).\r\n   * So, the question: If we had working `-Zbuild-std`, are there people who would still want the project to distribute a debuggable libstd separately?\r\n   * If so, is it solely because of the cost of doing the local build of `libstd` itself?\r\n\r\nIt seems like a very open question about whether we would do this at all at this point, and if we did, I suspect it would need to be driven by an RFC. Especially since, from our point of view, it is hard for the members of wg-debugging to understand the scenario where someone \"wants to debug std but not as part of working on std\"; we imagine that the best way to debug libstd is to *make your own local build of rust*. (If the real motivation here is \"it is too costly to do a local build\", then I can understand that. but I want to make sure that is indeed the key motivation.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, as implied by the previous paragraph, I am currently thinking that we may want to close this issue, with the statement \"If you want to propose this, please file an RFC.\" But I want to give other people the chance to weigh in, especially members of T-infra.",
