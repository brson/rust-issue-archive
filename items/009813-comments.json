    "body": "I've looked at the IR and nothing stands out to me as unique to this test case. This is the price of overusing macros, closures, unwinding, not hoisting common code out of generics and making use of reflection (`std::repr`).\n\nBeyond throwing out the standard library and starting over ([rust-core](https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core)) I don't think this is actionable. The standard library just hasn't been written with attention to code bloat or performance. For example, implementing #8981 would cut down on this a lot but it's not an easy task to migrate the existing code base and deal with code generation hard-wired into the compiler.\n",
