    "body": "Hmm, interesting question! I think the reference grammar is correct here, and rustc is not working properly. The rule is that \"statement-like\" expressions cannot take part in binary expressions; I think that should include the `.` operator. I think that the code incorrectly permits block expressions to be used with the \"suffix\" operators (`.`, `[]`, `()`). But there are some weird edge cases too:\n\nFor example, [this fails to compile](http://is.gd/Y5b6QV):\n\n``` rust\nfn foo(x: u32) { }\nfn main() {\n  let f = foo;\n  { f } (22)\n}\n```\n\nbut the error it gives me is surprising:\n\n```\n<anon>:4:5: 4:6 error: mismatched types:\n expected `()`,\n    found `fn(u32) {foo}`\n(expected (),\n    found fn item) [E0308]\n<anon>:4   { f } (22);\n             ^\n<anon>:4:5: 4:6 help: see the detailed explanation for E0308\nerror: aborting due to previous error\nplaypen: application terminated with error code 101\n```\n",

    "body": "I discovered another quirk involving the LALR grammar -- it accepts this:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    struct S { f: i32 };\n    let z = S { f: 0 };\n    match 0 { _ => &z }.f   // <-- note the lack of semicolon\n    match 0 { _ => &z }.f   // <-- note the lack of semicolon\n    ()\n}\n```\n\nA `stmt` can be a `full_block_expr`, which is a `block_expr` with optional named/integral field access operators suffixed (and with optional index or call operators suffixed to the field access operators).  However, if there is a field access suffixed, then the full expression must have a semicolon to be a statement, but that restriction isn't implemented.  The second `match` example is parsed as a function call, naturally.\n\nrustc also accepts the code, but only if the semicolons are added after the two `match` lines.  I think @nikomatsakis is saying that rustc should _not_ accept them, due to the rule about blocks starting binops.\n\nThis quirk only applies to non-basic block expressions.  `parser-lalr` does not parse the code if the lines are replaced with `{ &z }.f`.\n",

    "body": "> A stmt can be a full_block_expr, which is a block_expr with optional named/integral field access operators suffixed (and with optional index or call operators suffixed to the field access operators). \n\nThis statement is not _completely_ true, which reveals another LALR bug.  It should accept this:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    { ([0],) }.0[0];\n    { ((|| {}),) }.0();\n}\n```\n\n`parser-lalr` doesn't because `full_block_expr` only handles the index/call suffixes after a _named_ field, not after a tuple index field.\n\nEdit: I'm slightly off still.  `parser-lalr` rejects this because it doesn't allow a field of a plain block.  If I instead use `match` expressions, then `parser-lalr` accepts the code, but it parses it differently than rustc.  i.e. It parses `[0]` and `()` statements instead of index and call expressions.\n",
