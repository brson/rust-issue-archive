    "body": "The behavior here is weird, but expected. `break` is an expression that has the `!` type, since it \"doesn't return\" (control flow doesn't continue past it). `!` can turn into any type, so here it can turn into a `|()| -> uint` closure. At runtime, when the `break` is \"evaluated\", it just jumps out of the loop.\n",
