  "body": "This commit applies stability attributes to the contents of these modules,\nsummarized here:\n- The `unit` and `bool` modules have become #[unstable] as they are purely meant\n  for documentation purposes and are candidates for removal.\n- The `ty` module has been deprecated, and the inner `Unsafe` type has been\n  renamed to `UnsafeCell` and moved to the `cell` module. The `marker1` field\n  has been removed as the compiler now always infers `UnsafeCell` to be\n  invariant. The `new` method i stable, but the `value` field, `get` and\n  `unwrap` methods are all unstable.\n- The `tuple` module has its name as stable, the naming of the `TupleN` traits\n  as stable while the methods are all #[unstable]. The other impls in the module\n  have appropriate stability for the corresponding trait.\n- The `arc` module has received the exact same treatment as the `rc` module\n  previously did.\n- The `any` module has its name as stable. The `Any` trait is also stable, with\n  a new private supertrait which now contains the `get_type_id` method. This is\n  to make the method a private implementation detail rather than a public-facing\n  detail.\n  \n  The two extension traits in the module are marked #[unstable] as they will not\n  be necessary with DST. The `is` method is #[stable], the as_{mut,ref} methods\n  have been renamed to downcast_{mut,ref} and are #[unstable].\n  \n  The extension trait `BoxAny` has been clarified as to why it is unstable as it\n  will not be necessary with DST.\n\nThis is a breaking change because the `marker1` field was removed from the\n`UnsafeCell` type. To deal with this change, you can simply delete the field and\nonly specify the value of the `data` field in static initializers.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
