I had suggested the name `marker` to @aturon as well as we don't have a whole lot of plural modules (e.g. we renamed `atomics` to `atomic`), but I don't really have a strong preference either way.\n\nRegardless though, could you mark the module itself as `#![stable]`? That'll just apply to the module name.\n",
