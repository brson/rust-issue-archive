    "body": "I didn't expect to have to put the return unwind flag into the crate map. It looks like there are two uses: 1) deciding which mode to use to initiate failure and 2) deciding how to catch the failure in the task start wrapper.\n\nFor the first case the crate map shouldn't be needed since the code to begin failure must call a distinct runtime function anyway. The only exception to this is failure initiated directly by the runtime, which only happens on out-of-stack. The out-of-stack failure is problematic anyway and I think should instead be an `abort()` (#3695, #3555). The second case seems like it could be eliminated by assuming that Rust functions always return bool.\n",

I can try to rework this around the assumption that all rust functions always return bool and we just ... only _check_ it (and propagate it) when we're compiling in return-unwind mode.\n\nI'm surprised by the idea that we'd be maintaining both strategies. Given that it _seems_ to work better (smaller binaries, faster compiles, works on windows, will be more friendly to binding to other languages / embedding / etc.) why would we want to keep the dw2 stuff?\n\n(I put this behind a flag to help with transition, not on the assumption that we'd be keeping both.)\n",

In Servo I would like to not burden every function call with an extra check. Servo's performance is very gated on function calls for some workloads (DOM benchmarks). Every cycle counts.\n",

    "body": "I did a benchmark of return-unwinding Ackermann versus no-return-unwinding Ackermann. Results:\n\nNo return unwinding:\n\n```\nreal    0m2.026s\nuser    0m2.000s\nsys 0m0.006s\n```\n\nReturn unwinding:\n\n```\nreal    0m7.874s\nuser    0m7.784s\nsys 0m0.021s\n```\n\nSource is here: https://gist.github.com/pcwalton/4950363\n\nBased on this I think I am opposed to switching off the DWARF-based unwinding. Return value unwinding should be used on platforms where DWARF-based unwinding is not supported.\n\nThis is similar to the way clang and gcc both support SjLj and DWARF-based unwinding, so it has a lot of precedent. It's also not very much code to maintain.\n",
