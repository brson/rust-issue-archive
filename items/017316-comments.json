    "body": "I started digging back into this. I see two steps:\n- Exporting the stability attributes as well when doing `#[macro_export]`\n- Handling the attributes during compilation\n\nThe first part is pretty easy (I managed doing it by simply printing the appropriate `#[stability=\"message\"]` just before the macro code in crate metadata, as the information is already available to the function doing the writing).\n\nThe second point is the real issue. When `macro_rules!` is processed, in `syntax::ext::expand::expand_item_mac(...)` the information about stability markers is present and thus we \"just\" need to store it somewhere (nb: this is also the case for extern macros with my first modification, so there is no need of handling them differently).\n\nBut macro expansion is processed in phase 2 of compilation, while the building of the stability index used by the lint is made in phase 3.\n\nSo we must either do the stability checking at the same time as macro expansion, or find a way to make macro stability information available to the stability index.\n\nWhat do you think ?\n",
