  "body": "The message of the first commit explains (edited for changed trait name):\n\nThe trait `ExactSize` is introduced to solve a few small niggles:\n- We can't reverse (`.invert()`) an enumeration iterator\n- for a vector, we have `v.iter().position(f)` but `v.rposition(f)`.\n- We can't reverse `Zip` even if both iterators are from vectors\n\n`ExactSize` is an empty trait that is intended to indicate that an\niterator, for example `VecIterator`, knows its exact finite size and\nreports it correctly using `.size_hint()`. Only adaptors that preserve\nthis at all times, can expose this trait further. (Where here we say\nfinite for fitting in uint).\n\n---\n\nIt may seem complicated just to solve these small \"niggles\",\n(It's really the reversible enumerate case that's the most interesting)\nbut only a few core iterators need to implement this trait.\n\nWhile we gain more capabilities generically for some iterators,\nit becomes a tad more complicated to figure out if a type has\nthe right trait impls for it.\n",
