    "body": "> I'm not sure yet the best way to do it. Adding docs to the installer has already drawn consternation for the bloat. I'm interested in pursuing an 'online' installer that only downloads components on demand, which would free us up to package more stuff.\n\n\"Adding docs to the installer has already drawn consternation for the bloat\" Really?.. Hah, I'm surprised in this day an age people are still picky about that.\nStill, surely that mustn't be much of an issue for the standard library sources? I reckon they should be just a couple of few Mbs, properly compressed. I couldn't check it myself since I can't quickly  figure out from the Rust sources which ones are standard library, and which are the compiler/rest-of-the-toolchain.\n",

    "body": "Some comments from IRC\n\n```\n11:22 <&brson> posix4e: there are a few steps to making source easily installable: package and deploy it in rust-installer format, teach the channel metadata about it, teach rustup.sh how to install source \n               packages\n11:22 <&brson> the first is easy to tackle locally. the second requires hacking our infrastructure\n11:22 <&brson> to make source packages you've basically got to add to the makefiles rules like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/mk/dist.mk#L143\n11:23 <&brson> it'll take the entire source, probably as *already* tarred here https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/mk/dist.mk#L36\n11:23 <&brson> then invoke rust-installer to turn it into a rustc-source package\n11:24 <&brson> (though maybe std-source would be better? hard to pull out just the std source)\n11:24 <&brson> once the makefiles know how to create rustc-source they'll automatically start uploading with nightlies\n11:25 <&brson> one wrinkle here is that source is target-agnostic and all our existing bins are target-specific, so named e.g. rustc-*-x86_64-etc\n11:25 <&brson> we *might* just go ahead and stick with that scheme, producing a bunch of identical source artifacts that are named differently, per target\n11:25 <&brson> but that seems wasteful\n11:26 <&brson> i think just calling it rustc-source-{version}.tar.gz is probably fine, but we've got to consider the naming of the existing source tarballs (which is not a rust-installer package), and whether it \n               conflicts\n```\n",

    "body": "Since YCM now provides Rust completion support (through the YCM -> ycmd -> racerd -> racer chain), we too would love to see Rust standard library source code installed as part of the Rust installation. The code-completion experience is sub-par when the user hasn't gone through the hassle of downloading Rust source and then setting the correct YCM conf option to tell us where that is. Few users will go read the docs and understand this option needs to be set.\n\nCurrently we're [adding an error message](https://github.com/valloric/ycmd/pull/299) for this case so that the user has something to go on besides \"completion failed,\" but it's still a shitty user experience. If the stdlib source code could be installed along with rustc & cargo, then Rust code-completion, GoTo etc would Just Work out of the box (for YCM at least).\n",
