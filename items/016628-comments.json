    "body": "# Resizing Algorithm Proof of Correctness (first draft)\n\nConsider growing a robin hood hashtable of capacity `n`. Normally, we do this by allocating a new table of capacity `2n`, and then individually reinsert each element in the old table into the new one. This guarantees that the new table is a valid robin hood hashtable with all the desired statistical properties. Remark that the order we reinsert the elements in should not matter. For simplicity and efficiency, we will consider only _linear_ reinsertions, which consist of reinserting all elements in the old table into the new one by increasing order of index. However we will not be starting our reinsertions from index `0` in general. If we start from index `i`, for the purpose of reinsertion we will consider all elements with real index `j < i` to have virtual index `n + j`.\n\nOur hash generation scheme consists of generating a 64-bit hash and truncating the most significant bits. When moving to the new table, we simply introduce a new bit to the front of the hash. Therefore, if an elements has ideal index `i` in the old table, it can have one of two ideal locations in the new table. If the new bit is `0`, then the new ideal index is `i`. If the new bit is `1`, then the new ideal index is `n + i`. Intutively, we are producing two independent tables of size `n`, and for each element we independently choose which table to insert it into with equal probability. However the rather than wrapping around themselves on overflowing their indexes, the first table overflows into the first, and the first into the second. Visually, our new table will look something like:\n\n`[yyy_xxxx_xx_xxx|xx_yyy_yyyy_yyy]`\n\nWhere `x`'s are elements inserted into the first table, `y`'s are elements inserted into the second, and `_`'s are empty sections. We now define a few key concepts that we will use later. Note that this is a very abstract perspective of the table. A real resized table would be at least half empty.\n\n**Definition**: Let an _ideal_ element be an element in its ideal bucket.\n\n**Lemma 1**: There always exists an ideal element in any non-empty robin hood hashtable.\n\n_Proof_ If there is an empty bucket in the map, then the element after it must be ideal. If there is not an empty bucket in the map, then there _was_ one right before the last element was inserted. Remark that there is no ideal location in the map that the last element can choose in order to displace the ideal element after the empty bucket. It cannot directly displace the ideal element, as older elements win in a tie, and any shifting will stop as soon as an element ends up in the empty bucket. Therefore, there will always be an ideal element. \u25af\n\n**Definition**: Let a _chain_ be a maximal sequence of contiguous elements starting at an ideal element, and terminating before an empty bucket, or another ideal element. All elements are in exactly one chain, which we identify by its ideal element.\n\n**Definition**: Let the _first ideal element_ be the ideal element in the table with lowest index. By **Lemma 1**, the first ideal element always exists. Let the _first chain_ be the chain of the first ideal element.\n\nWe would like to avoid having to perform the full robin hood reinsertion scheme. Ideally, we would like to use the _naive_ reinsertion algorithm, in which a collision is resolved by simply trying to insert the element in the next bucket without considering ideal locations at all. This scheme involves less computation, writes, and branching, and thus should be faster in practice. We will accomplish this by starting our naive reinsertion at the _first_ ideal element. We do this to ensure that we start reinsertion at the start of a chain, and to avoid wrapping issues. \n\nTo prove this is correct, we require the following Lemma:\n\n**Lemma 2**: After a linear robin hood reinsertion, all previously ideal elements are _still_ ideal.\n\n_Proof_ In the new table, an element's virtual index can only decrease with respect to its sub-table. This is because its virtual index will never drop below its ideal location, which can never be less than 0, and the only difference between its sub-table and the old table is that approximately half of the elements have been removed. As an ideal element, the only way to become non-ideal in a robin hood hash table is to have an element with a different ideal location attempt to insert itself in your ideal location. Every previously ideal element did not have this occur in the old table, and since elements only \"go backwards\", this will never happen. Therefore, if you were previously ideal, you are still ideal. \u25af\n\n**Theorem**: A linear robin hood reinsertion from the first ideal element produces identical results to a linear naive reinsertion from the same element.\n\n_Proof_ We will prove this by induction on the number of elements inserted into the new table. \n\n**Base case (`k = 1`)**: There can be no conflicts, so this follows trivially.\n\n**Inductive Step**: Assume that we have inserted `k` elements into the new table, and wish to insert a new element `x`. \n\nIf `x` was ideal in the old table, then by **Lemma 2** it will never be successfully challenged during robin hood reinsertion. By our inductive hypothesis, all the elements currently in the new table are exactly as they would be if they were inserted using robin hood reinsertion. Therefore, the ideal bucket for `x` must be empty, and it will be inserted in its ideal location as in robin hood reinsertion. \n\nIf `x` was _not_ ideal in the old table, let `i` be the ideal index of `x` in the old table, and `d > 0` be its distance from `i`. Therefore, in the old table `x` was part of a chain of in which there were `d` elements with ideal location `\u2264 i` before it, as this is the only way to displace an element `d` indices from its ideal location. All `d` of these elements were already inserted into the new table because we are inserting elements in order. By our inductive hypothesis they are all in exactly the same location they would have been in by robin hood reinsertion. Some of them may be logically part of the \"other\" half of the new table, but some of them may be in `x`'s half. All of the elements that were put in this half of the table still have an ideal location less than `x`'s, and therefore would all \"beat\" `x` in a robin hood challenge. Therefore `x` will be inserted in the same place using naive reinsertion as robin hood reinsertion. \u25af\n",

They do not seem related to your branch at all. I filed issue #16994 describing the problem and a much reduced test case. I think we should workaround this issue and land this PR!\n",
