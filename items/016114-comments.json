    "body": "@namanbharadwaj 'weak lang items' are lang items that the compiler may emit calls to, even if the required code has not yet been defined in any upstream crates. In the case of `begin_unwind` it also allows library code to call into a runtime function that doesn't yet exist. This is specifically to allow code in crate `core` to initiate stack unwinding (which is defined in `rustrt`).\n\nThe way it does this is by relying on the linker to make the lang item's symbol available during the final application link step. What this means in practice is that calls to the [`begin_unwind` extern _declared_ in core](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcore/failure.rs#L63) end up as calls to the [`begin_unwind` _definition_ in rustrt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustrt/unwind.rs#L490). Because these lang items have unmangled symbols, their definitions are prefixed `rust_` so they don't clash with other symbols.\n\nHope that helps.\n",
