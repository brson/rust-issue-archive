  "body": "This commit is an implementation of [RFC 1288](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1288) which adds two new unstable\ntypes to the `std::time` module. The `Instant` type is used to represent\nmeasurements of a monotonically increasing clock suitable for measuring time\nwithing a process for operations such as benchmarks or just the elapsed time to\ndo something. An `Instant` favors panicking when bugs are found as the bugs are\nprogrammer errors rather than typical errors that can be encountered.\n\nThe `SystemTime` type is used to represent a system timestamp and is not\nmonotonic. Very few guarantees are provided about this measurement of the system\nclock, but a fixed point in time (`UNIX_EPOCH`) is provided to learn about the\nrelative distance from this point for any particular time stamp.\n\nThis PR takes the same implementation strategy as the `time` crate on crates.io,\nnamely:\n\n| Platform | Instant | SystemTime |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Windows | QueryPerformanceCounter | GetSystemTimeAsFileTime |\n| OSX | mach_absolute_time | gettimeofday |\n| Unix | CLOCK_MONOTONIC | CLOCK_REALTIME |\n\nThese implementations can perhaps be refined over time, but they currently\nsatisfy the requirements of the `Instant` and `SystemTime` types while also\nbeing portable across implementations and revisions of each platform.\n\ncc #29866 \n",
