At the point we're at now, I'm .. pretty disinterested in those as a feature; they have a lot of expressive power but they interact with a lot of already-overcomplex pieces of the language. Also, IME they tend to bring a lot of headache to maintenance programmers / readers when trying to figure out what code does (for example, in C++).\n\nI think we have a bunch of reasonable ways of doing polymorphic code now that are not _too_ painful, and could grow more (for example, I think we're nearly at the point of being able to write the `any` type in plain library code, using visitors), as far as expressing the motivating case for the bug itself. So I'm going to close with effectively a WONTFIX here, but if you vigorously disagree, reopen and state why.\n",
