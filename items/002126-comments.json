I used the Latest Release link from Rust-lang.org (last updated Mar 29 2012) and changed the configuration only in one way, to use a directory in my /home dir as the installation target.\n\nDuring the upgrade from Oneiric, I upgraded llvm from 2.9 to 3.0. Other than making this explicit upgrade all the programs in my toolchain are those that Ubuntu repositories offer by default, and for example gcc has the same major version number as previously, 4.6. (I could dig up all the exact version numbers if you really want to know.) My hardware is the same too.\n\nBy Rust working I mean I could compile and run some of the example programs from the tutorial after completing the installation. I cannot reproduce the original bug anymore with my current set-up.\n",
