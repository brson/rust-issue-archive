    "body": "At this point, I expect the biggest stumbling block to be integration with Rust memory allocator:\n- At the very least, ASAN needs to hook into allocator API so it can update its internal memory validity map.   ASAN runtime library exports symbols to override `malloc`, `free` etc, when linking statically, and it dynamically detours msvcrt's `malloc` in case of dynamic linking, but it does not handle non-standard memory allocators (like jemalloc).   We could add support on our end, though, by putting [poison/unpoison](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/ManualPoisoning) calls into liballoc.\n- For best results, however, we should use ASAN's [custom memory allocator](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizerAlgorithm), which has extra debugging features like putting recently deallocated blocks into quarantine (otherwise, it might miss dangling pointer dereferences, if the block gets immediately allocated for something else).  \n  The easiest way to do this would be to fall back to using `malloc` when ASAN is active.\n\nIt seems to me that unless we want to ship a special \"debug\" version of liballoc, we are going to have to make these switches at runtime, which is going to cost us at least one extra branch on each operation.\n\ncc @thestinger\n",
