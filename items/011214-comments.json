This only really applies to blocking syscalls like `read` and `write` (which do handle EINTR right now), but this is not true for the general case (I had to fix it for `waitpid` recently).\n\nMost things probably need to just get wrapped in this function: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libnative/io/mod.rs#L138\n",
