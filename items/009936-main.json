  "body": "This should close #9468.\n\nI removed the test stating that nested comments should not be implemented.\n\nI had a little chicken-and-egg problem because a comment of the std contains \"/*\", and adding support for nested comment creates a backward incompatibility in that case, so I had to use a dirty hack to get stage1 and stage2 to compile. This part should be revert when this commit lands in a snapshot.\n\nThis is my first non-typo contribution, so I'm open to any comment.\n",
