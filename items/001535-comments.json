    "body": "Specifically what happens:\n- Tag data is never aligned right now.\n- The shape code assumes correct alignment.\n- So, when walking a tag, shape will sometimes erroneously align (for example when the variant data contains a ptr).\n\nThe problem here is that the shape code is doing the right thing, really.  And it's somewhat tricky to accurately model the behavior of the compiled code, I believe, which does do alignment with the tag variant data, but because the variant data block as a whole is not aligned, this alignment is off.  The shape could have to be significantly altered to model this (incorrect) behavior.\n",
