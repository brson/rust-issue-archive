  "body": "My earlier fix for #4202 would not work correctly if the trait being exported was a top-level item relative to the module from which it was being exported. An example that would not work correctly with the original patch:\n\n```\n// foo.rs\n\npub use Foo = self::Bar;\n\npub trait Bar {\n  pub fn bar() -> Self;\n}\n\nimpl Bar for int {\n  pub fn bar() -> int { 42 }\n}\n\n// bar.rs\n\nfn main() {\n  foo::Foo::bar()\n}\n```\n\nThis is now supported.\n\nI believe this change will allow the GenericPath trait to be exported from core::path as Path in such a manner, which should allow #5389 to move forward.\n",
