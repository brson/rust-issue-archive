    "body": "@Vincent-Belliard -- Thanks for the patch! The first thing I'm noticing is that you're using `while` loops instead of `for` loops. Generally, in Rust, we use `for` loops because they're less error-prone (you can't forget to increment the index), so long as you're incrementing the index in a uniform way. Can you rewrite with `for` and rebase against HEAD of incoming, then submit another patch? Thanks again!\n",

Since there are a few issues to fix, I figured I would let you fix them and submit a new commit -- if it was just a matter of rebasing off HEAD, I would do it myself, but it's a bit more involved. Hopefully my comments are understandable -- if not, just ask (or find me on IRC -- my nick there is `tjc`).\n\nSorry this has turned out to be a bit involved, but if you fix the (minor) issues and resubmit a commit -- preferable combining the two commits into a single one -- I'll merge it.
