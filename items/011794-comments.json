It's not actually a guarantee we provide, and I find it way out of scope of the manual.\n\nI think it would be a good idea to cover intrinsics and lang items there too. However, we can probably get rid of the built-in syntax extensions as a language feature now that they can be dynamically loaded. It might need some tweaking to make it an invisible change to users of the standard library.\n",
