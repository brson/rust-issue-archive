    "body": "This would cause some complications with stack growth since `__morestack`, which is statically linked to every crate and called from every function, calls two functions in the runtime, but if core doesn't depend on the runtime then how can `__morestack` call the runtime? We could possibly have core `__morestack` make a virtual call through two globals that are set up by the runtime, but penalizing core is unfortunate. On the other hand, much of core is templates so the perf cost may not be too bad.\n",
