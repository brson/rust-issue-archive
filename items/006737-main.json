  "body": "Currently, keywords are stored in hashsets that are recreated for every\nParser instance, which is quite expensive since macro expansion creates\nlots of them. Additionally, the parser functions that look for a keyword\ncurrently accept a string and have a runtime check to validate that they\nactually received a keyword.\n\nBy creating an enum for the keywords and inserting them into the\nident interner, we can avoid the creation of the hashsets and get static\nchecks for the keywords.\n\nFor libstd, this cuts the parse+expansion part from ~2.6s to ~1.6s.\n",
