The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

Allowing a closure to run post-fork would be simple to implement, extensible, and allow this functionality to exist outside in crates.io.\n\nIt's somewhat clear from the discussion here that the precise implementation is somewhat in question, and iterating quickly on crates.io is probably much easier than inside the standard library itself.\n",

    "body": "Ok the libs team talked about this PR during triage today, and our conclusions were:\n- At this time we feel that an implementation like this does not belong in the standard library quite yet. We already handle all our own file descriptors with CLOEXEC and handling external libraries' file descriptors is a somewhat niche use case. Regardless, though, we all felt that this implementation as-is would require an RFC for inclusion into the standard library.\n- We were in favor of a \"run this closure after fork\" API which would allow implementing this functionality externally on crates.io in the short term. Over time the crates.io implementation could then move into the standard library.\n\nAs a result I'm going to close this PR as we've decided that it'll need an RFC to accept, but feel free to open a PR for the \"run a closure after fork\" API!\n",
