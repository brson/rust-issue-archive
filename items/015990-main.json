  "body": "So I simplified the code, taking into account the points raised in the discussion.\n\nI added some benchmarks, and verified that the performance improved. It's about twice as fast on the benchmarks.\n\nClose reason (last comment)\n\n> Hmm now that I understand more the code I think I need more benchmarks before changing that part. I need to test with big iterators and big skip ranges. I will close that request for now and think more. I will come back with more detailed benchmarks at least, even if I am not changing the code.\n",
