The\n`make` `wildcard` function appears to be incompatible with quoted\npaths so this check in the makefile now fails. Employing `wildcard`\nhere appears to only re-verify that git actually exists, which the\nconfigure script already did, so I've just removed it.\n\nAdditionally, with the quoted paths the `subst` function should no\nlonger be needed, so I've removed it as well.\n\nCloses #18771\n",
