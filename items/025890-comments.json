    "body": "The compiler is actually correct here, and the `last_path_index => 'X'` isn't doing what it looks like. Patterns need to be constant values; the equivalent you're looking for is `_ if i == last_path_index => 'X'`. Right now all it means is \"bind the name last_path_index to any value not matched by previous arms\", which means the `_` arm will never match.\n",
