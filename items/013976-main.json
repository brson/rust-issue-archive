  "body": "Fix #13965.\n\nThis commit adopts the second strategy I outlined in #13965, where the bulk of the code is still \"smoke tested\" (in the sense that rustdoc attempts to run it, sending all of the generated output into a locally allocated `MemWriter`).  The part of the code that is ignored (but included in the presentation) is isolated to a three-line `main` function that invokes the core rendering routine.\n\nIn the generated rustdoc output, this leads to a small break between the two code blocks, but I do not think this is a large issue.\n",
