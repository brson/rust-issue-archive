  "body": "r?\n\nThis is all of my scheduler work on #4419 from the last 3 weeks or so. I've had a few failed pull requests so far but I think the problems are ironed out.\n- TCP\n- The beginnings of runtime embedding APIs\n- Porting various corners of core to be compatible with both schedulers\n- libuv timer bindings\n- Further refinement of I/O error handling, including a new, incomplete, `read_error` condition\n- Incomplete refactoring to make tasks work without coroutines and user-space scheduling\n- Implementations of Reader/Writer extension methods\n- Implementations of the most important part of core::comm\n\nI'm particularly happy with how easy it is to make the [comm types on top of the scheduler](https://github.com/brson/rust/blob/io-upstream/src/libcore/rt/comm.rs). Note that these implementations do not use pipes. If anything here needs careful review though it's this code.\n\nThis branch passes 95% of the run-pass tests (with `TESTARGS=--newrt`)\n\nIn the next week I'll probably spend some time adding preliminary multithreading and seeing how close we are to removing the old runtime.\n",
