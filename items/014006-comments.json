    "body": "It's possible to build an allocator respecting alignment around `malloc`, `realloc` and `free` by adding padding. Rust isn't going to be able to provide portable SIMD types or an alignment attribute if type alignment requirements aren't respected, so I think it's important.\n\nIt shouldn't be necessary to rewrite all of the standard collections in order to use types with alignment requirements higher than the platform's choice. The `malloc` family of functions is _supposed_ to support the alignment necessary for any built-in C type, but it's a legacy claim - no one wants to raise it above 16 bytes because it would add a lot of overhead. The highest alignment required for a built-in C type seems like a bad thing to leak as a user-facing detail into Rust's semantics, especially when platforms ignore the requirement.\n\nThe exchange allocator itself has no `realloc` function, so it can be implemented in terms of `posix_memalign` and `free`. On Windows, `_aligned_malloc`, `_aligned_realloc` and `_aligned_free` are all available in the C runtime.\n\nThe missing piece on *nix operating systems is an aligned `realloc` function, but calling `posix_memalign` and using `memcpy` is a viable workaround. It loses the in-place `realloc` optimization, but C++ `std::vector` implementations are plagued by this issue so it's nothing new (pardon the pun).\n\n> The malloc implementation can be replaced at compile time for those that don't want or can't use jemalloc\n\nI don't really think this is a pressing need. I don't think there's a use case for using libc malloc instead of jemalloc, because it's portable to the same platforms as Rust. Debian and Fedora want us to provide an `--external-jemalloc` switch making use of a `libjemalloc.so` / `libjemalloc.a` provided by the system. They'll want the same thing for LLVM, libuv and any other third party dependency including libbacktrace and compiler-rt.\n",
