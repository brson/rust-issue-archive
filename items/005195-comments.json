    "body": "Just some notes (which I'm sure the current participants are already aware of, this is more for general reviewers):\n-  We do already implement `IterBytes` on a large set of tuple types (see `std::to_bytes`).  This may not be as satisfying as providing a generic implementation for all possible tuple types, but we do not really have the capability to express that yet.  (The latter is related to the variadic generics RFC: #10124)\n- We also provide `IterBytes` for `&[A]` and `~[A]`, but not for other containers.  We do not yet have a container trait that provides a way to iterate over all of the container's contents, so presumably the implicit goal here is to have the built-in containers (like `HashMap`, `HashSet` and `TrieMap`) implement `IterBytes`, but utilizing @thestinger's hypothesized method for combining hashes.  (Maybe the stuff in `libcollections` too, not sure.)  Or maybe I misunderstand the goal here.\n",
