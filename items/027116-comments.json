    "body": ":disappointed: those fat arrows.. It seems to me that it'd be possible to do a syntax that is very very similar to Rust's primary syntax but where all braces and semicolons are optional(or, only used when needed, EG, when indentation isn't sufficient)\n\nOne of the reasons the current situation makes this difficult:\nA naive solution would parse\n\n``` rust\nfn do_things(a:u32 b:u32)-> u32 { a*b + a }\nfn main()\n    do_things(1 2)\n    do_things(3 4)\n```\n\ninto\n\n``` rust\nfn do_things(a:u32, b:u32)-> u32 { a*b + a }\nfn main(){\n    do_things(1, 2);\n    do_things(3, 4)\n}\n```\n\nSee how it leaves the last statement of a block without a semicolon to make sure it gets returned. Unfortuantely, there are many cases where we do want to return something and many cases where we don't. This is a case where we don't, and because do_things(3,4) returns a non-unit value we get a compilation error, main wants a unit at the end, do_things didn't give it one without the semicolon.\n\nI read somewhere that allowing all types to coerce to unit had been considered(tried, even?), but it was rejected. Having difficulty finding the discussion. I can't see why it's considered useful to tell the programmer off for leaving the semicolon off of the last (non-unit)expression in a block that returns unit. For every case where a programmer wrongly expects the last expression to transmit its value out of the block, there is a receiver. If the transmission is interrupted by a coercion to unit, the error will be pointed out at the receiver's end, when it gets unit instead of whatever it was expecting. Requiring it to be pointed out at the transmitter's doesn't seem helpful.\n",
