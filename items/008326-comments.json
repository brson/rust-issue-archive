    "body": "I'm obviously very much against removing `.times()`. The method is intended for dead-simple repetition, and to provide trivial examples of `do` notation, higher-order functions, and implementing methods on \"builtin\" types. It's great for tutorials and small examples. In short, it's good PR, and good PR is very important. `for _ in range(0, x)` is a poor replacement for these purposes. `times` is also 12 lines of code total: in other words, no maintenance burden whatsoever.\n\nConstant allegations of cuteness aside, `.times` is found in hundreds of places thoughout the compiler. We'd always had the ability to write `for range(0, x) |_| {`, and yet people still elected to use `.times` instead. That alone should be evidence of its utility.\n\nr- from me\n",

It won't be any longer than `do` is with `Times` right now. You could consider this to a temporary bit of ugliness like `advance` was.\n\nThere's nothing to gain from having an alternate way of looping lacking a way to break and making you encounter closure capture errors. There is a cognitive overhead to have many different looping conventions in the standard library - `Times` doesn't even implement the _old_ internal iterator protocol that's still cluttered around.\n",

That way once there's sugar for not capturing any patterns you'd still have the same syntax `for 4.times { ... }`?

    "body": "@alexcrichton: yeah, it could just be a wrapper around `range(start, stop)` doing `range(0, stop)` but it would be a function rather than a method. It would be odd to stick a `times` method on anything implementing `Add` + `Ord` - `Times` isn't implemented generically and doesn't work on anything but `uint` (including unsigned big integers).\n\nWe used used to have a `repeat` internal iterator doing the same thing as `Times`, but `repeat` is going to repeat a value forever now.\n\nI decided just to copy Python's convention for now because `times(i)` doesn't make sense in the way that `i.times` does.\n",

It runs the risk of the same off-by-one errors that C's `for` is vulnerable to.\n\nAs for implementation, I really don't care. My only concern is the API. I agree that `times(i)` would be pointless, as one of the driving forces for the `x.times` approach was to avoid having to add a name to the universal namespace.\n\nHonestly I don't care if it gets used in the compiler, so I'm still indifferent to the bulk of this PR. But I do insist that this API be made available, whether with `for` or `do`.\n",
