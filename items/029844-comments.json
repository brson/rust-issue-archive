    "body": "Hi, I discovered this regression as I was fiddling around with one of my projects, and therefore I'm pretty motivated to try and fix it as it currently prevents me from continuing. I took a look at where the error was reported inside `dropck.rs` and was quickly overwhelmed by the logic and complexity, however I would like to have a crack at some sort of (hacky) fix.\n\n@arielb1 the 'unification system for regions' sounds pretty complex, but if it is possible to explain the workings of that to a mere mortal like me then I'd be happy to do the 'plumbing' work on any implementation.\n\nAlso I find I solve problems a lot by visualising the data etc, and I was wondering how you handle debugging. I've recently switched from 'managed' languages like Java and I really miss the complete runtime inspection capabilities of something like the IntelliJ idea debugger. Is it possible to use `gdb` for that or do you just resort to a bunch of `println!(\"{:?}\", foo);` statements everywhere?\n",

    "body": "@arielb1 yes, I've encountered this problem, but I am not sure what answer I prefer. A unification system for regions is one thing I considered, along with an alternate scheme for inferring substitutions. I had the latter up and working (I can't find the branch just now) but was dissatisfied with it in some ways that I don't remember now -- the main thing was that instead of creating fresh type variables for every impl parameter, it would first try to deduce the values for the type variables by looking at the trait reference. e.g., if we had `impl<T> Foo<T> for i32`, and the trait reference was `Foo<u32> for i32`, we would not make a variable `$T` that gets unified with `u32`, we'd just compute a substitution `T=u32` first off. In some cases, we had to fall back to unification variables (e.g., projections). \n",
