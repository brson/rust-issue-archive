    "body": "My backup plan would have been to lex multiple line doc comments with only non-`\\n` spaces between them as a single token, so that interior `///`-lines wouldn't ever appear on their own, but that's somewhat more complex and maybe a tad unorthodox.\n\nThis is (I think) my first non-docs non-examples non-formatting pull request, please bear with me if I'm doing it wrong. Tests still pass and it seems to work out and there's some amount of generated docs that are better formatted/have better summary vs rest of info splits, and no formatting 'regressions' that I could spot.\n",
