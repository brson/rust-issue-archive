    "body": "You are correct that this is a bug (in fact, a duplicate of #6268). \n\nMoving the inner call out into a temporary is the recommended fix.\n\n(Random comment: using `println!(\"{}\", x)` will be marginally higher performance than `println(format!(...))` (and it looks neater), since the former can effectively write straight to stdout, while the latter has to write to an allocated string and then write the string to stdout.)\n",
