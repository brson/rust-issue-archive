    "body": "This is likely a symptom of this terrible, terrible bug: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/3660\n\nThe problem is that there are two sets of libraries installed, and we rely on the assumption that they are identical when configuring the `$PATH` environment variable, but that assumption has turned out not to be true for unknown reasons.\n\nOne possible terrible, terrible workaround is to add something like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\rust\\bin\\rustc\\i686-pc-mingw\\bin` (verify that path on your own install) to the front of `$PATH`, but _only when running the executable_ (not when running the compiler). That should dynamically load the library with the correct symbol. Alternately, you could just copy the files in that directory to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\rust\\bin`, which would make the two sets of libraries the same. It's a mess, sadly.\n\nI'm not sure what the state of Rust syntax highlighting on GitHub is, but here is the issue: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/4341.\n",
