  "body": "We provide tools to tell what exact symbols to emit for any fn or static, but\ndon\u2019t quite check if that won\u2019t cause any issues later on. Some of the issues\ninclude LLVM mangling our names again and our names pointing to wrong locations,\nus generating dumb foreign call wrappers, linker errors, extern functions\nresolving to different symbols altogether (`extern {fn fail();} fail();` in some\ncases calling `fail1()`), etc.\n\nBefore the commit we had a function called `note_unique_llvm_symbol`, so it is\nclear somebody was aware of the issue at some point, but the function was barely\nused, mostly in irrelevant locations.\n\nAlong with working on it I took liberty to start refactoring trans/base into\na few smaller modules. The refactoring is incomplete and I hope I will find some\nmotivation to carry on with it.\n\nThis is possibly a [breaking-change] because it makes dumbly written code\nproperly invalid.\n\nThis fixes all those issues about incorrect use of #[no_mangle] being not reported/misreported/ICEd by the compiler.\n\nNB. This PR does not attempt to tackle the parallel codegen issue that was mentioned in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22811, but I believe it should be very straightforward in a follow up PR by modifying `trans::declare::get_defined_value` to look at all the contexts.\n\ncc @alexcrichton @huonw @nrc because you commented on the original RFC issue.\n\nEDIT: wow, this became much bigger than I initially intended.\n",
