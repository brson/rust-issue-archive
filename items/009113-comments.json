    "body": "@nikomatsakis One solution finally came to me today.  Rather than try to generalize the borrow checker, we could instead generalize the hashmap API accordingly.  In short, when in doubt, try Continuation-Passing-Style.  :)\n\nThree step plan:\n1. Sketch a new CPS style function for hashmap API,\n2. Use the CPS style function to implement the goal function,\n3. Prove the CPS style function can itself actually be implemented.\n\nThe gory details:\n\n1) We add (at least) one new function, `find_or_fallback_with` to hashmap.rs (and possibly also to the Map trait).  \nSignature:\n\n``` rust\n    pub fn find_or_fallback_with<'a,A,T>(\n        &'a mut self,\n        k: K,\n        a: A,\n        found: &fn(&K, &'a mut V, A) -> T,\n        fallback: &fn(&'a mut HashMap<K, V>, &K, A) -> T) -> T;\n```\n\nThe crucial detail is that, upon failure, we _pass along_ the `&'a mut` ref to the hashmap _along_ to the fallback, so that the closure can update it accordingly in that narrowed scope.\n\n---\n\n2) Skipping ahead to the fun stuff, here's what @zeux's function now looks like:\n\n``` rust\n    pub fn read3<'a>(&'a mut self, key: int) -> Option<&'a Data> {\n        self.cache.find_or_fallback_with(\n            key,\n            (),\n\n            // found:\n            |_key, data, _a| { let data : &'a Data = data; Some(data) },\n\n            // fallback:\n            |cache, _key, _a| {\n                match self.db.find(&key) {\n                    Some(data) => {\n                        let result: &Data = cache.find_or_insert(key, data.clone());\n                        Some(result)\n                    },\n                    None => None\n                }\n            })\n    }\n\n```\n\n(We might clean this up via `do` or some such, not sure, my initial experiments with `do` did not look too great since the found closure is not quite trivial enough to be a single expression.)\n\n---\n\n3) Just to complete the whole picture, here is the `find_or_fallback_with` function we'd have to add to hashmap.rs:\n\n(But its a direct adaptation of the existing `mangle` function; we'd presumably want to try to unify the two internally to hashmap.rs if possible.)\n\n``` rust\n    pub fn find_or_fallback_with<'a,A,T>(\n        &'a mut self,\n        k: K,\n        a: A,\n        found: &fn(&K, &'a mut V, A) -> T,\n        fallback: &fn(&'a mut HashMap<K, V>, &K, A) -> T) -> T {\n        if self.size >= self.resize_at {\n            // n.b.: We could also do this after searching, so\n            // that we do not resize if this call to insert is\n            // simply going to update a key in place.  My sense\n            // though is that it's worse to have to search through\n            // buckets to find the right spot twice than to just\n            // resize in this corner case.\n            self.expand();\n        }\n\n        let hash = k.hash_keyed(self.k0, self.k1) as uint;\n        match self.bucket_for_key_with_hash(hash, &k) {\n            TableFull => fail!(\"Internal logic error\"),\n            FoundEntry(idx) => {\n                found(&k, self.mut_value_for_bucket(idx), a)\n            }\n            FoundHole(_) => {\n                fallback(self, &k, a)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\n(Obviously I did not need the accumulator `A` parameter for this example, but I figure better to follow the precedent set by `mangle` and include that here.)\n",

    "body": ">  For me borrow checks add enough extra burden in terms of thinking about the code that the better borrowck works the happier I am.\n\nIn my opinion: this _is_ the argument for the CPS solution.  Complicating the borrow-checker rules would not solve the problem of it being hard to understand the reasoning of the borrow-checker.  Conversely, the CPS solution (idiomatic or not), enables the borrow-checker (and thus the human being reasoning _about_ the borrow checker), to explain the borrow checker's reasoning in terms of lexical scopes.  (End of \"In my opinion.\")\n\nHaving said all that, I'm pretty sure that @nikomatsakis and others have made the argument in the past that we do want to support idioms much like the one zeux described.  So we will see.\n\n(My main goal was to prove to myself that one can still express the desired control flow here, given the appropriate library API.)\n",

    "body": "From my perspective (take everything that I'm saying with a grain of salt, I'm very new to Rust) it's about simplifying borrowck behavior (even if it requires complicating borrowck logic).\n\nIn the None arm, there is no accessible borrowed pointer that came from borrowing mut self. So for the user (me), it does not make much sense that the code does not compile.\n\nI would go so far as to say that in the Some arm, removing the _usage_ of the value should let us borrow mut self again - since in some cases it will be important (i.e. if I'm returning Option<(&Chunk, float)>, but I'm only interested in the float part in Some branch - I want to be able to borrow mut self again.\n\nThis is my opinion as a user; the call is obviously yours, but I hope the opinion is useful :)\n",
