Otherwise ...\", AFAICT we are not actually jumping when the cursor is at the beginning of the line.\n\n(At least not when the content on this line is properly aligned -- maybe its just muscle memory, but I expect the cursor to jump to the indentation column when I hit tab from the beginning of the line, regardless of whether the current content is already properly aligned or not.)\n\nI've been getting mixed results when attempting to narrow this down.  (earlier I had thought that the problem might be an artifact of my use of a beta version of emacs, but now I'm seeing the same issue even with a release version of emacs.)  I will try to investigate and file a proper bug.\n",
