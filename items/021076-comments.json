    "body": "> We might want to shrink the default buffer size as well. 64k is pretty\n> huge. Java uses 8k by default, and Go uses 4k for reference.\n\nMy dim recollection is that it's 64k because the libuv project determined that, when reading from a local file, reading in 64k chunks provided the fastest throughput in the general case.\n\nThat said, if `BufferedReader` is being used for reading things that aren't files, it does seem perhaps overly large.\n\nPerhaps it makes sense to split `new()` into two functions, `new_large()` and `new_small()`, where `new_large()` is 64k and `new_small()` is 4k. I'm proposing this rather than keeping the name `new()` because I think it makes sense to require the user to think about which size is more appropriate.\n",
