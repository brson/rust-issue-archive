  "body": "The default buffer size is the same as the one in Java's BufferedWriter.\n\nWe may want BufferedWriter to have a Drop impl that flushes, but that\nisn't possible right now due to #4252/#4430. This would be a bit\nawkward due to the possibility of the inner flush failing. For what it's\nworth, Java's BufferedReader doesn't have a flushing finalizer, but that\nmay just be because Java's finalizer support is awful.\n\nThe current implementation of BufferedStream is weird in my opinion, but\nit's what the discussion in #8953 settled on.\n\nI wrote a custom copy function since vec::copy_from doesn't optimize as\nwell as I would like.\n\nCloses #8953\n",
