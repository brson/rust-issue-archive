(@anchovieshat, I've been trying to reach you about this, but was unsuccessful.) This PR more thoroughly and conservatively addresses tests, as well as a few other details.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton My worry about that is that, in my main branch for the I/O work, I'm dismantling the rtio infrastructure and coupling `std::io` directly to the new `platform_imp` infrastructure instead. I'm hoping to start landing some of those changes in the near future. So I'm not sure how viable an rtio-based migration path is, even in the short term.\n\nIn the long term, the only way to keep green-threaded I/O alive is to essentially fork `std::io` and do work similarly to what I'm doing now, but coupling to `librustuv` instead. That seems like a large investment, and certainly something I have a hard time seeing happening in the next months. What are your thoughts on the long-term picture?\n",
