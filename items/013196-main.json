  "body": "Move EnumSet to libstd\n\nThis moves EnumSet into libstd and updates everything else in core that uses it.\n\nThis is the beginning of an attempt to fix #6085\n\nObviously, this will break any code that attempts to access `enum_set` as\n`collections::enum_set`, requiring a simple update (What's the mechanism to\ncommunicate that? ping @cwm to put it in This Week in Rust?)\n\nRight now I've left it as multiple commits to make it easier to look over if there are\nthings I need to fix, I'll squash this if it's ok to merge.\n\nEDIT: This also is somewhat an extension of #12415 \n",
