I remember it stripping out metadata, but there are indeed ways to get around that, so perhaps I didn't dig enough.\n",

Making binaries smaller will require altering the design of the standard library, as using link-time optimization strips out even more than `--gc-sections` with function sections but doesn't result in binaries anywhere near the size you can get with C or C++.\n",
