    "body": "If a panic occurs while a mutable borrow exists, currently only `Drop` implementations have to worry about seeing an inconsistent state (\"panic safety\").\n\nThe combination of `catch_panic` + TLS + `RefCell` allows using an object even after a panic occurred in a mutating operation.\nDoes this mean all other Rust code now has to worry about panic safety, too? Or do we require that types like `RefCell` use poisoning?\n\nIn the latter case, the `'static` bound is still necessary to prevent mutating objects that remain accessible after the panic was caught. The `Send` bound seems unnecessary in both cases.\n\nFrom the point of view of FFI callbacks (the primary consumer of this API): the `'static` bound is harmless as the FFI interface is dealing with raw pointers. But the `Send` bound is annoying, given that raw pointers don't directly implement `Send`. The easiest fix would be to create my high-level wrapper type around the raw pointer before using `catch_panic`, but that means I get undefined behavior if the constructor function of the wrapper type panics...\n\nAlso, `rt::unwind` is still documented as \"This is not safe to call in a nested fashion.\". Is that just outdated documentation, or is it undefined behavior to nest `catch_panic` calls?\n",
