    "body": "The problem is that `librusti.so` is just a 0-byte placeholder file used by the build system to manage dependencies. Rust libraries have names like `librusti-[hex]-[vers].so`, and the hex string in the middle is not a stable identifier, so we use the names without all the gunk just so `make` can identify the dependencies.\n\nWe should not be installing these files. One thing we could do to solve this easily might be to name these something like `librusti.so.dummy` (this is what servo does).\n\nThese files have caused confusion before.\n",

To do this you'll want to use the `--prefix=/usr` flag to `configure`, and not just copy the files. There are some behaviors related to library loading that base their paths on the configured prefix, so things could break in subtle ways if you simply copy the installed files to a different location.\n",

    "body": "Yes, absolutely you may, though I'm not sure exactly what you intend. I think the proper way to do this is to modify [this bit of the makefiles](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/incoming/Makefile.in#L127) that controls library naming. That `CFG_LIB_NAME` macro produces the name of a library as appropriate for the target architecture, e.g. `librust.so`. Adding `.dummy` to those definitions (except for `CFG_RUNTIME` and `CFG_RUSTLLVM`, which are native libraries, not Rust crates) will _probably_ do what we want. Additionally the rules for `make clean` in `mk/clean.mk` will need to be changed to account for the new extension.\n",
