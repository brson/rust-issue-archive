  "body": "This is just a small change to make the tt quasiquoter quote ~[token_tree] vectors, rather than token_tree values. It is less efficient this way but it seems like the only sensible interpretation given the semantics of token trees: their nesting is mostly incidental and doesn't actually represent the expression or item structure (for example: `if foo { ... }` is three token-trees, despite being one expression).\n\nr? @brson\n",
