    "body": "I think the main change we want is to add child pointers so that no operation (including iterator construction) requires allocating a search stack. This is the approach taken in Google's BTree implementation, which to my knowledge is the state of the art: https://code.google.com/p/cpp-btree/\n\nNote that in-memory and on-disk BTrees have different performance constraints. Though the similarity between CPU cache and file system block access certainly makes them _similar_, the order of magnitude means disk BTrees can basically do _anything_ to avoid touching different blocks of disk, while an in-memory BTree may prefer touching more cache lines to avoid other expensive actions like allocating memory.\n",

    "body": "Oh actually I just remembered the key problem that B+-Trees have which probably makes them completely inappropriate for Rust: they require you to duplicate keys. This is a non-starter in Rust because of ownership. If your keys are Vec's or, like, Files, you can't just indiscriminately duplicate them. _Especially_ if you have internal mutability, because then it's possible for a user of your collection to \"desynchronize\" the different copies of the keys.\n\nMost languages can do B+ Trees because everything is garbage collected and therefore it's \"fine\" to have several copies of the same value because they're all just pointers to the same value at some location in the heap.\n\nTo get a workable solution in Rust you will have to choose one of the following tradeoffs, I believe:\n- Require that keys are Clone (or even Copy -- Copy should prevent internal mutability iirc)\n- Store all keys Rc's to get proper shared ownership.\n- Store all keys in Boxes and have unsafe raw pointers to the boxes in the internal nodes\n- Store all keys in the leaves and have unsafe raw pointers to the leaves in the internal nodes\n",

    "body": "`Rc` is just like `Box` in that it heap allocates, and can contain unsized data like `[T]`. So `Rc<Box<X>>` can usually be reduced to `Rc<X>`. The only overhead of Rc over Box is that every time you Drop or Clone them they frob an internal reference count (also they consume more memory for that reference count).\n\nI don't think you can use safe references for a BTree though. Lifetimes (`'a`) are scopes( `{ .. }`) in the program somewhere. The internal data of a collection does not exist for any particular scope; rather they exist as long as the collection does. You will likely need to use raw pointers (`*const T`). Note that unlike references these _are_ nullable, so the Option is not needed (and will impose overhead if used, because the None case cannot be optimized to a null pointer).\n",

This might be a reasonable performance wise but it won't make to the stdlib. \n",
