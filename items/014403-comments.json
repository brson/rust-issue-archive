    "body": "<del>This</del> The build failure is mingw-3.x-specific issue since we migrated to mingw-w64.\n\nFrom `rt/rust_builtin.c`:\n\n``` c\nstruct tm* GMTIME(const time_t *clock, struct tm *result) {\n    struct tm* t = gmtime(clock);\n    if (t == NULL || result == NULL) { return NULL; }\n    *result = *t;\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nOn mingw-w64, the definition of `gmtime` is:\n\n``` c\n#if !defined(_USE_32BIT_TIME_T)\n__CRT_INLINE struct tm *__cdecl gmtime(const time_t *_Time) { return _gmtime64(_Time); }\n#else\n__CRT_INLINE struct tm *__cdecl gmtime(const time_t *_Time) { return _gmtime32(_Time); }\n#endif\n```\n\nand [`_USE_32BIT_TIME_T`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4wacf567.aspx) is defined on mingw-w64. So our `rustc.exe` expects that you have `_gmtime_32`.\n\nHowever old mingw 3.20 (gcc 4.6.2) does not have `_gmtime32`:\n\n```\n$ nm /mingw/lib/libmsvcrt.a  | grep gmtime\n00000000 I __imp__gmtime\n00000000 T _gmtime\n00000000 T __gmtime64\n00000000 I __imp___gmtime64\n```\n\ntherefore it causes linker issues.\n\n(Actually I think the `rust_gmtime` wrapper should be removed)\n",

It can be an evidence that you're experiencing dll incompatibility between mingw-w64 and mingw.\nAlso I failed to reproduce the error on mingw 4.0 (gcc 4.8). That is, I succeeded to build and run hello-world example.\n\nIn any case, could you provide gdb backtrace? (`backtrace` command will work, and building hello with `rust --debuginfo=2` may be better)\nAlso, could you check `PATH` variable by `echo $PATH`?\n",
