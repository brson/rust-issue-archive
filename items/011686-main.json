  "body": "Renamed the `invert()` function in `iter.rs` to `flip()`, from #10632 \n\nAlso renamed the `Invert<T>` type to `Flip<T>`.\n\nSome related code comments changed. Documentation that I could find has\nbeen updated, and all the instances I could locate where the\nfunction/type were called have been updated as well.\n\nThis is my first contribution to Rust! Apologies in advance if I've snarfed the \nPR process, I'm not used to rebase.\n\nI initially had issues with the `codegen` section of the tests failing, however\nthe `make check` process is not reporting any failures at this time. I think\nthat was a local env issue more than me facerolling my changes. :)\n",
