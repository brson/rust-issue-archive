If the point is that using `m` as a _type_ should yield the _type_ `m::t`, then I think `export t as type` makes the most sense. It seems logical to me that to use the `type` keyword when exporting a _type_ as the \"exported type\" of a module.   \n",

When the module is imported and referred to in a type context, then this referral is interpreted as being the _master type_ of that module.\n\nThe _master type_ thing could bereplaced by _self type_ _module type_ _eigentype_ ,etc, whatever good term you can think of.

However, now add an option on the exporter side to \"bubble up\" a type one namespace level, effectively putting that type's name at the same namespace level as the containing module.\n\nE.g.\n\n```\nmod foo\n{\n          export sometype promoted; // not serious about the 'promoted' keyword, drawing a blank\n          enum sometype { /*...*/ };\n}\n```\n\nIf another module then just imports foo, you can use foo as a module to refer to other items within it, but sometype is also available _unqualified_ because of the special \"promote\" modifier which puts it at the same level as foo. \n\nThat lets you define a type \"option\" inside the module \"option\", but without the special case that you can only have one \"self type\". Any data type can be lifted up to be \"equal\" to its containing module, w.r.t. the namespace hierarchy.\n",

It looks to me like the problem with the `option::t` convention is that you can't use it with `import` correctly. \nMaybe we could simply adopt the convention that the name of the \"master type\" of a module (as I called it before) should be the same as that of the module, and that the user has to use `import modulename::modulename` to use that type. For a programming language, sometimes sensible conventions are better than complex features.\n",
