  "body": "When building Rust libraries (e.g. librustc, libstd, etc), checks for\nand verbosely removes previous build products before invoking rustc.\n(Also, when Make variable VERBOSE is defined, it will list all of the\nlibraries matching the object library's glob after the rustc\ninvocation has completed.)\n\nWhen installing Rust libraries, checks for previous libraries in\ntarget install directory, but does not remove them.\n\nThe thinking behind these two different modes of operation is that the\ninstallation target, unlike the build tree, is not under the control\nof this infrastructure and it is not up to this Makefile to decide if\nthe previous libraries should be removed.\n\nFixes #3225 (at least in terms of mitigating the multiple library\nproblem by proactively warning the user about it.)\n",
