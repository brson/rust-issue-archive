    "body": "@alexcrichton: @aturon can probably give a better rationale, but here's a few points off the top of my head: \n- this logically decouples the actual implementation from the API. That is, there's no fundamental reason why TreeMap and TreeSet need be the same implementation/module.\n- If iterator names get refactored to just be like Iter, IterMut, IntoIter, then there will be a naming conflict between the maps/sets if they share a namespace. This design avoids that issue.\n- You can import exactly everything relevant to a particular collection with a single glob: `use std::collections::treeset::*`.\n",

    "body": "One observation: in general the module names should be snake cased versions of the type names. That is, whenever you have an embedded capital leader in the type name, it should map to an underscore in the module name. Examples: `d_list`, `tree_map`, `small_int_map`.\n\nI realize that some of these are a bit odd/painful, but naming consistency is important. In a lot of these cases, you'll know the type name by heart, and being able to translate directly to the module name is helpful.\n\n(We could potentially consider a different convention, but snake case is a long-standing one and we'd need to actually spell out the rules, go through an RFC, etc.)\n",

Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.\n\nWhich I agree with.

    "body": "@Gankro But that's Python's guidelines, not ours! We have a strong convention toward snake case for \"value-level\" items like modules and functions. Clearly the proposal here isn't to throw that out in general, or even just for modules. But how would you decide when to use which convention? The conventions lose much of their benefit if there's no consistent way to follow them. (Things like \"if it improves readability\" immediately mean I can no longer mechanically come up with the right name; it's a subjective choice.)\n\n(Not trying to put this all on you, just thinking out loud about the issue.)\n\nWhat would you think about having the type names `Btree`, `Dlist` and so on? Part of the concern here is consistency in chunking into \"words\" at both the type and module level.\n",

We're trying to set up official conventions to help nail down these issues. The [basic naming conventions](http://aturon.github.io/style/naming/README.html) are basically just de facto standards based on long-running practice, but as we're seeing they're not 100% followed. Maybe this suggests that even these basic conventions need to go through a round of RFC, to resolve the kind of issue you're raising.\n\nIn any case, we certainly don't need to hold up the PR for this, since these problems already existed in the collections.

    "body": "@alexcrichton I think @Gankro laid out several of the important benefits of this design, but here are a few others:\n- It institutes a general convention for collections (which is followed in a lot of other places to): modules defining an important type are named after that type, and contain definitions only relevant to it.\n- In increases overall consistency and therefore makes things _more_ mechanical: if I want stuff relevant to `HashMap`, I import `hashmap`, end of story. (Note that this would work even better if the word splitting matched, i.e. `hash_map`, as I'm arguing above.)\n\nBasically, I think the fact that hash maps and sets lived in the same module is something you had to _learn_, even if it now seems convenient, and it only applies in certain cases (where there's both a set and a map implemented in the same way). Consistently splitting up the modules means there's less to learn/remember, and I think it actually improves ergonomics (as @Gankro mentioned, making globs more useful).\n",

Most modules are a single word, so it's hard to get a lot of data.\n\nModule names strike me as a place where writeability is much more important than readability, as they're going to be sprinkled around a lot as namespaces, but their actual meaning is unimportant to the reader.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of Btree of Dlist, as they're supposed to be shortenings of the proper names B-Tree and DoublyLinkedList. Although I've typo'd those enough times out of uncertainty to not have a strong resolve.\n\nAs a not-very-good data point, settling on this convention has less breakage for the collections, as alllowercase is the overwhelming convention there.\n",

    "body": "@Gankro There are a couple of problems with just going for alwayslowercase. For one, as even its name suggests, it is often not very readable -- hence the PEP recommendation to sprinkle underscores when it \"helps readability\".\n\nAnother downside is it means proliferation of more, different naming styles. Why is snake case OK when typing function and method names (which are more commonly multiword) but not modules?\n\nYou're right that it's hard to get good data here, since most modules are single words. But snake case is definitely followed to some degree throughout (e.g. `from_str`, `lru_cache`, etc.) I think `stdio` is being understood as a single \"word\" or something -- at any rate there's no type like `StdIo`.\n\nWhat about a convention that with snake case you never do `foo_x_bar` where `x` is a single character -- `x_` would always just become `x`? That seems like it would deal with the worst offenders (like `d_list`) but leave us with the pretty reasonable `tree_map`.\n",
