    "body": "[Ada has this](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming/Types/range). It would be great in Rust, as we're going for the same niche of low-level + high-assurance.\n\nI wonder though if we should go for a more general system, such as refinement types or pre/post-conditions.  There have been a number of successes bolting these onto languages like [Haskell](http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/liquid/haskell/blog/about/), [F#](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/f7/), and [C#](http://rise4fun.com/specsharp/).  AIUI, they manage this without heavy changes to the core language.  The condition checker is a mostly-separate tool that gathers proof obligations from the source code and passes them to a SMT solver.\n\nBasically I think this is an area where we should give researchers and other interested parties some time to experiment before we standardize something into Rust itself.\n",
