    "body": "That's a good point. Exponent and number of decimal digits used to be a smaller integer type and I didn't stop to reconsider when I switched to 64 bit integers. However, exploiting this insight requires restructuring some code: The exponent is parsed in the parsing module, which isn't expected to produce any floats. I'll sleep over the least hacky way to integrate this.\n\nA related aspect is that the integral and fractional parts really can't be larger than 1.8 exabyte, which is the limit now. I'll remove those guards when I do the other change.\n",

(The Clinger paper calls out a similar scenario in section 9.)\n\nNot silly at all! Unfortunately the VM on which I'd normally test this currently has... issues. If anyone could compile a short program doing a float multiplication with a 32 bit rust and `-C target-feature=\"-sse\"` and post the assembly, that'd be great. x87 _can_ round correctly by setting the control word correctly, but GCC for example never does this. I'd have to check if LLVM allows doing so and if rustc instructs it to.\n",

Turns out the exact same problem described in the paper (in the context of a Motorola 68881/68882 floating point coprocessor) also applies to more common hardware. `1.448997445238699` is rounded incorrectly, to the float whose shortest decimal representation is `1.4489974452386991` (off by one ULP). Bummer. I'll do _something_ about this before merging, but I don't know yet _what_.\n",
