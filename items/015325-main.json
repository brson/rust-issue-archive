  "body": "with the corresponding trait parameter bounds.\n\nThis is a version of the patch in PR #12611 by Florian Hahn, modified to\naddress Niko's feedback.\n\nIt does not address the issue of duplicate type parameter bounds, nor\ndoes it address the issue of implementation-defined methods that contain\n_fewer_ bounds than the trait, because Niko's review indicates that this\nshould not be necessary (and indeed I believe it is not). A test has\nbeen added to ensure that this works.\n\nThis will break code like:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar<T:Baz>();\n}\n\nimpl Foo for Boo {\n    fn bar<T:Baz + Quux>() { ... }\n    //             ^~~~ ERROR\n}\n```\n\nThis will be rejected because the implementation requires _more_ bounds\nthan the trait. It can be fixed by either adding the missing bound to\nthe trait:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar<T:Baz + Quux>();\n    //             ^~~~\n}\n\nimpl Foo for Boo {\n    fn bar<T:Baz + Quux>() { ... }  // OK\n}\n```\n\nOr by removing the bound from the impl:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar<T:Baz>();\n}\n\nimpl Foo for Boo {\n    fn bar<T:Baz>() { ... }  // OK\n    //       ^ remove Quux\n}\n```\n\nThis patch imports the relevant tests from #2687, as well as the test\ncase in #5886, which is fixed as well by this patch.\n\nCloses #2687.\nCloses #5886.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nr? @pnkfelix\n",
