This should only trigger when the value being matched has a finite set of possible constructors. In fact, in the test cases that are of this PR, there is nothing the user could really do other than disabling the lint.\n\nEven more so, I think this lint would be very useful for \"open\" enums like our AST node types but could get pretty annoying for \"sealed\" enums like Option where it's just more ergonomic to match on Some and have a catch-all pattern for None:\n\n``` rust\nmatch Some(42u) { Some(x) => (), _ => () }\n```\n\nIn which case maybe it should really work on an opt-in basis for each type. But then I fear it also falls out of scope of the compiler to come with that kind of lints...\n",

    "body": "@schmee I think this will definitely do for now but at the same time having the lint only trigger on ty_enum at the top level seems fairly arbitrary. What I find very common are match expressions on ty_rptr(ty_enum) (`match x { &Some(_) => (), _ => () }`) etc. But I think this is okay for now. Thank you!\n\nWhat I think would be desired in the future is have this lint be produced by check_match.rs for all types, whenever there is a wildcard pattern in any column that captures _more_ than one constructor. Tying it with check_match.rs would be somewhat unfortunate but very convenient as the message could be more specific about the constructors being captured. On top of that, then the lint could be enabled by default because it'd only produce warnings when those catch-all patterns are actually dangerous (i.e. when they capture more than one variant of an enum).\n",

    "body": "@schmee There's also ty_box. And tuples. Nested enums. That's why I think we should perhaps go ahead and make this lint be part of the sanity checker in check_match.rs based on the general rules outlined in my previous comment.\n\nMy personal opinion on lints in general is that now that Rust has pluggable lints, the threshold for built-in should be much higher. In particular, I do not think lints disabled by default are particularly suited to be part of the compiler. In addition, if they're too specific that they hardly trigger at all when they should, or too general that they're too noisy, that's also bad. But this is my personal opinion and the Rust team may feel differently.\n\nIn this case, though, I think we could get away with making this way more general. And to battle test it, I recall @nikomatsakis has a strong preference for avoiding _ patterns in the borrow checker so maybe this should support something along the lines of `#[must_use]` of the unused result lint. An annotation you could put on a specific enum to turn the lint on for it.\n\nI'm happy to help out with integrating this with check_match.rs. It would be nice to increase the bus factor of that part of the compiler!\n",
