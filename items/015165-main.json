  "body": "Yes, it is important to be careful, but repeated emphasis about it is probably\nnot helpful \u2014 it starts to sound like you came for a tutorial but found a\nfinger-wagging lecture.\n\nEven after I removed a few of these comments, there are still several left in\nthe text. That's probably fine! A couple of mentions of how this is dangerous\nand you ought to be careful may be a good reminder to the reader.\n\nAfter making the edits, I reflowed the paragraphs that I had touched, using\nemacs's \"M-x fill-paragraph\", with fill-column equal to 70.\n",
