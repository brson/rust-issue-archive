    "body": "Edit: This was a thought from Python's evolution of print from version 2 to 3; unlike Python, in Rust, `println!` is almost never used for file output; programs instead use `write!/ln!` for that. That means: it is not as important to handle errors with `println!`.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI want to think about what a typical Rust program's evolution is going to be. A mature program is going to want to handle this error case gracefully, does that mean that at some point of the development of a typical rust program it's going to have to replace all its `println!()` calls with more complicated `writeln!` invocations? (Probably using an internal macro to keep sanity.)\r\n\r\nI think that if `println!()` ends up being this obsolete feature of a maturing Rust program, eventually becoming useless, then the design is wrong.\r\n",
