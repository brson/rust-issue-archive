    "body": "Note that the reason for a build-in `as` is mainly casts in constexprs. Also, it's used for casting to a Trait object. Replacing `as` with methods, or turning `as` into sugar for them is a nice idea, but there needs to be solution for sth like this:\n\n```\nstatic FOO: char = 159u8 as char;\nstatic BAR: u8 = '?' as u8 + 45;\n```\n\nHowever, seeing how\n1. Explicit casting to Traitobjects might get removed and replaced with implicit coercion,\n2. `as` is only used for arithmetic casts otherwise,\n3. Trait-based casts are more versatile and user-extensible.\n\nIt might be sensible to replace the constexpr-use case with a `static_cast!()` syntax extension:\n\n```\nstatic FOO: char = static_cast!(159u8 as char);\nstatic BAR: u8 = static_cast!('?' as u8) + 45;\n```\n\nwhich would be hard-coded to expand to a literal of the right type.\nIn fact, such a extension would nicely subsume the current `bytes!()`-se.\n",

    "body": "Note that I've been thinking about CTFE and how it can be used with static items. I think @bblum's effect proposal could easily express this: only functions/methods _without_ certain effects are valid for consideration for CTFE. This would fit in nicely with `#[static_assert]` (for example, I want to assert that two `&'static[&'static str]` are the same size , but currently cannot because `.len()` (a method call) is not currently allowable). Combine that with an `as` trait and perhaps it could be allow in a static context? Although I'm not sure how well that'd work out in practice: sometimes you _want_ the conversion to have effects, or need effects to actually do the cast. So maybe `static_cast!()` isn't a bad idea (or just special-casing the numeric casts).\n\nI didn't consider how this would interact with trait objects and I don't know enough about them to evaluate its effect on them.\n",

    "body": "@Kimundi: curse you, constant expressions! Bane of my existence. We could tone this down, and provide these traits to standardize how we transform from one type to another, and keep `as` around for the constant expressions.\n\nAnother option is to copy the `bytes!` syntax extension, and implement enough compile-time-typecasts to cover cases like you mentioned:\n\n```\nstatic FOO: char = char!(159u8);\nstatic BAR: u8 = u8!('?') + 45;\n```\n\nEither way, it's not _that_ common to use these static casts, at least in rust proper.

Might be an issue with asserts -- if you wanted to write asserts in your function but have it be constexpr anyway, either you would have to pick one, or the compiler would be smart enough to turn the assert into a compile fail (which seems both possible and pretty leet, but difficult). The latter strikes me as a far-future feature.\n\nAlso keep in mind effects won't be in 1.0, so it would have to be backwards-compatible.\n",
