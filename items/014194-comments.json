    "body": "The only way I can think of adding this without extending the API would be to say that paths beginning with a '@' are in the abstract namespace (think: @ for abstract). That way you could call\n\n```\nconnect(\"@/this/is/an/abstract/path\");\n```\n\nIt's an ugly hack though and in my opinion an extension to the API would be much preferable.\n\nIf I understand your suggestion correctly it is to change the type of UnixStream::connect to\n\n```\nconnect<P: ToUnixAddress>(path: P) -> IOResult<UnixStream>\n```\n\nThat would require adding an impl ToUnixAddress to everything that currently implements ToCStr (Path, &str and &[u8]), as well as defining a new type called AbstractPath or something. This way you could call\n\n```\nUnixStream::connect(AbstractPath::new(\"/this/is/an/abstract/path\"));\n```\n\nIs this what you had in mind?\n\nPersonally I think the cleanest way of doing this would be to add connect_abstract et al. and clearly document that these functions are **Linux only**. It's okay to add platform-specific functions if those functions only make sense on one platform. I'm a Linux developer and if I'm reading through an API's documentation and I see a function marked **Windows only** I just ignore it and keep scrolling.\n\nI think it's important to support these one way or an other as they're used on Linux extensively. I've only just started playing around with Rust and the first two things I've gone to write are a DBus library and a GNUnet library. Both of these require abstract sockets for library<->daemon communication.\n",
