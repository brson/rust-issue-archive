    "body": "This is a close relative of #488. The problem is that builtin_equal doesn't have tydescs bound to it. Doing `bind builtin_equal(_, _)` will fix it.\n\nThe two obvious options I can think of for fixing the bug are: \n1) have the typechecker disallow this program (that is, you can't pass generic functions without explicitly binding them).\n2) implicitly specialize when passing a generic function \n\nSolution 1 is pretty lame. Solution 2 imposes a somewhat hidden performance cost, which we may want to avoid? I prefer solution 2, but would be interested in ways to make it cheaper.\n",
