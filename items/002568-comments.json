    "body": "This is sort of related to #2498 - I want to add javadoc comments (to the parser probably as a special type of attribute), but attributes can either be 'outer' or 'inner' types so that needs to be indicated by the javadocs as well.\n\nAdding significant semicolons after comments is bizarre so I was going to use doxygen's `/**< ... */` comments to indicate that a comment is associated with what came before, not what comes after. I was also thinking to change attribute syntax to match. This doesn't fix your problem at all that having two different syntaxes is just confusing, but at least something with the differentiating character in front (`#<`) would be more visible than the trailing semi.\n",
