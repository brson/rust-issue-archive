The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis ok, sounds good.\n\nI looked through the relevant code in more detail and I am confident that this is correct.\n\nThe `resolve_lifetimes` code assumes that there is a binder around the field `lifetimes: HirVec<LifetimeDef>` of `hir::Generics` when the generics are for a function or a method (like all binders at the hir level, this is implicit).\n\nWhen converting these `hir::Generics` into `ty::Generics` and `ty::GenericsPredicates` ([here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_typeck/collect.rs#L1858-L1869) and [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_typeck/collect.rs#L1776-L1790), respectively), we only consider the early bound regions, so the hir level binder has no effect. The late bound regions are converted [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_typeck/astconv.rs#L1768) only (along with the rest of the function signature), and they do end up [behind an explicit binder](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_typeck/astconv.rs#L1822).\n",
