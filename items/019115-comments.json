So at the end as a user you would see the lint warning _and_ an exhaustiveness error, and most likely only pay attention to the latter, which is guaranteed to be rather obscure.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I see! Thanks for the feedback. I made it so that warnings will not be printed out if the command-line level lint level for the `warnings` group is `allow`. This isn't perfect in that ideally it should respect crate-level and item-level lint levels as well but it should address Cargo's use case. FWIW, there already are warnings in rustc that would not have respected the flag before this change.\n",
