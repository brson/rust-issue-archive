    "body": "I think the user part should say just \"`username` in the above example\" rather than using the Rust struct syntax. Also choose one for \"hash or pound sign\" (you could even write \"doesn't include the leading `#`\"), at the moment it could be interpreted as \"doesn't include the leading hash, and also doesn't include the leading pound sign\" which is nonsensical but may be confusing to a nonnative speaker.\n",
