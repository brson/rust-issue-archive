    "body": "Regarding naming: `utf16_units` is not a good name. As far as I can tell, the choice of \"code unit\" in the Unicode Standard is mostly \u201cwhat\u2019s another word for \"thing\" that we haven\u2019t used yet?\u201d I suggest renaming `str::utf16_units` to `str::encode_utf16` (and its return type accordingly, if it stays around at all).\n\nRegarding the API: `&str -> Iterator<Item=u16>` in the middle of the balance between terseness and generality:\n- If what you want is a `Vec<u16>`, having the method return an iterator makes you write \"redundant\" `.collect()` (or even `.collect::<Vec<_>>()`).\n- If what you have is an iterator of `char`, collecting it into a `String` is wasteful as the only thing the method does with `&str` is get a `str::Chars` iterator out of it.\n\nI suggest changing `str::encode_utf16` to go all the way to the \"convenience\" side and make it return a `Vec<u16>`. (This is symmetrical with `String::from_utf16*` where neither input or output is an iterator.) `char::encode_utf16` (#27784) can be used directly to avoid extra allocations in cases where a different type of input or output is desired.\n",
