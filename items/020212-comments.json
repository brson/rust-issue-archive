The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pcwalton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@steveklabnik You have noticed that I've changed the language around \"variable bindings\". My beef with this phrasing is that it's idiosyncratic, rather peculiar, and perhaps incorrect.\n\nMy understanding of variable bindings is that they are a _relationship_ established by certain language constructs, not the things we see and talk about in our source code. Therefore, talking about `x` in `let x = 5i;` as a \"variable binding\" is actually incorrect. `x` is a variable, and the `let` construct establishes a binding for that variable.\n\nWhat's the original reasoning behind using the phrase \"variable binding\" instead of \"variable\"? If its already a settled matter, then its usage needs to be consistent throughout the Guide. And perhaps a stronger case needs to be made when introducing this peculiarity as to why newcomers should care.\n",
