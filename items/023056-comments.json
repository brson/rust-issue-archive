The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nrc (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

I do worry that this is a bit of a footgun every time someone does a snapshot (it means they're less automatic to do). I also like having a uniform process rather than exceptions, even if those exceptions make things easier.\n\nStill it is simple to rewind, and look likes a win overall, so @bors: r+ 1e68dfd\n",
