    "body": "I'd like to take the conn on this, and echo this thought:\n\n> Note that this is a large enough feature that this may want to be prototyped outside the standard library first and then perhaps consider moving in at a later date.\n\nI've taken a brief survey other other implementations which range from every-feature-in-the-book (`ftw` in glibc) to very minimal (Go's `filepath.Walk`), so there's a lot of variation on what we can do. I'd like to start with the following goals:\n- Fix the \"too many open fds\" issue. I am particularly fond of making the common case fast and falling back to some kind of memory allocation if we exceed some preset (but configurable) limit on the number of open file descriptors. (I think this probably means switching to depth first search, since it \"feels\" like shallow but bigger directories are more common than very deeply nested directories. In particular, with depth first search, we can guarantee that at most one file descriptor is open for each depth.)\n- Provide some kind of facility for traversing symlinks (but this should be configurable and will require extra resources if we want to preserve the invariant that every item is yielded exactly once).\n- Provide control over iteration (e.g., \"don't descend into this directory\" or \"skip the rest of this directory.\")\n\nMost of the interfaces I've seen use a user-provided function to control iteration or even response to errors. I feel like we should probably pursue the same functionality but with iterators if possible, although I'm not sure what it will look like yet. Possibly methods on the iterator itself? (Although this is a design that is not too common in the Rust world.)\n\nHow does this sound for a reasonable starting point?\n",
