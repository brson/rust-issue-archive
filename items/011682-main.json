  "body": "This is just an initial implementation and does not yet fully replace `~[T]`. A generic initialization syntax for containers is missing, and the slice functionality needs to be reworked to make auto-slicing unnecessary.\n\nTraits for supporting indexing properly are also required. This also needs to be fixed to make ring buffers as easy to use as vectors.\n\nThe tests and documentation for `~[T]` can be ported over to this type when it is removed. I don't really expect DST to happen for vectors as having both `~[T]` and `Vec<T>` is overcomplicated and changing the slice representation to 3 words is not at all appealing. Unlike with traits, it's possible (and easy) to implement `RcSlice<T>` and `GcSlice<T>` without compiler help.\n",
