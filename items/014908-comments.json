They should be free functions.\n\nThe current state of my PR #15399 actually provides the same functionality under different names, along with a 3rd function to unwrap a uniquely-owned `Rc<T>`. You can see this at kballard/rust@5033b2445. I was thinking of removing this because I believe my pending rewrite of the PR doesn't need that functionality any more, but the existence of this PR here suggests that it is more generally useful.\n\nIf you have no objection, I'm inclined to re-submit just that one commit as a PR (that would obsolete this PR).\n",
