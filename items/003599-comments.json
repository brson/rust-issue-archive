    "body": "I should have responded to this before. Preemptive apology: this interface is not so good.\n\nThe problem here may be in accepting and handling the connection in the on_connect callback. That callback runs directly on the I/O loop, so doing long running operations in that callback will block all I/O entirely. The way it's intended to be used is to delegate the accepting and handling of the connection to another task, but there are some wrinkles.\n\nYou can't just call `spawn` from the on_connect callback because of #3760. The on_connect callback runs on the iotask's scheduler, and spawning another task there will cause one or both of them to block just the same as if you didn't spawn at all.\n\nAdditionally, a connection has to be 'accepted' before the on_connect callback returns, _but_ calling `accept` returns a TcpSomething that is _non-sendable_, so you can't call 'accept' in the callback.\n\nWhat you have to do is set up another task to handle the acceptance of connections.\n\nHere's an example of a working TCP server and client, more readable than the TCP test cases: https://github.com/brson/rust/commit/fcfdd49795dca81ffbdf707a307033517a270cb1#L0R789\n",

The Receiver task is needed because if that code is in the on_connect callback it blocks.\nhttps://gist.github.com/machee/5943794\n\nI share @mneumann's [concern](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/4296#issuecomment-11715265) that the idea behind libuv is to use an event loop and not threads. Two tasks/threads might be acceptable, but the only way I could get an [echo server to work with multiple connections](https://gist.github.com/machee/5943869) was spawning a task for each connection.\n\nSeems to me that `read`/`read_start` should not block, but should take a callback. It's not clear if this is the intended design or if it's just that more work is needed.\n",
