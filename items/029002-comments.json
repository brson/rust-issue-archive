    "body": "Basically, the compiler has two different ways of reasoning about this sort of construct.\n\nIf there's exactly one implementation of Extractor, the compiler reasons forward. it picks that implementation, and concludes that `s` is of type `&String` based on that.  Therefore, the call to `expected(s)` desugars to `expected(&**s)`.\n\nIf there are multiple implementations, it reasons backwards: it sees that `expected(s)` takes an `&str`, therefore the type of `s` must be `&str`, and therefore `extract()` must return an `Option<str>`.\n\nThe interaction is a little unfortunate, but I don't think there's any practical way to change inference to make your second testcase work.\n",
