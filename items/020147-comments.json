    "body": "`InvariantLifetime` doesn't have this example (atm), and, the example only makes sense with `InvariantType` since there's no lifetimes involved in the definition of the `Cell` type. I do think the example could probably have a little more description, but I don't think it's wrong.\n\nFor reference, it currently says:\n\n`````` rust\n/// The Cell type is an example which uses unsafe code to achieve\n/// \"interior\" mutability:\n///\n/// ```\n/// struct Cell<T> { value: T }\n/// ```\n///\n/// The type system would infer that `value` is only read here and\n/// never written, but in fact `Cell` uses unsafe code to achieve\n/// interior mutability.\n``````\n",
