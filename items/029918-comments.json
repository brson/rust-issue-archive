    "body": "The question is if we want to drop the invariant that CString is guarding (no interior nulls). [thestinger claims](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/7235#issuecomment-19703150) this causes security bugs. It's certainly in the category of problem prevention rather than direct memory safety.\n",

    "body": "The libs team discussed this during triage yesterday and the conclusion was that it is a static contract of the `CString` type that there are no interior nul bytes. It is considered suitable for types which provide these sorts of static contracts to use `unsafe` for methods that may violate this, so this fits within the conventions of the standard library.\n",
