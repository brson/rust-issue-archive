  "body": "The first commit improves code generation through a few changes:\n- The `#[inline]` attributes allow llvm to constant fold the encoding step away in certain situations. For example, code like this changes from a call to `encode_utf8` in a inner loop to the pushing of a byte constant:\n  \n  ``` rust\n  let mut s = String::new();\n  for _ in range(0u, 21) {\n      s.push_char('a');\n  }\n  ```\n- Both methods changed their semantic from causing run time failure if the target buffer is not large enough to returning `None` instead. This makes llvm no longer emit code for causing failure for these methods.\n- A few debug `assert!()` calls got removed because they affected code generation due to unwinding, and where basically unnecessary with today's sound handling of `char` as a Unicode scalar value.\n\n~~The second commit is optional. It changes the methods from regular indexing with the `dst[i]` syntax to unsafe indexing with `dst.unsafe_mut_ref(i)`. This does not change code generation directly - in both cases llvm is smart enough to see that there can never be an out-of-bounds access. But it makes it emit a `nounwind` attribute for the function. \nHowever, I'm not sure whether that is a real improvement, so if there is any objection to this I'll remove the commit.~~\n\nThis changes how the methods behave on a too small buffer, so this is a \n\n[breaking-change]\n",
