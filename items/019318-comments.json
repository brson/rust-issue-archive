    "body": "Sorry for the delayed report. I tracked this down before thanksgiving but forgot to take notes. The problem is that we are hitting the maximum recursion depth counter for the builtin bounds. The simplest fix then is to up this depth -- the whole idea was that the depth would be configurable per crate. However, I'm not sure that it actually _is_. \n\nI guess I would say there are three problems here:\n1. A clearer error report! Overflow is supposed to be clearly detected and \"bubble up\", but that got lost and it's now being kind of silently lumped into \"failed to resolve\". Bad.\n2. Configurable limits. This should be pretty easy to implement if it doesn't exist already. \n3. Recursion for builtin bounds doesn't technically need to increment the recursion counter in many cases; I considered this when implementing, but wasn't sure whether I wanted to take advantage of it, since it would make builtin bounds vary more than other types.\n",
