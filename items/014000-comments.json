    "body": "@alexcrichton so it seems like the `rustdoc` problem is (once again) something where the compiler chooses one library it finds for `libnative` and it does not match the choice made by the dynamic searching when we run the executable itself.\n\nOf particular interest: it seems like the override of the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is causing the problem.  If we omit that, then things _seem_ to work, though I am not yet sure exactly why.\n\nHere is an example of what I am seeing:\nhttps://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/9c2c186b420645b852b3\n\nProblems like this were what led me to just disable rustdoc entirely for stage1 rather than attempt to decipher where I needed to adjust the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the `make -> run rustdoc -> run compiled code block` chain...\n",

Instead we will put in the more robust solution also discussed in the irc log, where the child process will set up its own `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` instead of having the parent muck with its own value for that env var before spawning the child process.\n",
