    "body": "@steveklabnik the additions seem fine (i.e. r=me); the suggestions noted by @Manishearth also seem like good changes.\n\nIts funny (or perhaps sad); my original issue #24656 was that I could not find documentation for the actual meaning of `.*`.\n- Yet such documentation can clearly be seen here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcollections/fmt.rs#L106\n- I have no explanation for how I overlooked that text in my repeated scans of the docs.  Maybe I was looking at the code directly in a checkout that predated your addition from PR #23493 ; anyway, sorry if my original issue text seemed shrill.\n- Update: Maybe part of the reason for my confusion is that the text at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcollections/fmt.rs#L106 is presented as if it were an aside about requiring particular types for certain format parameters, but _not_ about a breakdown of what each of the format parameters means.  (and indeed, that makes sense, since line 106 is _too early_ for an explanation of all the variants of the `precision` argument)\n",

    "body": "Although, reading over that text from  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcollections/fmt.rs#L106 now, it seems like there is a _little_ room for improvement.\n\nNamely: While that text does describe the meaning of `{:.*}`, it does _not_ describe the meaning of `{:.<num>}`.\n\n~~I.e. I might have guessed that `{:.5}` means that it should print five decimal places, but it actually means lookup the number of decimal places to print from the argument number five (right? That's what I at least infer from my reverse engineering in those examples I wrote.)~~\n\nUpdate: I goofed, so I have crossed out some erroneous text from the above.  Namely, the examples used `{:.5$}`, not `{:.5}`; the `$` is what makes it interpret the `5` as \"argument number five.\"\n",

    "body": "So here is a draft of what we might write in the new `precision` section:\n\n> ## Precision\n> \n> ...\n> For floating-point types, this indicates how many digits after the decimal point should be printed.\n> \n> There are three possible ways to specify the desired `precision`: (1.) an integer `.N`, (2.) an integer followed by dollar sign `.N$`, or (3.) an asterisk `.*`.\n> - The first specification, `.N`, means the integer `N` itself is the precision.\n> - The second, `.N$`, means use format _argument_ `N` (which must be a `usize`) as the precision.\n> - Finally,  `.*` means that this `{...}` is associated with _two_ format inputs rather than one: the first input holds the `usize` precision, and the second holds the value to print.  Note that in this case, if one uses the format string `{<arg>:<spec>.*}`, then the `<arg>` part refers to the _value_ to print, and the `precision` must come in the input preceding `<arg>`.\n> \n> For example, these: \n> \n> ```\n> // Hello {arg 0 (x)} is {arg 1 (0.01} with precision specified inline (5)}\n> println!(\"Hello {0} is {1:.5}\", \"x\", 0.01);\n> \n> // Hello {arg 1 (x)} is {arg 2 (0.01} with precision specified in arg 0 (5)}\n> println!(\"Hello {1} is {2:.0$}\", 5, \"x\", 0.01);\n> \n> // Hello {arg 0 (x)} is {arg 2 (0.01} with precision specified in arg 1 (5)}\n> println!(\"Hello {0} is {2:.1$}\", \"x\", 5, 0.01);\n> \n> // Hello {next arg (x)} is {second of next two args (0.01} with precision\n> //                          specified in first of next two args (5)}\n> println!(\"Hello {} is {:.*}\",    \"x\", 5, 0.01);\n> \n> // Hello {next arg (x)} is {arg 2 (0.01} with precision\n> //                          specified in its predecessor (5)}\n> println!(\"Hello {} is {2:.*}\",   \"x\", 5, 0.01);\n> ```\n> \n> All print the same thing:\n> \n> ``` text\n> Hello x is 0.01000\n> ```\n> \n> While these:\n> \n> ```\n> println!(\"{}, `{name:.*}` has 3 fractional digits\", \"Hello\", 3, name=1234.56);\n> println!(\"{}, `{name:.*}` has 3 characters\", \"Hello\", 3, name=\"1234.56\");\n> ```\n> \n> print two significantly different things:\n> \n> ``` text\n> Hello, `1234.560` has 3 fractional digits\n> Hello, `123` has 3 characters\n> ```\n\nUpdate: added a fifth example to the first series of Hello's to illustrate the `.N` format.\n",
