    "body": "Yes I saw the wget think and I forgot the fix.\n\n## \n\nMahmut Bulut\n11 Kas 2012 18:29 tarihinde \"catseye\" notifications@github.com yazd\u00fd:\n\n> This change fixes a few things in the tutorial. Aside from the obvious\n> minor grammatical edits:\n> - It seems odd to list curl as a dependency and then recommend using\n>   wget to grab the tarball. Changed the command to curl -O.\n> - The list of basic arithmetic operations was a mix of parts of\n>   speech; they are now all imperative verbs.\n> - The tutorial has a section about the preferred terminology for the\n>   kinds of pointers, but subsequently occasionally uses the non-preferred\n>   terms \"shared box\" and \"unique box\"; these have been changed to \"managed\n>   box\" and \"owned box\".\n> \n> ---\n> \n> You can merge this Pull Request by running:\n> \n>   git pull https://github.com/catseye/rust tutorial-grammar-fixes\n> \n> Or view, comment on, or merge it at:\n> \n>   https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/3947\n> Commit Summary\n> - Minor grammatical edits; use preferred nomenclature consistently.\n> \n> File Changes\n> - _M_ doc/tutorial.md (34)\n> \n> Patch Links\n> - https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/3947.patch\n> - https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/3947.diff\n>   \n>   ## \n>   \n>   Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/3947.\n",
