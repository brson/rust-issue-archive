  "body": "Fix an assertion in grow when using add_front.\n\nSpeeds up grow (and the functions that use it) by a lot. We retain the vector instead of creating it anew for each grow. \n\nThe struct field hi is removed since it is redundant, and all iterators are updated to use a representation closer to the Deque itself, it should make it work even if deque sizes are not powers of two.\n\nDeque::with_capacity is also implemented, but .reserve() is not yet done.\n",
