    "body": "This is not a bug, in the sense that the type system is working as designed. I do not think you can design an iterator that _owns content_ and gives out pointers to it, at least not using the current iterator trait. To do so, you'd have to modify the iterator trait to always give out `&T` (where T is its type parameter), which rules out \"by-move\" iterators.\n\nIn this case, though, I think you don't need any lifetimes. I would implement `Repeat` as:\n\n```\npub struct Repeat<T> { val: T }\n\nimpl<T:Clone> Iterator<T> for Repeat<T> {\n    fn next(&self) -> Option<T> { Some(self.val.clone()) }\n} \n```\n\nIf `val` is not copyable, you can always make `Repeat::new(&the_value)`. I'm going to close this issue.\n\nType system geekery follows: If we did want to extend the type system to permit the kinds of things you are attempting to do -- and similar problems have arisen in other contexts -- I am honestly not sure how best to do it. The lifetime `'self` here corresponds to the lifetime of the callee, which is not \"in scope\" at the impl site -- it is only in scope at a particular call site. That's why the system is designed as it is. To make this work, presumably you would need some version of higher-kinded types, though how it could be unobtrusively packaged is a bit unclear to me. In that case, the type `T` that is iterated over would not just be a type but actually a `lifetime => T` type function. Gah. \n",

    "body": "The implementation of `Repeat` isn't particularly significant, I only used that because it was a trivial way to show the problem. The real issue here is my attempt to produce a `.chunk_iter()` iterator adaptor, that either yields up `&[A]` or yields a sub-iterator that iterates one chunk. Both approaches require the ability to attach a lifetime to `&self` and use that lifetime in the return value of the `next()` function.\n\nI fully admit that I don't perfectly grok lifetimes yet. What would be the fallout of allowing arbitrary lifetime bounds to be added to a trait function impl, i.e. `fn next<'r>(&'r self) -> Option<&'r [A]>`?\n",
