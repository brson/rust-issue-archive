    "body": "Hm, I think I tend to agree that ignoring poisoning is probably ok here. I was a little worried about this originally, but I think this works because you're right that the protected state is largely what it would affect and we know it can't panic (and we totally control it) so this should be fine.\n\nIf something like https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/973 is implemented I'd be a little more worried, but I think it's safe to say that for our own internally managed buffers we'll guarantee that a panic won't happen.\n\nr=me with a test added\n",
