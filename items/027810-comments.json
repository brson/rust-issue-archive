    "body": "I so far found a several problems with the API exposed currently:\n\nSome of the exposed methods are not cross-platform or might not do what\u2019s intended. Most notably the methods dealing with search pathes\u2026 On Windows it doesn\u2019t use [AddDllDirectory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh310513%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)/[SetDllDirectory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686203%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) and manipulates environment instead. Man pages claim that on unix `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` may not be accounted for in some reasons and as far as I interpret the text (didn\u2019t test, though) only the value of the variable as it was during process initialisation is used.\n\n`dlsym` returns `*mut void`, and `GetProcAddress` returns `FARPROC`. `*mut void` is a regular pointer and `FARPROC` is a function pointer. While POSIX-compiliance requires `*mut T` and function pointers be interchangeable, I couldn\u2019t find anything of a sort for Windows. That is, on POSIX-compiliant systems you can `dlsym` functions and statics and whatnot, while on Windows only function pointers can be safely retrieved.\n\nPublicly exposed `create_path` and `envvar` methods make no sense. Instead of `&Path`, `P: AsRef<Path>` should be taken and symbols are not utf-8 therefore `&str` in `symbol` is a no-go.\n\nFinally, I feel like there should be a simple way to prevent using symbols after the library is dropped, by e.g. returning `&'library mut T`? I\u2019m experimenting with that.\n",
