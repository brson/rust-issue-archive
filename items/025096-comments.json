    "body": "@XuefengWu something has gone wrong with the Git history here. I'm afraid we can't merge this as is. On local branches, it is usually better to use `rebase` rather than `merge` (`merge` can work too, but it is easier to get wrong and the history doesn't look as nice). To fix this, I would recommend starting a new branch from master and `cherry-pick`ing the commits from this branch. Then force push that branch to this remote: `git push origin new_branch_name:24968_err_msg_parse_self_type`. You can use `git rebase -i` to squash commits together or to reword commit messages (I note that the last commit here has a typo in 'keyword'). Let me know if you need more help with the git stuff, or ask on #rust-internals.\n",
