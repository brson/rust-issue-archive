Converting all the diagnostics to have codes is tempting but maybe we should instead do it on an individual basis when we're confident a diagnostic is going to stay. I reckon all the language changes before 1.0 will have significant impact on the stability of these.\n",

I personally see the error codes as frozen for life once emitted, but I have a feeling we can continue to add digits in the future if necessary, or even change letters, so I don't think we have to worry too much about wasting some codes here and there.\n",
