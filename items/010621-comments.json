    "body": "So, I shamefully bow my head for not having run the full test suite.\n\nFor future reference:\nWhat goes wrong here is that `src/test/pretty/block-comment-wchar.rs` uses `U+180E MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR` to test folding of adjacent white space characters (@pnkfelix Do you remember why you used that particular character for this test?).\nIn Unicode 6.3 that character is no longer considered white space.\n\nWhile looking at this I also noticed that `char::is_whitespace()`, as well as `char::is_uppercase()` and `char::is_lowercase()`, do not conform to the respective definition in the Unicode Standard. White_Space is not a derived property, as the current code would have you believe, this is also the reason why `U+0085 NEXT LINE` is currently not considered white space.\n\nI'm going to start on a fix for the later. For the testcase I'm not entirely sure what an appropriate change would be, since I'm not certain which property of `U+180E MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR` made it desirable for this test.\n",

    "body": "@Florob I think I picked out `U+180E` because it is (or was) a whitespace character that:\n1. uses multiple bytes in its UTF-8 representation (and thus exposes the bug described in #3961), and\n2. has a non-whitespace presentation in my editor of choice (emacs) and on my terminal, and thus one can directly see the different combinations explored in the test (for example the 16 cases of strings of length 2 over the alphabet { space, monoglian-vowel-sep }).  And in addition, another small benefit is/was:\n3. On my Emacs with my default font, the width of monoglian-vowel-sep appears to be approximately equal to that of a space character, and so the columns happen to align nicely in the presentation.\n\nHowever, if it is no longer whitespace, then obviously the above reasoning is irrelevant.  The most important thing is that the characters in the supposed-whitespace should actually _be_ whitespace.\n\nI think `U+1680     ogham space mark` would then be a suitable replacement for the mongolian-vowel-separator in those tests.  Property 3 above does not hold for it, but that was just a random choice; its more important to make sure 1 and 2 work.\n",
