Are you still planning on completing this? Not volunteering because I don't personally run Windows, just trying to see if there's any progress. Sounds like a pretty significant change and I can't see anything particular holding it back, so it would be nice to see someone finish this off.\n",

It would also completely destroy the notion of ever using Rust for the sort of games that currently require C++. I know we don't currently have a milestone for 1.0, but I'm tempted to reassign this to \"backwards-compatible\" just to ensure that it doesn't slip.\n",

    "body": "#8488 and #8840 enabled rustc to cross-build for mingw-w64. With [cross-built `rustrt.dll` and `std-<hash>.dll`](https://gist.github.com/klutzy/6349568) inside `rustc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/`, your rustc can build 64-bit exe.\n\nWhat's missing now:\n- morestack. I think it is not so hard, but GS register holds stack range thus it should be maintained.\n- stack unwinding. In 64-bit windows, there are two methods available: SJLJ and SEH. (no dwarf!) Also note that win32 SEH and win64 SEH are totally different. I guess llvm supports SJLJ but no SEH. (See also @thadguidry's comment on #7953) SEH is better, so we have to use it before 1.0 lands.\n\nAlso, I think it's better to use mingw-w64 for both win32/win64, to minimize platform difference (e.g. #8663).\n",

It means plain `make` crashes during stage2.\n- unwinding didn't work. task failure led process exit.\n\n(I used mingw-builds x64 + win32 threads + seh unwinding.)\nCurrently `src/libstd/rt/unwind.rs` may need `__gcc_personality_seh0` patch, but I guess the status has not changed much.\n",

It seems that the culprit is libgreen: when I switched compiletest to use libnative, it got through many tests, though in the end it hung - after complaining about task 'receiving on a closed channel'.\n- ~~debug info is broken~~ - nevermind: line numbers are also broken in the latest nightly \n\nI've published the current state of my repo in on github: https://github.com/vadimcn/rust/commits/Win64.  To build it you'll need to fetch LLVM master and run configure --build=x86_64-w64-mingw32.\n",
