But also probably need not distract core dev?\n\nUpdate: I did look at pdcurses while on vacation.  It is seemed to be a strange beast; in particular, it advertises support for unusual places (windows, dos, etc), but the support for unix hosts appeared to be limited to just x11; I was not able to get it to target a non-x11 console on my XO's vt100 terminal (and thus you'd still need to use something like terminfo when you were not running atop x11).\n\nDoes this jibe with others understandings of pdcurses, i.e., that it is not meant to be a uniform replacement for terminfo, but rather a configure-time selected alternative to terminfo?\n",
