    "body": "OK, so I spent some time digging into this. I don't think that deferring numeric fallback is necessarily the solution. @edwardw sorry if I kept disappearing on IRC, I had to put my head down and study the log to see what was happening.\n\nSo what seems to happen is that we correctly come up with the constraint:\n1. `<Range<_#0i> as Iterator>::Item == u8`\n\nHowever, we are unable to make the connection between `u8` and `_#0i`. The reason is that the new `::ops::Range` has separate impls for each of the numeric types, whereas the old `Range` had only impl for a type `A:Int`. When we process the projections, we first try to resolve `Range<_#0i> as Iterator` (without considering the output type `Item`), and we get ambiguity, because there are many impls that could apply.\n\nUnfortunately this all seems a bit right to me. Basically we're trying to infer the type of the range from the output type, which is the reverse direction inference is supposed to go.\n\nWhen we used a blanket impl, we were able to resolve this because there was only one impl for `Range`. Probably the best fix is to go back to that, actually, but this is an interesting quandry. I'll have to think about it a bit.\n",

    "body": "After some discussion with @aturon on RFC, I just wanted to clarify a few things (I myself was a touch confused too).\n1. Changing the impl is probably the easiest way to fix this in the short term.\n2. However, to some extent, this limitation is an artifact of how trait matching is implemented. That is, we intentionally do not take output bindings into account when selecting traits. However, it doesn't _have_ to be this way, but it'd take some work to massage the trait matching infrastructure, since impl selection doesn't presently have access to output binding information, that'd have to be propagated inward. It might be interesting to try and address this in a more wholistic way (i.e., something that accounts for the full set of facts that are registered). \n3. In particular, the important constraint that we MUST maintain is that, during trans, given the input types, we can derive the output type. But it's permissible for us to use the output type to derive the input type during type checking, since once inference is done, we then have the input types to supply during trans so that we can rederive the output. \n",
