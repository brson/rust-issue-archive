They're a normal non-forking process, and _can_ be augmented to notify the init system of readiness or make use of socket activation.\n\nThere's absolutely no way for forking daemons to avoid race conditions. They can be reliably killed via control groups on Linux, but there's no non-racy/non-polling way to do supervision.\n",
