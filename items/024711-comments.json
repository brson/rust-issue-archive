    "body": "@lambda \n\nThanks [for the info](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/24711#discussion_r28937068)! I'm moving discussion out here as your comment is now collapsed. This actually poses some difficulties and the current solution makes me feel uncomfortable. There are currently two methods of acquiring a `FileType`, one through `DirEntry` and the other through `FileAttr` (speaking in `fs2` terms). The `DirEntry` one knows whether it's a symlink or not (by reading the `dwReserved0` field you mentioned), but the `FileAttr` does not).\n\nThere are a few places which we can get a `FileAttr`:\n- `DirEntry::metadata` - this is fine as it already knows whether it's a symlink or not\n- `File::metadata` - this is problematic as to learn about whether the file is a symlink it requires a syscall\n- `lstat` - this is less problematic as we can switch to using `FindFirstFile` as you mentioned, but it is somewhat unnerving that accidental `*` or `?` characters in the path could produce some odd results.\n- `stat` - this suffers the same problems as `File::metadata` and `lstat`\n\nOverall this basically means that we need to have an extra syscall or some different semantics (which now makes me worry about `read_dir`...). This is an unfortunate deviation for what may not be that important all the time, so I suppose it suffices to say that I'm glad that these functions are `#[unstable]` for now!\n\nRegardless, though, I think the current implementation is at least \"more correct\", although I'm not convinced that we actually want it!\n",

    "body": "I think that the latest approach that you've added looks fine, and I think that the abstraction is reasonable; having to spend an extra syscall to find out if a file is a symlink or not doesn't seem unreasonable, especially since you only pay that extra cost for reparse points, which should be fairly rare. And I think your current approach is fine, you're right, there are some concerns using `FindFirstFile` so this way of doing it should be fine.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not a Windows expert; I just noticed the problem since I'd been reading the documentation closely while reviewing rust-lang/rfcs#1044 and writing rust-lang/rfcs#1048. @retep998 do you have any opinion on this, you seem to have the most Windows API experience?\n",
