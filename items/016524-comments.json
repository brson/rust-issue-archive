    "body": "I may have written the FIXME, and probably I was thinking that it was 'archaic' to bubble up unixy I/O error codes with an ancient legacy and loose mapping to non-unixes.\n\nIn hindsight I'm no longer too concerned about that. The names have been mostly well-rustified, and they are abstracted across platform reasonably well by virtue of the I/O stack being implemented cross-platform, and libuv already having done much of the error-unifying work for us.\n\nAnother concern is that the list of possible errors is static.\n\nThe naming of the variants should be scrutinized.\n",
