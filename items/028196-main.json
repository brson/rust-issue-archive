The compiler resolves this ambiguity by forbidding variable bindings that occur in match patterns from shadowing names of variants that are in scope. For example, wherever **List** is in scope, a match pattern would not be able to bind **Nil** as a new name.\n\nNil and List are not mentioned in the previous example\n",
