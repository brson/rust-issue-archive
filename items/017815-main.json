  "body": "The representability-checking routine `is_type_representable` failed to detect structural recursion in some cases, leading to stack overflow later on.\n\nThe first problem was in the loop in the `find_nonrepresentable` function. We were improperly terminating the iteration if we saw a `ContainsRecursive` condition. We should have kept going in case a later member of the struct (or enum, etc) being examined was `SelfRecursive`. The example from #17431 triggered this issue:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::sync::Mutex;\nstruct Foo { foo: Mutex<Option<Foo>> }\nimpl Foo { fn bar(self) {} }\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nI'm not 100% sure, but I think the `ty_enum` case of `fn type_structurally_recursive` had a similar problem, since it could `break` on `ContainsRecursive` before looking at all variants. I've replaced this with a `flat_map` call.\n\nThe second problem was that we were failing to identify code like `struct Foo { foo: Option<Option<Foo>> }` as SelfRecursive, even though we correctly identified `struct Foo { foo: Option<Foo> }`. This was caused by using DefId's for the `ContainsRecursive` check, which meant the nested `Option`s were identified as illegally recursive (because `ContainsRecursive` is not an error, we would then keep compiling and eventually hit a stack overflow).\n\nIn order to make sure that we can recurse through the different `Option` invocations, I've changed the type of `seen` from `Vec<DefId>` to `Vec<t>` and added a separate `same_type` function to check whether two types are the same when generics are taken into account. Now we only return `ContainsRecursive` when this stricter check is satisfied. (There's probably a better way to do this, and I'm not sure my code is entirely correct--but my knowledge of rustc internals is pretty limited, so any help here would be appreciated!)\n\nNote that the `SelfRecursive` check is still comparing `DefId`s--this is necessary to prevent code like this from being allowed:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo { x: Bar<Foo> }\nstruct Bar<T> { x: Bar<Foo> }\n```\n\nAll four of the new `issue-17431` tests cause infinite recursion on master, and errors with this pull request. I wrote the extra `issue-3008-4.rs` test to make sure I wasn't introducing a regression.\n\nFixes #17431.\n",
