For example, [run-pass/mod_file_aux.rs](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/mod_file_aux.rs), which says `xfail-test Not a test. Used by other tests`. Is there a better way to indicate \"not a test\" than `xfail-test`? (It's reasonable for there not to be, since it's probably a very small category; just annoying for the uninitiated looking for tests to fix.)\n",

For the one in the case of 912, it sounds like it just needs to get removed.\n",
