    "body": "Some of them could be moves, it's more the `opt_*` functions requiring copies, I can't see anything that alters the matches. To some extent I imagine the matches to be completely immutable and therefore the idea that I need to copy it around seems... ugly.\n\nI think it's just a side-effect from implicit copy being either a warning or error now (not sure which), where as before it was silent. I think it's better to make it explicit, but also re-working the functions, especially `libstd` functions to avoid copying would be nice as well.\n",

    "body": "I'm about to submit a pull request to change the `opt_` functions to take references to a vector matches, which obviates the need for copying. For example, this will work:\n\n```\nextern mod std;\n\nuse std::getopts::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    let args = ~[];\n    let opts = ~[optopt(~\"b\")];\n\n    match getopts(args, opts) {\n        result::Ok(ref m)  =>\n            assert !opt_present(m, \"b\"),\n        result::Err(f) => fail fail_str(f)\n    };\n\n}\n```\n\nTwo things to watch out for : you have to use the `ref` keyword when matching on the result of `getopts`, and since the result will be a borrowed pointer into the argument vector to `getopts`, you have to use it within the proper scope (above, I'm using it in the action for the first pattern in the `match`, but I wouldn't be able to use it outside the `match`).\n",
