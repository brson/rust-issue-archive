  "body": "This is an implementation of the rustc bits of [RFC 403](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/403). This adds a new\nflag to the compiler, `-l`, as well as tweaking the `include!` macro (and\nrelated source-centric macros).\n\nThe compiler's new `-l` flag is used to link libraries in from the command line.\nThis flag stacks with `#[link]` directives already found in the program. The\npurpose of this flag, also stated in the RFC, is to ease linking against native\nlibraries which have wildly different requirements across platforms and even\nwithin distributions of one platform. This flag accepts a string of the form\n`NAME[:KIND]` where `KIND` is optional or one of dylib, static, or framework.\nThis is roughly equivalent to if the equivalent `#[link]` directive were just\nwritten in the program.\n\nThe `include!` macro has been modified to recursively expand macros to allow\nusage of `concat!` as an argument, for example. The use case spelled out in RFC\n403 was for `env!` to be used as well to include compile-time generated files.\nThe macro also received a bit of tweaking to allow it to expand to either an\nexpression or a series of items, depending on what context it's used in.\n\nCloses https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18473\n",
