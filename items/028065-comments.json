    "body": "The way the CRT on Windows handles `atexit` is it just has a table of all the `atexit` handlers, and when you call the CRT's `exit` it goes through and executes all the handlers and then calls `ExitProcess` (or `TerminateProcess` for windows store apps). Since Rust currently calls `ExitProcess` directly, that means using the libc `atexit` is useless since its handlers will never fire. However, it also means we can easily get `rt::atexit` to work with `process::exit` by just having `process::exit` call the `rt::cleanup` method (with some sort of synchronization to ensure it is only called once).\n",
