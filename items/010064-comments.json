    "body": "Cool! This should definitely be discussed. Some thoughts:\n- This looks like the signature is being allowed on all functions, not just extern ones?\n- It seems like a very unsafe operation to call any variadic function, the types don't appear to be checked (of the variadic arguments).\n- If you can define a variadic rust function, it doesn't look like you have the ability to access the variadic arguments?\n- I agree that tests are necessary!\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton  I just put the variadic flag on `FnSig` because it was easier than special casing it and it does make sense since I would say it being variadic is a part of its signature. Also, this doesn't parse for non-foreign functions so you can't define a variadic rust function. Notice I changed the `parse_fn_decl` in the parser to take a flag to indicate whether it should parse `...` but that flag is only set for foreign fns in an extern block. This is only to allow interop with foreign variadic functions like printf. I don't think there are any plans to allow var args for rust functions.\n",

I made a few comments inline about things that should be updated. but the biggest thing is that I think we need more and better tests.\n\nFirst, we should test the type system parts better:\n- The test that calls variadic functoins should not call printf but rather `sprintf` or something similar, so that we can test that the results look correct. Right now I have no idea.\n- A test where a variadic function is called indirectly. This also tests the syntax being parsed. Something like:\n\n```\nfn foo(f: extern \"C\" fn(*c_char, ...)) { ... }\nfn main() {\n    foo(sprintf);\n}\n```\n- Some tests in `compile_fail` where we try to use `extern \"C\" fn(uint, ...)` where `extern \"C\" fn(uint)` is expected and vice versa. \n\nr+ with tests added and comments addressed.\n",
