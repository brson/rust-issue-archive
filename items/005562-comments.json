    "body": "I am 99% sure I know the origin of this problem. As part of my fix for #5910, I encountered several of these copies at locations where hashtables were being mutated while being iterated. This was going undetected due to numerous bugs in the `@mut` write guard code. Therefore, I am going to close this bug as a dup of #5910.\n",
