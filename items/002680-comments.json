    "body": "This is necessary. When switching to the c stack sp_limit is set to 0, so it must be restored before going back to rust.\n\nThe sp_limit needs to be 0 when running on the C stack, so that when crust functions get called, their wrappers don't inadvertently trigger while on the C stack (which can corrupt the \"state machine\" of saving prev_c_sp and prev_rust_sp, frighteningly).\n\nBy the way, I am moving these to rust_task.h as part of the tls push.
