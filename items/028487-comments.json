    "body": ">If that's up for discussion, would this be best handled in RFC-land?\r\n\r\nI don't think it is, as it'd be a breaking change.\r\n\r\n> (especially given that The Book does not appear to cover this explicitly).\r\n\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/unsized-types.html\r\n\r\n> All generic type parameters implicitly have the Sized bound, so the ?Sized can be used to opt-out of the implicit bound.\r\n\r\nThe diagnostic is also slightly different today:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> error[E0277]: the trait bound `Self: std::marker::Sized` is not satisfied\r\n  --> <anon>:10:5\r\n   |\r\n10 |       fn res(&self) -> A<Self> {\r\n   |  _____^ starting here...\r\n11 | |         A { a: self.s() }\r\n12 | |     }\r\n   | |_____^ ...ending here: the trait `std::marker::Sized` is not implemented for `Self`\r\n   |\r\n   = help: consider adding a `where Self: std::marker::Sized` bound\r\n   = note: required by `A`\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven all this, and the lack of comments in 18 months, I think that we don't need to keep this issue open.
