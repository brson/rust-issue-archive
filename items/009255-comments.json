Also as you'll note @pcwalton did suggest something like `'TRAI'u32` as the syntax, so maybe this should be rewritten as a new type of literal using the char literal syntax (I already want to add support for things like `'a'u8` anyway).\n",

    "body": "After attempting to implement `'TRAI'` as a valid 4-char constant, I don't think it's possible to do that given our use of ' for lifetimes. `'foo,'bar` could be lexed as two comma-separated lifetimes, or as a 4-char constant followed by the characters \"bar\" (which is, of course, invalid). So I think `fourcc!()` is the only way to do this. Perhaps we can fix macros to support syntax extensions?\n",
