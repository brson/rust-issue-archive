  "body": "The first commit message is pretty good, but whomever reviews this should probably also at least glance at the changes I made in LLVM. I basically reorganized our pending patch queue to be a bit more organized and clearer in what needs to go where. After this, our queue would be:\n- Add the `no-split-stack` attribute\n- Add the `fixedstacksegment` attribute\n- Add split-stacks for arm android\n- Add split-stacks for arm linux\n- Add split stacks for mips\n\nThen there's a patch which I added to get rust to build at all on LLVM-head, and I'm not quite sure why it's there, but nothing seems to be crashing for now! (famous last words).\n\nOtherwise, I just updated code to reflect the changes I made in LLVM with the only major change being the advent of the new `no_split_stack` attribute. This is work towards #1226, but someone more familiar with the code should probably actually assign the attribute to the appropriate functions.\n\nAlso as a bonus, I've verified that this closes #5774\n",
