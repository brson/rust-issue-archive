Obviously having stack probes is better than not, but I'm not going to be kept awake by the removal of morestack.\n",

    "body": "Big :+1: to both the idea and the code. The continued existence of `__morestack` confused me a lot, and it was never clear how to implement the `stack_exhausted` lang-item.\n\nThat said, I do agree with the wariness about removing this from Linux while stack probes aren't present. (I'm still not totally sure what's the blocker, as in why MIPS can't use generic stack probing, but let's have that conversation on #16012.) I am concerned about whether this makes it easy to write \"safe\" code (that is, code that doesn't use `unsafe`) that messes with memory: see [my writeup](https://ldpreload.com/blog/stack-smashes-you) of doing this in well-defined C, and in particular [CVE-2010-2240](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2010/08/skeletons-hidden-in-linux-closet.html), which uses attacker-controlled recursion in the X server, plus MIT-SHM, to gain local root on Linux. (It did rely on coaxing the kernel into not generating a guard page, since each function happened to use less than a page of stack space.) If there's no current protection on Windows, meh, but if stack probes are present on Windows but not Linux, then I think removing explicit stack checks on Linux would be unfortunate. If we can quickly get generic stack probes in on all architectures, that sounds like the right approach.\n\nThat said, if there's already a way for malicious code to deliberately violate memory safety without `unsafe` in pure Rust, which I think @nagisa said there is, I don't think I can complain about there being another way to do it.\n\nI don't think custom split stacks are a compelling reason to keep this code around; I agree this is the right long-term thing to do.\n",
