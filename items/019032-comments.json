Really, it has to do with the fact that current coherence rules are designed so that, when implementing `Foo`, we don't have to consider if this (indirectly) violates coherence for some other trait `Bar`. (In this case, `Foo` is `FnMut` and `Bar` is `FnOnce`).\n",

    "body": "I agree with your concerns, but still lean on the side of enabling overloading. I think the most complex thing to deal with if we do enable overloading will be dealing with conflicting blanket implementations, for instance if I write this impl:\n\n``` rust\nimpl<F: Fn(X) -> Y> SomeTrait for F { ... }\n```\n\nI cannot also write this impl:\n\n``` rust\nimpl<F: Fn(X, Y) -> Z> SomeTrait for F { ... }\n```\n\neven though in practice they almost never conflict. As a result, we'd need negative trait bounds, and we'd need to put a lot of them (`O(n^2)` in the number of such impls).\n",

    "body": "I've been giving this a lot of thought. I no longer believe that the args/ret-types of the fn traits should be associated types. The reason is that having them as associated types is a problem in higher-ranked situations, since in that case the lifetime must be specified by the caller. Consider an example like `Fn(&int) -> int`:\n\n```\nimpl<'a> Fn for SomeType {\n    type Arg = (&'a int,);\n    type Ret = int;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nHere, the parameter `'a` is in violation of the rules from https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/447. This is because, basically, it is not actually an output of the impl, but an input. Trying to make this work causes all manner of problems in the associated types impl (believe me, I know). \n\nNote that we could make `'a` an input by having it appear on the input type:\n\n```\nimpl<'a> Fn for SomeType<'a> { .. }\n```\n\nBut now, for any given instance of `SomeType`, it can only be called with some particular `'a`. To do otherwise, we'd need higher-ranked references to structures. This is certainly thinkable but I don't want to think it right now.\n\nI'm busy right now so I'll stop this here. Obviously we'll have to address this issue, I have some thoughts on how to do it but I want to work them out a bit (short version is to have coherence be more liberal).\n",

Why are higher-ranked lifetimes with `struct`s significantly harder than with `fn`s and `trait`s?

    "body": "I closed #30191 as a dup of this issue. I wanted to reproduce a lightly edited version of the salient comments for posterity:\n\n---\n\n@arielb1 wrote this example, which was intended to demonstrate where the overlap rules were being too strict:\n\n``` Rust\nstruct Row;\n\npub trait FromSql<A> {}\n\npub trait FromSqlRow<A> {\n    fn foo(&self);\n}\n\nimpl<ST, T> FromSqlRow<ST> for T where\n    T: FromSql<ST>,\n{\n    fn foo(&self) {}\n}\n\nstruct User;\n\nimpl<ST> FromSqlRow<ST> for User where\n    (i32, String): FromSqlRow<ST>\n{\n    fn foo(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nbut as he and I later concluded, the orphan check is doing the right thing here. The danger is that a downstream crate might do something like:\n\n```\nstruct Foo;\nimpl FromSql<Foo> for User { }\n```\n\nwhich they [are legally able to do](https://is.gd/87nOki), for better or worse.\n\nOne solution here would be to adopt one of the negative impl proposals (such as [what I describe in this gist](https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/d5fe4a4b5b075b3d0ec9)]) that would permit `impl<T> !FromSql<T> for User`, which presumably coherence could then make use of.\n",

Among other things, it implies a much more complex coherence check, since now an impl of `A` can directly interfere with an impl of `B`. It's also a subtle case of negative logic: by adding these impls, we are effectively declaring that `A` and `B` are mutually exclusive. I'd prefer to surface that logic more explicitly. \r\n",

The difference is that in the simpler, non-generic case, the local crate can verify that no impls of `A` exist for `i32` -- and in particular, for such an impl to exist, it would have to be added **in this crate**.\r\n\r\nIn the generic case, we can validate that no impls exist that the crate can see, but there may be other impls added in downstream crates. This implies that downstream crates would have to do their own checking as well on our behalf, and this is what we wanted to avoid.",
