    "body": "I recently encountered this problem while trying to work around the lack of object safety for the Iterator trait (and obviously making several mistakes in the process :-/ ). Here's a concrete toy example:\n\nCode:\n\n```\npub trait IntIterator {\n    fn next<'a>(&'a mut self) -> Option<&'a int>;\n}\nimpl<'a, T> IntIterator for T where T: Iterator<&'a int> {\n    fn next<'a>(&'a mut self) -> Option<&'a int> {\n        Iterator::next(self)\n    }\n}\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nError:\n\n```\na.rs:5:5: 7:6 help: consider using an explicit lifetime parameter as shown: fn next<'a>(&'a mut self) -> Option<&'a int>\na.rs:5     fn next<'a>(&'a mut self) -> Option<&'a int> {\na.rs:6         Iterator::next(self)\na.rs:7     }\na.rs:6:9: 6:29 error: mismatched types: expected `core::option::Option<&'a int>`, found `core::option::Option<&'a int>` (lifetime mismatch)\na.rs:6         Iterator::next(self)\n               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\na.rs:6:9: 6:29 error: mismatched types: expected `core::option::Option<&'a int>`, found `core::option::Option<&'a int>` (lifetime mismatch)\na.rs:6         Iterator::next(self)\n               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nerror: aborting due to 2 previous errors\n```\n\nBasically, afaict, `'a` is used a few times and there's no diagnostic saying, \"lol, dude, ya totally duped yo' names.\"\n",

    "body": "I've been bitten by this bug a couple of times lately, and had to flounder around trying things until it went away since it gives no hints.\nI'm not sure if this is the correct issue to report this, since my case is unrelated to shadowing lifetimes, however.\n\n```\nsrc/xserver.rs:193:27: 193:64 error: mismatched types:\n expected `libc::types::common::c95::c_void`,\n    found `libc::types::common::c95::c_void`\n(expected enum `libc::types::common::c95::c_void`,\n    found a different enum `libc::types::common::c95::c_void`) [E0308]\nsrc/xserver.rs:193                     data: transmute::<[c_long; 5],c_void>(data),\n```\n\nIn my code, I was setting XClientMessageEvent.data from [rust-xlib](https://github.com/servo/rust-xlib/blob/master/src/xlib.rs#L736) with a transmute to `c_void` since that is what the `unnamed_union2` type is defined as, along with what the compiler said it wanted the type as. The proper error would be if the compiler told me \"expected `unnamed_union2`\" opposed to `c_void`.\n\nI also got the same error for function arguments:\n\n```\nsrc/xserver.rs:196:74: 196:100 error: mismatched types:\n expected `*mut libc::types::common::c95::c_void`,\n    found `*mut libc::types::common::c95::c_void`\n(expected enum `libc::types::common::c95::c_void`,\n    found a different enum `libc::types::common::c95::c_void`) [E0308]\nsrc/xserver.rs:196                 XSendEvent(self.display, wind, 0 /*false*/, NoEventMask, (mess_ptr as *mut c_void));\n```\n\nIn this case, I'm calling [XSendEvent](https://github.com/servo/rust-xlib/blob/master/src/xlib.rs#L1773) and it's saying the `*mut c_void` I'm passing it for arg4 isn't the correct type. The XEvent struct is another C union defined as `c_void`. In this case, it was difficult to fix the error since calling the function with `*mut XClientWindowEvent` would tell me I need a `*mut c_void`, while in reality it needs a `*mut XEvent`.\n\nI assume this is some kind of problem with Rust telling me the backed type for the exported type, instead of the proper name, and possibly because of how Rust doesn't support C-style unions and so have to be implemented as improper-sized `c_void` types...\n",
