    "body": "You can find some previous discussion of adding various sorting algorithms in #15380, but the [conclusion there](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15380#issuecomment-47989811) was that the stdlib should provide one general-purpose sort and we should perhaps have an optional/external crate which provides more specialized sorting such as this.\n\nThis isn't the exact same as #15380, however, but I would likely fall on the same side of the line as the discussion in that PR.\n",

    "body": "I can accept not including this from a simplicity perspective. I've personally run into several contexts where resorting is valuable, but I can certainly understand viewing it as niche. \n\nHonestly, my primary motivation is that it's just _there_. We've implemented it, but relegated it to working on small inputs internally. I don't think it would introduce much maintenance expense, since basically any algorithm we use for `sort` would love to have it as a subroutine for small inputs.\n\nThat, and the _orders of magnitude_ performance gain that one gets when it's appropriate. In contrast to the debate between quicksort and mergesort, insertion sort fills a very different niche.\n\nRegardless, I bow to the will of core maintainers. I'll leave this open for a bit in the interest of discussion. Unless a clear counter-position forms, I'll likely close this in a day or two.\n",

    "body": "@arthurprs One example I had was a naive maintenance of object ordering in a dynamic environment with unpredictable movement. For instance a z-buffer for render-order in a game. You need the full ordering whenever it's requested, and if it's requested frequently, you can reasonably expect that relative ordering hasn't changed much. So just insertion-sort the old ordering, and you're golden. If elements are added or removed, you just append them to the end, or swap_pop them, each one introducing at most O(n) inversions each. If number of entities is fairly static, this is tolerable.\n",
