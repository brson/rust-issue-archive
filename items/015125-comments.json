    "body": "This appears to be a problem with autoderef. For example, this code compiles just fine:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::sync::Arc;\n\ntrait TestTrait: Clone {}\n\npub struct Shared {\n    pub thing: Arc<Box<TestTrait + Send + Share>>\n}\n\nfn clone<T: Clone>(t: &T) -> T { t.clone() }\n\nimpl Clone for Shared {\n    fn clone(&self) -> Shared {\n        Shared {\n            thing: clone(&self.thing),\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn other words, the error is legitimate, you're just not calling the method you expecting. It appears the invocation of `clone()` is jumping to `Clone::<Self>::clone` rather than `Clone::<Arc<Self>>::clone`.\n",
