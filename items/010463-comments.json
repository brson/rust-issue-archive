    "body": "I like this idea! I'd want to make sure it could actually be supported though. Right now the main use cases for a \"working directory\" that I can think of are:\n- change_dir - this can _definitely_ become task-local\n- process spawning - we can make this task-local by always specifying the new cwd (never let it be null)\n- making paths absolute - this is already defined in rust, so we can make this use the task-local current directory\n\nI believe that we can make a transition to a task-level current-working directory with those use cases. That being said, we shouldn't throw away the ability to change the os-level current working directory. Perhaps `unsafe fn os::raw::setcwd(p: &Path)` or something like that.\n",

    "body": "I'm wondering about the coverage of the use-cases that @alexcrichton outlined. The cwd is essentially a bit of process-level state that any system call might use. It's not obvious that we can make it task-local while retaining the right semantics for system calls.\n\nFor example, we have a lot of functions in modules like `std::io::fs` that take `Path` values but pass their string data down to an underlying system call without turning them into absolute paths. The underlying system calls will then use the process-level cwd. Presumably, we would instead want the task-local cwd to be used, but that may be difficult in general:\n-  We'd need to make all paths absolute using the task-local cwd before invoking syscalls. That's probably OK, though we'd have to be careful to ensure that doing so doesn't change the semantics.\n- More worrying, do we always know when something is a path? If we ever pass a string down to a syscall that interprets it as a cwd-relative path, without making it absolute ourselves, we'd be in trouble. One place this happens is in process spawning, but there we could set the process-level cwd. But there may be other places, too.\n- Are the system calls for which the process-level cwd is important, where there's no way to provide an absolute path (say, because they are not taking any path as input)?\n",
