    "body": "So today I pushed this to `try`, and [linux passed](http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/try-linux/builds/507), but [windows has problems](http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/try-win/builds/512/steps/compile/logs/stdio) after [brson's patch](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/commit/66bd0f6c00811cd81b95d805f9eda0de4a6a5301).\n\ncmr on irc pointed out that [the file in question for llvm](http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/Valgrind_8cpp_source.html) may not be getting included correctly? I took a glance at LLVM, and it didn't look like it was possible for it to not be included. It also appeared that the same guard for these functions is in both the [header](http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/Valgrind_8h_source.html) and [source file](http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/Valgrind_8cpp_source.html).\n\nI'm not exactly sure how to debug this. I don't think this could be a problem with llvm not having cleaned itself entirely or something like that. There's also an ominous warning printed out during configuration of llvm: `LLVM will be built thread-unsafe because atomic builtins are missing`, although when I looked into that, it didn't appear as if it would cause this kind of build failure.\n\nI found [some previous issue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2129263/how-to-build-llvm-using-gcc-4-on-windows) about where `--disable-threads` fixes some issues on mingw/msys. I know very little about building on windows. @brson, do you have any ideas about perhaps whether this is just a build problem with the currently LLVM? Otherwise, if you have more info about the windows build setup, I can look some more into that.\n",

    "body": "Hmm... I investigated this a bit more, and I think that the `clean-llvm` flag isn't actually cleaning everything. I just re-ran the build again to make sure, but the relevant file is located in `lib/Support`, but the logs say:\n\n```\nmake[2]: Entering directory `/c/bot/slave/try-win/build/obj/llvm/i686-pc-mingw32/lib/Support'\nmake[2]: Nothing to be done for `all'.\nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/c/bot/slave/try-win/build/obj/llvm/i686-pc-mingw32/lib/Support'\n```\n\nSo this appears that the relevant file just isn't being recompiled. If there's another flag to force removal of everything, I could try that as well. If the llvm build directory were cleaned that may also help.\n",
