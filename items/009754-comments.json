    "body": "In case anyone else is curious, it is not too hard to override choices like this from the `make` invocation itself, without editing any of the makefiles themselves (changes that you would have to remember to revert before commiting/merging/etc), in order to select the old `-Awarnings` in stage 0 and thus quiet down the builds (which have been noisy in recent days due to the `deprecated_owned_vector` warning that is unrecognized in stage0).\n\nThe way I do it is:\n\n```\nmake -j8 --environment-overrides WFLAGS_ST0=-Awarnings\n```\n",
