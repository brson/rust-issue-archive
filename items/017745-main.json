  "body": "[Previously](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/e5da6a71a6a0b46dd3630fc8326e6d5906a1fde6), the `Any` trait was split into a private portion and an (empty) public portion, in order to hide the implementation strategy used for downcasting. However, the [new rules](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/e9ad12c0cae5c43ada6641c7dc840a0fbe5010a2) for privacy forbid `AnyPrivate` from actually being private.\n\nThis patch thus reverts the introduction of `AnyPrivate`.\n\nAlthough this is unlikely to break any real code, it removes a public trait and is therefore a:\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
