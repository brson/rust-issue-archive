    "body": "So this is really a mixture of two issues: export order change (`pub use consts::win32;` is higher than `mod win32 {}`) and impossibility to use `mod win32`.\nI'm ok with the first change, but then we should move `mod win32` somewhere. Actually it contains only two fns: `pub fn fill_utf16_buf_and_decode` and `pub fn as_utf16_p`. They are not win32-dependent, but just win32-convenient. How about moving them to `str` and export them for all os?\n",
