  "body": "Now that procedural macros can be implemented outside of the compiler,\nit's more important to have a reasonable API to work with. Here are the\nbasic changes:\n- Rename SyntaxExpanderTTTrait to MacroExpander, SyntaxExpanderTT to\n  BasicMacroExpander, etc. I think \"procedural macro\" is the right\n  term for these now, right? The other option would be SynExtExpander\n  or something like that.\n- Stop passing the SyntaxContext to extensions. This was only ever used\n  by macro_rules, which doesn't even use it anymore. I can't think of\n  a context in which an external extension would need it, and removal\n  allows the API to be significantly simpler - no more\n  SyntaxExpanderTTItemExpanderWithoutContext wrappers to worry about.\n",
