The underscore style is also deeply entrenched in the 'rustic' coding style, so it's probably better you get used to it now if you want to be working with other devs.\n\nI've mostly used camelCase in the past so I really didn't take to the underscore style at first, but after using Rust for several months it has definitely grown on me.

It\u2019s not late to innovate with stuff like this.\n\nI know devs can be conservative when it comes to syntax, but just think about objective advantages of using hyphen-case.

    "body": "While I am a sympathetic, card carrying member of the Ancient Order Of Strange Old Lisp People, as are several Rust developers, Rust is lexically Not A Lisp in several different capacities, and not about to become one. We draw our identifier rule from Python, and more-recent adaptations of the C family lexeme rules to unicode. In particular, the XID_Start / XID_Continue pair.  'U+005F LOW LINE' is in class XID_Continue, whereas 'U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS' is not.\n\nSo no. Closing this on the basis that it's more or less arbitrary and we've already made this decision.
