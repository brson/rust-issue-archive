  "body": "This commit alters rustdoc to crawl the metadata of upstream libraries in order\nto fill in default methods for traits implemented in downstream crates. This,\nfor example, documents the `insert` function on hash maps.\n\nThis is a fairly lossy extraction from the metadata. Documentation and\nattributes are lost, but they aren't used anyway. Unfortunately, argument names\nare also lost because they are not present in the metadata. Source links are\nalso lost because the spans are not serialized.\n\nWhile not perfect, it appears that presenting this documentation through rustdoc\nis much better than nothing, so I wanted to land this to allow iteration on it\nlater on.\n",
