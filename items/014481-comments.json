    "body": "I'm not keen on the `Add` impl for string. It seems to easily encourage inefficient/overallocating code since it doesn't reuse the allocation of its argument, meaning `s = s + a` is horrible (especially in a loop). (And I relatively often see code approximately equivalent to that.)\n\nI would be very interested in waiting a little longer to see if not having it is just too unbearable.\n\n(Also this addition on strings isn't even commutative, i.e. it flies in the face of mathematical convention for the `+` operator. :P )\n",
