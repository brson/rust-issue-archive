  "body": "The older algorithm was pretty inefficient for big matches. Fixes #29227. (On my computer, MIR construction on this test case goes from 9.9s to 0.025s.) Whereas before we had a loop like:\n- for all outcomes of the test we are performing\n  - for all candidates\n    - check whether candidate is relevant to outcome\n\nWe now do:\n- for all candidates\n  - determine which outcomes the candidate is relevant to\n\nSince the number of outcomes in this case is proportional to the number of candidates, the original algorithm turned out to be O(n^2), and the newer one is just O(n).\n\nThis PR also does some minor speedups by eagerly mirroring all patterns, so that we can just pass around `&Pattern<'tcx>`, which makes cloning cheaper. We could probably go a bit further in this direction.\n\nr? @Aatch \n",
