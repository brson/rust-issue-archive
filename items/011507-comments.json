I appreciate all efforts to keep up-to-date and improve the docs.\n\nThe problem is, `po4a` takes multiple file paths via `po4a.conf` and puts multiple outputs to the paths that are declared in `po4a.conf`, so it is difficult to track dependencies from `make`. I think the localization part of `mk/docs.mk` needs more considerations. For now, `make docs-l10n` does nothing even if some files related to translation have been updated.\n",
