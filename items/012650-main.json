  "body": "Move std::rand to a separate rand crate\n\nThis functionality is not super-core and so doesn't need to be included\nin std. It's possible that std may need rand (it does a little bit now,\nfor io::test) in which case the functionality required could be moved to\na secret hidden module and reexposed by librand.\n\nUnfortunately, using #[deprecated] here is hard: there's too much to\nmock to make it feasible, since we have to ensure that programs still\ntypecheck to reach the linting phase.\n\nAlso, deprecates/removes `rand::rng` (this time using `#[deprecated]`), since it's too easy to accidentally use inside a loop, making things very slow (have to read randomness from the OS and seed the RNG each time.)\n",
