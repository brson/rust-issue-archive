  "body": "Remove the Sha1, Sha2, MD5, and MD4 algorithms. SipHash is also cryptographically secure hash function and IsaacRng is a cryptographically secure RNG - I left those alone but removed comments that implied they were suitable for cryptographic use. I thought that MD4 was used for something by the compiler, but everything still seems to work with it removed, so, I guess not.\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure about - workcache.rs and workcache_support.rs (in librustpkg) both depend on Sha1. Without Sha1, the only hash function left is SipHash, so I switched that code over to use SipHash. The output size of SipHash is only 64-bits, however - much less than 160 for Sha1. I'm not sure this is a problem. Without other cryptographic hashes in the tree, I'm not sure what else to do. I considered moved Sha1 into librustpkg, but I don't know if that makes sense.\n\nIf merged, this closes #9300.\n",
