  "body": "This commit changes our distribution and in-tree sources to pass the `-C rpath`\nflag by default during compiles. This means that from-source builds, including\nour release channels, will have this option enabled as well. Motivated\nby #29941, this change means that the compiler should be usable as-is on all\nplatforms just after extraction or installation. This experience is already true\non Windows but on Unixes you still need to set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH or the\nequivalent, which can often be unfortunate.\n\nThis option was originally turned off by default for Linux distributions who\ntend to take care of these sorts of details themselves, so it is expected that\nall those builds of Rust will want to pass `--disable-rpath` to the configure\nscript to preserve that behavior.\n\nCloses #29941\n",
