For example, `box 3+5` currently\nparses as `(box 3)+5` (which I feel is a bug but whatever), however\n`box +3` parses fine.\n\nI think what is confusing me a bit is that `..` as a unary operator\nhas a distinct precedence from other unary operators.\n\n> With `&&`, the situation is less clear -- whether the operator\n> precedence of `&&` is higher or lower than `..` depends on whether\n> we consider `&&` a binary operator or unary operator.

    "body": ">  I think what is confusing me a bit is that `..` as a unary operator has a distinct precedence from other unary operators.\n\nThere are two unary `..` operators: prefix and postfix forms. In fact, `..` is the only postfix operator in rust (not exactly true, strictly speaking function calls and indexing are also postfix operators).\nI think giving postfix `..` a different precedence than binary `..` would be confusing (why would the grouping of expressions on the LHS of `..` be affected by whether there's an expression on the RHS?).\nAt the same time, why should the two unary `..` operators have different precedences?\nIMHO the only sane solution is to give all three versions of `..` the same precedence, and that means it must be distinct from the other unary operators.\n\n> I understand the motivation, but it seems to be achieved by introducing a kind of arbitrary rule in the grammar, which I don't think is worth it.\n\nThe grammar is ambiguous with this choice of operator precedence for `..`. Resolving the ambiguity either way requires an arbitrary rule.\nDisambiguating the other way around would be less of a special case in the _implementation_, but I don't think we should base our decisions about the grammar based on what needs a little bit less code in a hand-written recursive-descent parser.\n\nIf anything, this is an argument that the choice of precedence for `..` is wrong, and we should pick one that does not cause an ambiguity. (for example, keep it at the same precedence as the assignment operator)\n\nThen again, we already have some other disambiguation decisions that are pretty specific to a recursive-descent parser implementation (for example, treating the `<` in `i as i32 < 10` as opening a type argument list -- a bottom-up parser would do this differently). :-(\n\nI should maybe separate this pull request into two PRs - one for fixing the grammar inconsistencies while keeping the current precedence (same as assignment operator), and another that increases the precedence to the level suggested here.\n",

    "body": "> That is, an operator with precedence N may not appear as operand of another operator with precedence greater than N without using parentheses.\n\nNote that I'd like to keep `..` to this rule because it feels like it makes the grammar more consistent (I feel like `i..` should be syntactically valid in the same contexts as `..i`). However, this is not a hard requirement. In fact, Rust already has another language construct violating this rule: lambda expressions.\n\n`a + b * || c * d + e` gets parsed as `a + (b * (|| ((c * d) + e)))`. But lambda expressions are commonly parsed this way in other languages (C# is exactly the same), so I think violating the rule is OK for lambdas.\n",
