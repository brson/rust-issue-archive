    "body": "As I understand, LLVM will scalarize vector types when SIMD is unavailable (see `LegalizeVectorTypes.cpp` and `LegalizeVectorOps.cpp`) or when it is cheaper (see `InstCombineVectorOps.cpp`). Of course it is not perfect. I think 16 is a reasonable cutoff for smallness; it's the maximum SIMD vector length for OpenCL.\n\nOn the other hand, should operators be overloaded for all fixed-length vectors, or just small fixed-length vectors (of appropriate types)? I don't think it is desirable that `+` is defined for `[int, ..16]` but not `[int, ..20]` or `[T, ..16]`. Another thing to consider is having vector types in a function signature seems to be able to crash LLVM (apparently some can't be done with ABI). I think fixed-length vectors won't be in the signature much, but it would be problematic for tuples.\n",

    "body": "Fascinating paper! I think it's beyond the scope of what we can get working in the 1.0 timeframe, honestly, but it is a promising looking extension to the language for ... some day.\n\nI think in the nearer term I'd prefer to approach this via a `#[simd]` or `[simd(4)]` attribute, yes. I don't know how best to factor platform dependency around that, and whether it's necessary to specify a vector size in the attribute as well as in the vector size itself. If LLVM is good at choosing target representations and operations, I would be happy to leave the task to it and just generate vectorized code for any fixed sized vectors marked with `#[simd]`.\n\nI don't think we have machinery to overload arithmetic on \"all\" fixed length vectors at the moment. I am not even sure if defining on _any_ fixed length vectors will work well; I suspect the type system will try to borrow a slice and dispatch to an overload on `&[]`. But if you can get it working on any of them, I don't mind restricting it to a fixed set of small sizes (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 say); these can be stamped out for different sizes using macros or similar techniques. It's a pretty specialized corner of the language and there are not actual hardware devices with abnormal (20, 27, 35, etc.) vector sizes to worry about.\n\nIt doesn't look like LLVM surfaces the entire repertoire of vector operations one might want to do in NEON or SSE; will we need to be putting bits of inline asm in the overloaded operators?\n",

    "body": "I discussed with sanxiyn on IRC. The following transcript shows the discussion:\n\nhttps://botbot.me/irc.mozilla.org/rust/msg/2799234/\n\nGeneral consensus points:\n- Using vector types (as I initially thought) is probably not wise since they support slice and element-address-taking in ways that SIMD never will. Either use an attribute-annotated scalar type or an attribute-annotated tuple type. Tuple types have the advantage of coming with a construct / destruct form. \n- tuple idioms like `let (x, y, _, _) = v; (x, x, y, y)` _might_ be recognizable at the LLVM level (or pattern-match / destructure / tuple-formation code in trans) as things like SIMD shuffles; investigate whether LLVM and/or trans can do so, as it is a nice tidy idiom.\n- iteration can be done by equipping a vector with an `.each_simd` method. This takes two functions, one that handles the header/trailer parts of the block (taking `T`) and one that handles the SIMD-body. Other possibilities involving a maybe-SIMD trait implemented by both `T` and `#[simd] (T,T,T,T)` are possible.\n",

    "body": "When I tried to implement an attribute approach, I encountered the problem that attributes are attached to AST nodes, not types. Nominal types (`enum`, `struct`, `trait`) have `def_id` (as they should) so you can check whether `struct` has a `packed` attribute, but structural types (like primitive types, vectors, tuples) don't (as they shouldn't: the interner avoids allocating same types) so you can't check whether they have a `simd` attribute. Maybe structural types should not be uniqed when attributes are attached?\n",
