    "body": "This isn't intended to work; associated types and methods can't be used in this way either, so this behavior is consistent with those cases, although I can see how `use` of associated constants would be convenient. I think that this has been proposed before, but AFAIK there hasn't been an RFC to allow `use` of associated items yet.\n\nA workaround would be to just declare a copy/alias of the constant in the scope where you wanted to `use` it:\n\n``` rust\nconst SUP: &'static str = Foo::SUP;\n```\n\nThis doesn't seem to work for associated types, though, so I should probably file a bug for that if there's not one already.\n",
