    "body": "Currently we are planning to remove the entire `intrinsics` module from the public-facing API of the standard library, in which case we may not want to add these at this time. I think that when adding these intrinsics they would also want to be exposed in a public-facing soon-to-be-stable location as well, but this sort of addition to the standard library requires an RFC.\n\nIn short, I believe that an RFC is needed for these changes. Feel free to open an issue in the RFC repo, and I could also help out with writing an RFC if you need it!\n",
