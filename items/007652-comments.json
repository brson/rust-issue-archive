    "body": "> Using &'static Node pointers for backlinks creates an infinite loop when you use fmt!(\"%?\"). Using raw pointers is just as easy, but Option<*Node> is 16 bytes while Option<&'static Node> is only 8.\n\nYou can use `*Node`, the reason it's 16 bytes is that it's already nullable. It's okay if `%?` is broken though because it shouldn't be usable on private fields without `unsafe`, and it's already broken on managed pointer graphs with cycles.\n",
