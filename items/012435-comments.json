I don't think there's much of a use case for a strict weak ordering trait in Rust's standard library.\n\n@brson: No, I haven't touched the floating point implementations yet. At the moment it's just an incorrect implementation, but since `std::hashmap` never actually used `TotalEq` it's not much of a step backwards. I opened a separate bug about floating point.\n\n@omasanori: If Semantic Versioning is unable to provide a basic guarantee like `!(a < b) && !(b < a)` implying that `a` and `b` are equal, then I don't think we should be using Semantic Versioning as that seems insane. If the build id is not considered to be relevant to version equality, then it should be considered separate from the version. Floating point at least has the excuse of NaN representing a lack of information, like SQL NULL.\n",

At the moment  I'm just doing an override of `cmp` and mentioning it in the documentation as something you should override when you can perform a single pass, or when it's a generic wrapper. Deriving now does the right thing and calls the underlying `cmp` too.\n",
