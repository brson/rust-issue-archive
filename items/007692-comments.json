    "body": "I was thinking about this awhile back. I think that the best way to go about doing this would be to just don't re-serialize moved variables. Basically after the user-input code is executed, detect if any of the local bound variables were moved, and don't reserialize them.\n\nThe bad part is that you can move out of a variable and then use it in a later statement, but this is purely a debugging repl so I don't think that it's too bad.\n",
