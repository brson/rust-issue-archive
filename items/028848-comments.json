    "body": "As we discussed briefly on IRC, I feel like logically the substs for an inherent impl _ought_ to contain an entry for `Self`. Basically I think we ought to strive to check things \"as if\" there were a trait involved, even if the actual mechanism differs. Another way to look at this is that there could be an implicit \"where\" clause on inherent impls that `Self WF` (which is obviously not syntax, but which IS a notion that rustc possesses). Yet a third way is that the \"path\" to the inherent impl references the `Self` type (and must thus be WF), even if it is not part of the _substitutions_. I'm not quite sure which of those three perspectives I like best.\n",
