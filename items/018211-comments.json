    "body": "> However, integer types don't have these methods. If you try `0i.max(5)`, it fails. This is counterintuitive; all numerical types should have these methods. \n\nI don't agree. It's a similar situation to other languages where there are separate functions / methods for floating point types (like `fmax` / `fmin`). The methods implement the IEEE754 `maxNum` / `minNum` operations. Integer types don't have unordered values so there would be no reason to use anything else.\n\n> Alternatively, maybe std::cmp::min/max should be used for all numerical types (they currently don't work for floating-point types).\n\nNope, they would be incorrect for floating point types. There are `partial_max` / `partial_min` functions already too.\n",

    "body": "An RFC could be filed about turning `cmp::max` / `cmp::min` into methods on an extension trait, but I don't think the specific suggestions here make sense. The reality of floating point is that it differs quite a bit from common expectations and it's not the role of the language to work around that.\n",
