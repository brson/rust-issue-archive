    "body": "+1, love this idea. How will this integrate if the developer environment? and how will dependencies be distributed along with the software? For instance, pip install everything in /usr/, or in the virtualenv if used. However, one might want its dependency project for development and only distribute the binary. How about versionning? It's a field where  I have lot of idea and some experience (in python, C++, a little bit of java), and I always wanted to do something for my C++ projects, but maybe rust is the place to do something :) I really like the simplicity of pypi, and hated the complexity of maven and generally all java-related dependency management tools.\n",

I think that the node/npm semantic versioning and dependency management (http://semver.org/, https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver) is the state-of-the-art, and I hope that Rust will consider adopting something similar.\n\nI am pretty excited about Rust, even more so than Go, because of the straightforward syntax, type inference, performance, low-level capabilities, etc.  I think that semantic versioning and dependency management similar to Node/npm would make Rust the obvious choice for many types of server-side development.\n\nBut I think that semantic versioning/dependency management is so complex that it at least deserves its own issue.\n",

Maybe under `$PWD/.rust/crates` or something. Something akin to `node_modules`. I think those systems who adopted a global install path, by default, made things much harder in the end.\n",

    "body": "I have github.com/versions, I'll push the code up soon if I have some more time to hack on it. I'm definitely a sucker for first impressions, so I'd like to get the API as nice as I can. Each \"platform\" can store arbitrary metadata per package so it should facilitate the needs of most of these different languages/systems, basically a glorified S3 with auth/signing/org/search etc.\n\nI think storing the packages in S3 would be good, we've had issues with both github and npm being down, and while S3 isn't perfect it holds up pretty well, and using a pluggable store would make it trivial for people to fork this thing and boot up a private instance. There's definitely pros and cons of centralized / decentralized, though personally I think decentralized is covered just fine already, it's easy to write a package manager that just supports tarballs/git etc, but then it's really annoying when someone's site goes down, or you're trying to find where the damn package lives and find out it it's in bitbucket or something annoying to work with haha\n",

    "body": "I think we should be careful not to over-engineer this.\n\nFor example, why store packages in S3, or separately at all? Git supports versioning (via tags), signatures, generating tarballs (git-archive), and mirroring (obviously). Find a decent Git host -- hey, don't we have GitHub? -- and we get all these features for free.\n\nIf you're a \"sucker for first impressions\", then the fact that Git does all this already should ring alarm bells. If people are tagging their versions, signing their commits, maintaining mirrors already, then why would they care if some magical package manager does it as well? What would really impress them (and me) would be if the program determined the version automatically, based on existing tags -- which is exactly what rustpkg does. Maybe even silently switch to a mirror when the main site goes down.\n\nWe want less work for ourselves, not more. If our solution ends up just a thin layer around existing tools, that's a _good thing_. Let's not forget that.\n",
