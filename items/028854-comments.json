    "body": "This and #28853 are the same issue.\n\nThe extraneous address-of operation (to `names[0]` here, `caps.at()` in #28854) causes the `Q` type parameter of `HashMap::get` to be inferred to `&'\u03b1 str`, with the argument type being `&'\u03b2 &'\u03b1 str`, and no deref-coercion taking place, and the The `T: Borrow<T>` impl is selected.\n\nAs one of the `T`-s is `&'static str`, this code compiling is suspect. The only reason this code compiles is because the type of `transforms` is a supertype of `&'a HashMap<&'c str, u32>` (where `'c` is the lifetime of the strings in `names`), which matches with `'\u03b1 = 'c`. This is, obviously, unsound, as `get` is allowed to assume that `'c: 'a` - I am not sure how bad this can be with `HashMap::get` because of parametricity, but it would _certainly_ be a hole with specialization.\n",
