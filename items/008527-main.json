  "body": "Rewriting visit.rs to operate on a borrowed `&mut V` where `<V:Visitor>`\n\nr? @nikomatsakis\nr? @pcwalton\n\nThis is the first in a planned series of incremental pull requests.  (There will probably be five pull requests including this one, though they can be combined or split as necessary.)\n\nPart of #7081.  (But definitely does _not_ complete it, not on its own, and not even after all five parts land; there are still a few loose ends to tie up or trim afterwards.)\n\nThe bulk of this change for this particular PR is pnkfelix@3d83010, which has the changes necessary to visit.rs to support everything else that comes later.  The other commits are illustrating the standard mechanical transformation that I am applying.\n\nOne important point for nearly _all_ of these pull requests: I was deliberately _not_ trying to be intelligent in the transformation. \n- My goal was to minimize code churn, and make the transformation as mechanical as possible.  \n- For example, I kept the separation between the Visitor struct (corresponding to the earlier vtable of functions that were potentially closed over local state) and the explicitly passed (and clones) visitor Env.  I am certain that this is almost always unnecessary, and a later task will be to go through an meld the Env's into the Visitors as appropriate.  (My original goal had been to make such melding part of this task; that's why I turned them into a (Env, vtable) tuple way back when.  But I digress.)\n- Also, my main goal here was to get rid of the record of `@fn`'s as described by the oldvisit.rs API.  (This series gets rid of all but one such case; I'm still investigating that.)  There is _still_ plenty of `@`-boxing left to be removed, I'm sure, and even still some `@fn`'s too; removing all of those is not the goal here; its just to get rid of the encoded protocol of `@fn`'s in the (old)visit API.\n\nTo see where things will be going in the future (i.e., to get a sneak-preview of future pull-requests in the series), see:\n- https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust/commits/fsk-visitor-vpar-defaults-step1 (that's this one)\n- https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust/commits/fsk-visitor-vpar-defaults-step2\n- https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust/commits/fsk-visitor-vpar-defaults-step3\n- https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust/commits/fsk-visitor-vpar-defaults-step4\n- https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust/commits/fsk-visitor-vpar-defaults-step5\n  - Note that between step 4 and step 5 there is just a single commit, but its a doozy because its the only case where my mechanical transformation did not apply, and thus more serious rewriting was necessary.  See commit pnkfelix@da902b2ff3b1e0bee9fc63cf00c449cceea8abf7\n",
