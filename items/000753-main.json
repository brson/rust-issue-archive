  "body": "Schedulers now each have their own lock, which reduces the contention on the big scheduler lock. This means we regularly get much better performance out of tasks.\n\nScheduler threads also wait better. Rather than using `sync::sleep`, they use `lock.wait()`, which lets them be woken up quicker when tasks become unblocked. Again, a performance improvement.\n\nTo make this not crash all the time, it was necessary to use atomic reference counts for task. Most of this will be undone later though, as we move to a handle-based system.\n",
