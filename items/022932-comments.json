Same for `panic!(\"{} {}\", 7)` Here Format! syntax will be followed, And that is why the code doesn't compile.\nNow `panic!(\"{}\")` This is a single-argument form of this macro, so it gonna to be treated as plain string. Hence it got compiled and prints `thread <main> panicked at \"{}\", ...`. \nIn case of `println!(\"{}\")` it is clearly stated in API docs that, println uses Format! syntax irrespective weather it is a multi-argument or not.\n",

    "body": "It'd be nice if we could remove the inconsistency between single-argument and multiple-argument `panic!` macros.  It's easy if we make single-argument `panic!` call `core::panicking::panic_fmt`, but that would add massive bloat to the `panic!` call sites.\n\nThis same issue came up in #22335, which tried to optimize `write*!` and `print*!` in the same way that `panic!` is already optimized.  After stumbling onto the inconsistency, the author added a `format_arg!` that evaluates to a `&'static str`.  As a new macro, it needed an RFC.\n\nI'm interested in this stuff right now because I'm working on a bootloader, and the overhead of the panic formatting code is giving me trouble -- http://users.rust-lang.org/t/fixed-overhead-rust-bootloader-and-core-panicking/429/10.\n",

    "body": "If we make single-argument `panic!` use the formatting system like `write!`, then we need an alternate syntax for the current single-argument `panic!` in libstd, so we can still do things like:\n\n``` rust\npanic!({ let x = \"{}\"; x })\npanic!(7)\n```\n\nMaybe add a `panic_arg!` or `panic_any!` macro?\n\nThe other thing needed for this issue is some way to convert a format string to an output string:\n- A new `format_arg!` macro.  (I suggest `format_args_literal!` as an alternate name.)\n- Use `format_args!` and a new method on `Arguments` to extract the lone string piece.  It will probably generate larger code then the previous option, but not worse than the current libstd `panic!`.  We'd like to place the string piece in a static item, like `core::panicking::panic` does, but we can't have a function call in a static.  This approach would generate a lot more code at each call-site, but it ought to be optimized out.\n\nI [benchmarked](https://gist.github.com/rprichard/f0528270cd2f65ded875) the size overhead of calling `panic!` with a single-argument on x86_64.  It's 52 bytes in libcore and 67 bytes in libstd.  Calling `core::panicking::panic_fmt` takes 110 bytes.\n",

E.g. any non string-literal unary input to `panic!` would continue to be accepted.\n",
