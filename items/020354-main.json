  "body": "This commit performs a second pass over the `std::thread_local` module. Most of\nthe functionality remains explicitly unstable, but the specific actions taken\nwere:\n- `thread_local` is now stable\n- `thread_local!` is now stable\n- `thread_local::Key` is now stable\n- `thread_local::Key::with` is now stable\n- `thread_local::Key::destroyed` is deprecated in favor of a more general\n  `state` function\n- `thread_local::Key::state` was added to query the three states that a key can\n  be in: uninitialized, valid, or destroyed. This function, and the\n  corresponding `State` enum, are both marked unstable as we may wish to expand\n  it later on.\n- `thread_local::scoped` is entirely unstable. There hasn't been a whole lot of\n  usage of this module in the standard distribution, so it remains unstable at\n  this time.\n\nNote that while the structure `Key` is marked stable, it is currently forced to\nexpose all of its implementation details due to the use of\nconstruction-via-macro. The use of construction-via-macro is currently required\nin order to place the `#[thread_local]` attribute on static in a\nplatform-specific manner. These stability attributes were assigned assuming that\nit will be acceptable to tweak the implementation of `Key` in the future.\n",
