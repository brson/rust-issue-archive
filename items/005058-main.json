  "body": "I've moved all intrinsics in a single file (libcore/private/intrinsics.rs) and changed a few files to make use of this file (e.g. vec.rs: move_val_init).\n\nTwo intrinsics have been commented out:\nvisit_tydesc: it uses TyDesc and TyVisitor, this would create a dependency on librustc which seems undesirable.\nframe_address: I really had no idea what it should look like without the legacy modes (would it even work? In several places in libcore the (legacy-modes) intrinsics were wrapped\nwith a normal fn) and what it was supposed to do.\n\nSome documentation is still required, but many names are fairly self-explanatory.\n",
