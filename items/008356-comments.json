    "body": "This is a great start, and I'm happy it was so easy to implement.\n\nMost of my comments are minor:\n- There are some whitespace errors with extra spaces at the end of blank lines. These won't pass tidy.\n- The benchmarks should be modified to work with `#[bench]`\n- Please use a XorShift random number generator from `std::rand`. These are fast and still have a very random distribution.\n\nFinally, the way that the vectors of work queues are managed here doesn't allow more schedulers that participate in work stealing to be added dynamically. This isn't important now, but I believe it will be necessary in the future. We don't necessarily need to fix this, but should have a plan for it.\n",
