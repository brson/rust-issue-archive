It appears to me that instead, the author expected to be able to construct a sparse vector. Although I don't know what they believed would happen if the same index were inserted twice.\n\nIn other words, I think this is a unnecessary attempt at clarifying the docs. It doesn't actually address the real confusion. Also, a single instance of confusion does not necessarily mean docs need changing anyway; even the clearest of documentation can still result in the occasional confused reader.\n",

The closest name to that is `with_capacity`, so it\u2019d be reasonable for someone to try that. It doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s no function with `length` in the name either.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to say that the above situation happens for every person looking for a function. If someone was looking for a function to create a vector from a given element, for example, they\u2019d be quite pleased to find the right function for the job, `from_elem`. But for those people who expect to be able to find a function to generate a vector with a given length, with some kind of default value, it does help to steer them away from the wrong function and give them a point in the right direction.\n",
