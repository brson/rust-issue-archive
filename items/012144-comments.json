    "body": "@brson My memory is that they are useful for two things:\n\n1) You have the freedom to change your warning & error messages. The two big scenarios where the numbers get used are in the source code entries that disable warnings for an individual block and when people write tools that scrape the output of the compiler (either for strange build systems or for custom IDE tools).\n\n2) They're dramatically easier for users to get help on, particularly when you localize the error message strings to different languages (which I don't know if we're planning to do for Rust). Then, somebody who gets the Japanese error text can still search for the error number in the documentation or on stackoverflow and find a useful entry, where searching for the text would probably miss for any language other than English.\n\nI'll ask around with some former colleagues if there were any other tradeoffs (since the practice long predated me).\n",

    "body": "For comparison, PyLint uses the letter-number scheme also and letters refer to _categories_. F for fatal, E for error, W for warning, R for refactor, C for convention.\n\nI believe that some other languages and surrounding tools operate in this way also; beyond that I know that Vim's error formatting expects one letter to indicate the category (E for error, W for warning), but it's common for that to be handled in the 'errorformat' with items like `%trror` and %tarning` for \"error\" and \"warning\"; given that we have the words \"error\", \"warning\" and \"note\", I don't think we need concern ourselves in that way\u2014I merely mention it as a data point for consideration.\n\nAs a counter-example, [C\u266f uses CS0000\u2013CS9999](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228296.aspx) for both errors and warnings; I do not know whether there is logic in the assignation of numbers therein. Still, using the common prefix CS will make searching for the errors slightly easier.\n\nI like the significant-letters scheme demonstrated in PyLint. Granted, the `rustc`/`syntax::ext`/`syntax` split is already a fair way along in that direction, but I'd prefer to see it more clear, especially with obvious letters like W for warning and E for error and L for lint. I can see something like number series allocation occurring, e.g. numbers starting with 1 being `syntax` (e.g. `E1001`, `W1001`), 2 being `syntax::ext` (e.g. `E2001`, `W2001`), and 3 being rustc. Certainly spending time figuring out nice series that should work in the longer term is a good plan; a second digit could be allocated to specific areas, such as having numbers starting with `31` being lifetime-related things in rustc.\n\n---\n\nThinking along these lines, it'd be kinda nice if we could produce some form of error hash for ICEs. The Python exception handling/reporting library Mongoose produces [Mongoose Incident Identifiers](http://themongoose.sourceforge.net) which are just this. Of course, by the time we get to 1.0 we don't _want_ to have any ICEs occurring, and the failure message is typically good enough for the rarity with which we desire these to occur. Still, it's a nice idea. But certainly out of scope for this issue.\n",

Almost everything that could be a warning (i.e. triggering on code that's not incorrect/nonsensical) is a lint.\n\nAs @alexcrichton suggests, something like `T` for typeck error, `B` for borrowck errors, `R` for resolution/privacy, `P` for parse, `M` (\"macros\") or `E` for `syntax::ext` seems more sensible.\n",

    "body": "Localizing compiler output makes sense if you are targeting certain markets (e.g., enterprise Japan) where they have sufficient monetary resources and, in practice, not only do third party libraries localize their documentation for them, but that market also has completely separate local library vendors that don't localize to English. But existence != necessity, and Rust should go the right way for its intended audience.\n\nCertainly, I agree that it's nice to prefer errors to warnings. But with a systems language, if you don't have warnings then you just end up calling a bunch of things \"diagnostics\" or \"lints\" or \"static analyses\" as soon as you want to check things that are beyond your type system but are either undecidable or computationally expensive, such as integer overflow analysis or a possibly redundant `clone` call or whatever else we'll have in Rust. And now you've reinvented warnings, but they're either a separate tool or some separate set of flags that users think are unimportant, like \"that valgrind thing.\"\n\nAll that said, I do agree with @bill-myers that having the `--explain` flag in the compiler is probably a bad idea. At the very least, we'd like to be able to make the explanations better asynchronous with users updating their version of rustc, and a wiki that explains the errors seems better for that. And improving the error text does not require going through the bors queue!\n",

    "body": "@bill-myers I emphatically object to your claim that web search engines make error codes have less value.  (I am quoting that claim here: \"Before web search engines, documented error codes were useful, but nowadays you can just paste the fixed part of the error string into Google and usually find a bug report or stackoverflow post, which makes both error codes and documentation of much less value.\")\n\nFrom my point of view, web search engines are a _reason_ to put in stable error codes; such codes _enable_ stable searches for error in question, while allowing the compiler developers to be free to change the error message output (e.g. to improve presentation/phrasing).\n\n(It also enables a common hook for conversations regarding that error to use.)\n\nWithout the codes in place, I do not doubt that people will follow exactly the protocol that you describe for finding answers to your questions, but I think providing error codes will only enrich that protocol, not detract from it.\n",
