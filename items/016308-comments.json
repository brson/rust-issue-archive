At least do something like `Merge branch SimonSapin/patch-8 into rollup` (although that particular example isn't a great branch name).\n\n~~I'm also curious as to why only the latter commits are merges. Did you switch to the merge strategy midway through constructing this PR?~~ I think that's just a GitHub display issue, ugh.\n",
