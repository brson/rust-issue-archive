    "body": "Most of them have to do with unsafe blocks, and the reason is that the unsafe checker was changed.\n\nIn stage0, this is invalid code:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::libc;\n\nfn callback(_: ~fn()) {}\n\nunsafe fn foo() {\n  do callback {\n    libc::exit(1);\n  }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n}\n```\n\nWhereas it's valid in stage1. I'm not sure if this is an unintended bug from when the unsafe checker changed, but in stage0 the owned function is required to explicitly have another unsafe block, whereas in stage1 the top-level unsafe satisfies the un-safeness requirement.\n\nThis means that to prevent errors in stage1 and so that code compiles in stage0, there have to be two versions.\n",
