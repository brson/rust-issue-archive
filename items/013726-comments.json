    "body": "I'm curious if we could take a leaf out of LLVM's book, and use the same test, but with different directives for the test. It seems like we'd only one set of test cases, and optimally have GDB and LLDB test the same set of cases (with opt outs for when one is broken).\n\nSomething along the lines of:\n\n```\n// gdb-debugger: <some gdb comand>\n// gdb-check: <check some gdb output>\n// lldb-debugger: <some lldb comand>\n// lldb-check: <check some lldb output>\n\nfn common_test_case() {\n}\n```\n\nWould that work out?

    "body": "I agree, it would be better to have just one shared test file for both debuggers. I actually started out implementing it that way but gave up on the idea a day into it, when I discovered that I had already modified way too many parts of the `compiletest` tool and saw that I would have had to modify even more if I continued following my design. However, that was nearly two months ago and in the meantime the testing methods for LLDB are not in flux anymore and I have a better grasp on the build system. I think that it shouldn't actually be too hard to have a single set of test files for both GDB and LLDB, much like the run-pass test files are re-used for the pretty printing tests.\n\nThe new plan would be to have one `src/test/debuginfo` directory but two separate `compiletest` modes. Debugger command parsing is then relegated to the `run_{GDB|LLDB}_test()` functions. It's not the prettiest approach, but trying to refactor `compiletest`'s monolithic design into something more modular was what was causing most of the trouble the first time around.\n\nI'll sketch the new solution next week. If I'm not missing something here, it should be a matter of about a day to implement it and port the tests.\n",
