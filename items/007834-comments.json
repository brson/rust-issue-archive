    "body": "If `size_of` were always invoked as calling the compiler intrinsic directly, it might be fairly simple to evaluate things like compiler intrinsics at compile-time. It's behind the `sys::size_of` function, however, which the compiler knows nothing about. Basically I think that if we get `size_of` (unless we do something like `pub use intrinsics::size_of` in `sys`), we get generic CTFE (maybe a separate issue?)\n",
