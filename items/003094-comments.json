It would consist of some number of independent tasks, only communicating with each other over pipes.  You'd want to launch all the tasks together at the start, and have all the pipes be open the whole time, so that a `try_send` couldn't fail due to a pipe being closed.  `try_recv` is already blocking, which matches the semantics of KPNs.  importantly, each task could only be waiting on one `try_recv` at a time.
