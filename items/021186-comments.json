The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @eddyb (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Just to put my answers in (biased as they may be):\n- The majority of `extern fn`s are intended for use with a non-Rust program, normally C, that will not understand unwinding. There is no sane way for a program to unwind across those boundaries.\n- I would like a way to print a better message, but as I mentioned before, we already need a general-purpose way to just print out a message in these cases. Notably OOM just aborts without a message too.\n- See the first point, it's going to be pretty rare that you _want_ unwinding across these boundaries. Note that I only realised we needed it because I broke the unwinding code. To put this another way, the only time we expect there to be unwinding out of an `extern fn` is when that function is part of the unwinding machinery itself.\n",

    "body": "Ok, we chatted about this today in the weekly meeting and here's an update. First off, thanks again for the PR! We're all pretty excited to take advantage of the optimizations LLVM provides. For now, however, we're thinking we may want step back and make an RFC for this PR before landing.\n\nThe primary change we're worried about is the difference in unwinding semantics when unwinding past an extern fn and we think that there may be some design space to explore before committing to one strategy. We had some fleeting ideas such as using a similar strategy for unwinding in destructors perhaps. Regardless, we're a little unsure that these are the semantics we'd want to commit to, so we'd just want to canvas some more feedback before moving forward in this respect.\n\nI'd be more than willing to help out in writing up, proofing, or otherwise just reviewing an RFC for this area. Feel free to ping me on IRC about this whenever!\n\nTo move forward this this specific PR I think we can take a slightly altered strategy as well. In the past we've accepted implementation details which improved the efficiency of standard library primitives (e.g. NonZero) before we were ready to commit to a public API (it's entirely an implementation detail). Along these lines I think that at bare minimum the attributes this PR adds can be accepted pretty quickly (due to being behind a feature gate). I think we may also be able to take advantage of flagging FFI declarations (extern { ... } blocks) as nounwind for LLVM itself, due to unwinding being undefined behavior in that scenario today.\n\nDoes that make sense for moving forward? Again, thanks for the work in this area, it's definitely much appreciated!\n",
