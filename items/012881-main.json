  "body": "I often use [tup](http://gittup.org/tup/) / [ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/) as build systems which pipe input into an internal buffer and only later send it to `stdout`,\n\nRustc disables coloring when it's piped into any other source. Hence, I lose all coloring when using rust with tup.\n\nClang has the same behaviour by default, _but_ provides a compiler flag `-f-color-diagnostics` which forces colored output to be emitted. This would be really useful to have in rustc. It makes debugging and in general compiling far more pleasant.\n\nThanks!\n",
