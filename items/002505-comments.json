I was more concerned with the documented discoverability of functions that were written with the for loop protocol in mind. For example, someone coming from another language might expect `int::range(0, n)` to return an array of integers, without having any clue why it takes a function as an argument, or why it behaves not at all as they expect. This is the exact opposite of what you were worried about: functions intended-to-be-used-with-a-for-loop-but-not. :)\n",
