The interior of this \"fat pointer\" is not described any further yet. What is missing is the description of the trait's methods. I don't know enough about how they are actually implemented to say much about that.\n",

    "body": "We could do the following:\n(1) Create a type descriptions for each trait that contains the methods it defines. Since there are no traits in the DWARF standard yet, using `DW_AT_interface` would make the most sense. But maybe using `DW_AT_struct` is more compatible with our C-oriented debuggers.  \n\n(2) Describe trait pointers (`&Trait` et al) as tuples of type `(*(), *OpaqueVTable<Trait>)`. \n\n(3) Implement custom GDB/LLDB commands in Python that, given a fat pointer, use the pointer value and type information to print the vtable.\n\nThat's not perfect but could be done with the current means available. The symbol names of the functions pointed to by the vtable should also indicate the actual runtime type of the trait object.\n",

    "body": "I looked into this a bit recently.  What I hope to do is:\r\n\r\n* Emit some DWARF describing each vtable that is emitted.  This would describe the vtable's type (as a struct of pointers-to-function), the vtable's location, and the concrete type represented by that vtable (maybe `DW_AT_containing_type` can be repurposed for this).\r\n* Further describe the interior of a trait object pointer.  Currently I think this has to be done via a bit of a hack, because while DWARF describes a way to compute a given function's vtable slot, it doesn't seem to have a way to indicate \"this member of the object is the vtable\". \r\n\r\nThen a debugger can do the following to print a trait object pointer: if a value's type has a vtable, fetch the vtable from the inferior, look up the vtable's address in the DWARF to find the vtable type, and then use the concrete type to decode the payload pointer.\r\n",
