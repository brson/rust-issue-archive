    "body": "I agree that it's unfortunate, and that it probably shouldn't be the final fix.\n\nThe error is in node_id_to_type, but it's not quite as straightforward as adding a missing map insert during typechecking.  The root of the problem is that during typechecking the compiler sometimes wants to call eval_const_expr_partial, and when that sometimes is a cast expr, and the cast expr itself hasn't yet been typechecked, it blows up.  So in #5900, for instance, defining the enum before the mod worked b/c the enum gets typechecked first.  \n\nI describe an alternate fix at https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/5900#issuecomment-28990153 that does work by adding to the map, but I went w/ this PR's approach because it's more in the direction of one possible 'real' fix, making const exprs more safely evaluable at any time.\n",

The new limited type lookup function in astconv no longer duplicates knowledge of what makes a const, it just looks for primitives and eval_const_expr_partial keeps the knowledge of what makes for a legal const.  I also refactored ast_ty_to_ty to use that helper function instead of duplicating it.  \n\nAlso added a test for 9942.\n",
