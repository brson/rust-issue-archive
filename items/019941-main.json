  "body": "This commit adds support for the compiler to distinguish between different forms\nof lookup paths in the compiler itself. Issue #19767 has some background on this\ntopic, as well as some sample bugs which can occur if these lookup paths are not\nseparated.\n\nThis commits extends the existing command line flag `-L` with the same trailing\nsyntax as the `-l` flag. Each argument to `-L` can now have a trailing `:all`,\n`:native`, `:crate`, or `:dependency`. This suffix indicates what form of lookup\npath the compiler should add the argument to. The `dependency` lookup path is\nused when looking up crate dependencies, the `crate` lookup path is used when\nlooking for immediate dependencies (`extern crate` statements), and the `native`\nlookup path is used for probing for native libraries to insert into rlibs. Paths\nwith `all` are used for all of these purposes (the default).\n\nThe default compiler lookup path (the rustlib libdir) is by default added to all\nof these paths. Additionally, the `RUST_PATH` lookup path is added to all of\nthese paths.\n\nCloses #19767\n",
