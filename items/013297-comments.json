    "body": "There is a broader problem here: the `Float` trait defines several methods for various constants that almost follow those in the standard `float.h`, but:\n\n`Float::epsilon` says \n\n> Returns the smallest positive number that this type can represent \n\nwhile `FLT_EPSILON` for `float.h` says \n\n> Minimum int x such that FLT_RADIX**(x-1) is a normalised float\n\n(In particular, `Float::epsilon` matches `FLT_MIN` in `float.h`)\n\nMoreover, `Float::digits` says\n\n> Returns the number of binary digits of exponent that this type supports.\n\nwhile `FLT_DIG` for `float.h` says \n\n> This is the number of decimal digits of precision for the float data type. Technically, if p and b are the precision and base (respectively) for the representation, then the decimal precision q is the maximum number of decimal digits such that any floating point number with q base 10 digits can be rounded to a floating point number with p base b digits and back again, without change to the q decimal digits. \n\nFinally, the float types implement the `Bounded` trait, but provide the minimum positive value for `Bounded::min_val`.  I'm guessing this should be the smallest number above negative infinity.  But the `Bounded` trait does not give specs for `min_val`.\n\nDoes anyone know if these discrepancies, which affect both `f32` and `f64`, are intended?  My instinct would be to match `float.h`, and to fix the original bug by having each of `f32` and `f64` only supply the constants once (they are currently duplicated).\n\n@bjz, care to weigh in?\n",
