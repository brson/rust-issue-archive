    "body": "Rust doesn't actually expect a semicolon after a struct/enum definition (unlike C). If you use one at the top-level, you'll get an error like this:\n\n```\nfoo.rs:1:30: 1:31 error: expected item but found `;`\nfoo.rs:1  struct Point {x: int, y: int};\n```\n\nInside functions, redundant semicolons are allowed _right now_ so either will work. However, I don't think they will always be allowed.\n",
