    "body": "Fully agree. Among the things it should cover:\n- What a docstring is\n- First paragraph is summary\n- Summary should usually be a single sentence, and should always have a trailing period\n  - At least for functions. Our modules almost never have the trailing period. That seems ok to me, but it's all subjective\n- Tense, e.g. \"Create a Foo\" vs \"Creates a Foo\"\n  - Tense in summary different than tense in rest of documentation? It sometimes is. Is that ok?\n- Proper use of inline code spans whenever referencing e.g. types, variables\n- Proper use of code blocks (<code>```</code>, not <code>~~~~</code>)\n- Code block modifiers, e.g. `rust`, `ignore`, `notrust`\n- Common headers seen in docstrings, e.g. `# Example`, `# Failure`\n",
