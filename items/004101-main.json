  "body": "r? @pcwalton\n\nThis makes test cases like the following work:\n\n```\ntrait A {\n    fn g() -> int { 10 }\n}\n\nimpl int: A { }\n\nfn f<T: A>(i: T) {\n    assert i.g() == 10;\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    f(0);\n}\n```\n\nWhat doesn't work is if trait A is itself parameterized. This commit includes such testcases, xfailed. As with each of my commits to traits, the hacks involved make me feel uncomfortable. Trans isn't told specifically that it's implementing a default method - instead method lookup on the impl fails so trans decides that must be what's going on then starts grovelling for default implementations.\n",
