    "body": "Visiting for triage from 2013-07-22 email.\n\nOne can readily reproduce this (and toggle between working/non-working) by running `mingw-get upgrade \"libstdc++>=4.7\"` in a MinGW window.  (I do not personally know where things will fail if you upgrade your gcc to 4.7 or beyond; upgrading it did not immediately fail for me, but I did not test it thoroughly.)\n\n(It is also not too hard to have two distinct installation of MinGW, and then toggle between then by modifying your `PATH` accordingly so that the dll lookup proceeds in whichever MinGW installation you wish to test.  For example, I am playing with a wrapper `.bat` file that is just the following\n\n```\nrem PATH=c:\\MinGWissue5712\\bin;c:\\Rust\\bin\\;c:\\Python27;%PATH%\nPATH=c:\\MinGW\\bin;c:\\Rust\\bin\\;c:\\Python27;%PATH%\nstart\n```\n\nwhich opens a command window with the `PATH` set to look up the corresponding dll's.)\n\nI do not yet know if we should/must fail the installation outright if the user has not yet installed the appropriate `libstdc++-6.dll` variant.  It might be better if we can detect the situation from `rust.exe` and instruct the user as to how to fix the problem at runtime, especially since someone might inadvertently upgrade their MinGW libraries after having installed Rust, and at that point an install-time check will be of no use.\n",
