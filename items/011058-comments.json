Most of the ugliness here is a workaround for the fact that we don't extend temporary lifetimes to an entire chain of method calls, which is something Niko is working on right now. So I think the temporary problems, are, well, temporary.\n",

    "body": "I agree, this is some seriously nasty code with this change. I agree that changing the lifetime of temporaries will improve this immensely, but this is also gonna need some pointer trait enhancements. There's really no question between:\n\n``` rust\nfoo.bar.insert(k, v);\nfoo.bar.borrow_mut().get().insert(k, v);\n```\n\nI don't think we'll ever get back to where we once were, but I would be content with\n\n``` rust\nfoo.bar.borrow_mut().insert(k, v);\n```\n\nWhich I believe is the direction that we're headed in (smart pointer somehow on the RAII thing returned by `borrow_mut`. Overall though, you are amazing for doing all this!\n",
