Also specialized is_upper/lowercase in the same way.\n\nFor my personal usecase (using str.words() on a ~15M ascii file), it went from ~18% in tables::White_Space to ~7% in u_char::is_whitespace which is a clear win.\n\nThe generated assembly is just ~20 instructions, so it should be fine. But I\u2019m by far no pro when it comes to reading assembly :-D\n",
