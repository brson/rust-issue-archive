    "body": "This I think needs some sort of dependency-graph-style abstraction for knowing when a function can _never_ be called from an outside crate. Functions which can be called from outside crates are:\n- All functions located in `exported_items`\n- All non-generic functions called by some chain of generic functions rooted in an exported generic function.\n\nAlthough that's probably not a complete list, I think to do this we need a hash of function id to a list of functions that could possibly be called, and then crawling can commence from there.\n\nI'm also not sure if we're marking all instantiations of generic functions as internal, but we certainly can...\n\n@huonw, that looks like an LLVM problem, and it still wouldn't matter too much because you can't cal `foo` by its name from an external crate, only by indexing into the `FUNCS` array which will just be pointers anyway.\n",
