  "body": "This patch does not make many functional changes, but does a lot of restructuring towards the goals of #5527. This is the biggest patch, basically, that should enable most of the other patches in a relatively straightforward way.\n\nMajor changes:\n- Do not track impls through trans, instead recompute as needed.\n- Isolate trait matching code into its own module, carefully structure to distinguish various phases (selection vs confirmation vs fulfillment)\n- Consider where clauses in their more general form\n- Integrate checking of builtin bounds into the  trait matching process, rather than doing it separately in kind.rs (important for opt-in builtin bounds)\n\nWhat is not included:\n- Where clauses are still not generalized. This should be a straightforward follow-up patch.\n- Caching. I did not include much caching. I have plans for various kinds of caching we can do. Should be straightforward. Preliminary perf measurements suggested that this branch keeps compilation times roughly what they are.\n- Method resolution. The initial algorithm I proposed for #5527 does not work as well as I hoped. I have a revised plan which is much more similar to what we do today.\n- Deref vs deref-mut. The initial fix I had worked great for autoderef, but not for explicit deref. \n- Permitting blanket impls to overlap with specific impls. Initial plan to consider all nested obligations before considering an impl to match caused many compilation errors. We have a revised plan but it is not implemented here, should be a relatively straightforward extension.\n",
