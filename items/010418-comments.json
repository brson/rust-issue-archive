    "body": "One thought I had in an e-mail conversation with @martindemello was that it might be useful to make a trait for working with enums which allows conversion not from the _discriminant_ of an enum but rather from its index in the list of variants (which is usually, but not always, equal to the discriminant). This would allow us to guarantee for example that we can compact use bits from `0...n-1` to represent the values of an enum, and it would make it easier to define things like `count()` (total number of variants) and so forth. This might or might not be `RangeEnum`.\n",

    "body": "Java defines the `ordinal()` method on enums to return the index of a variant. I find it dangerous as code using it is extremely fragile to modifications of the enum. It may be less dangerous here if it has to be manually specified to be derived, as that can serve as documentation that you need to be careful when modifying the enum. People might miss it if it's buried inside of `Eq, Decodable, Encodable, Ord, ...` though.\n",
