    "body": "The problem appears to be the definition of `Node` in `parser.rs`:\n\n```\npub struct Node {\n    token: Token,\n    left: Option<Node>,\n    right: Option<Node>,\n    index: uint\n}\n```\n\nThat makes for an infinite size struct because every `Node` contains another two `Node`s inside the `Option` enums there. The standard solution is to use `Option<~Node>` or similar, so that the size of those fields is fixed by the pointer size rather than recursive. Of course, the issue here is that rustc doesn't catch that which frankly surprises me given that this is pretty much our go-to example for motivating `~` boxes now. ;)\n\n(ps: sorry for the prematurely submitted comment, my fingers slipped)\n",
