    "body": "> Yes, built-in operations override the overloaded ones (and I have checked).\n\nGreat, I asked because I read that you haven't tried compiling yet, but that probably was too long ago.\n\n> and this diagnostic is certainly a bug (not one that needs to be addressed here). Either way, even if it worked, I don't know of any safe thing one can do with a &mut str other than convert to a &str.\n\nSure, just curious if this opens the door to creating `&mut str` and I am wondering if we want to allow that, since that type is not useful, although it's probably harmless as well. BTW, if you change `let s: &mut str = &mut *s` to `let s: &mut str = s.deref_mut()` does that compile?.\n",
