Of course at the moment the library just hard codes all 'float' operations to casted `f64`s, but that's an separate issue.\n\nThe reason it's a separate type and not a typedef is the same as for `(u)int`s: Code would break on other platforms if you rely on it being the same type with just another name.\n",

    "body": "So why are we using `f64` for `float` on x86/x86_64? The legacy x87 floating point support is _neither_ 32-bit or 64-bit - they're emulated on top of 80-bit registers. SSE supports both floats and doubles natively - there's no reason a double would be faster since it uses 2x the cache space and SSE operations can do 4 floats at a time but only 2 doubles.\n\nIs there really an architecture where a double is faster?\n",

But I think removing `float` makes just as much sense as trying to nail down a predictable behavior for it.\n\nOnce removed, the question then becomes what type `1.0` acquires if it's not otherwise constrained. The three options are: `f32`, `f64`, or throwing an error. The latter makes sense if you want to leave open the door for arbitrary-precision floating point as the default later, although I believe that would be too much of a hidden performance hit to ever do. My vote is for defaulting to `f64`.\n",
