    "body": "There are two issues being solved here: 1 is expressing dependencies between test crates, 2 is running arbitrary commands to test various properties.\n\nLet's avoid adding a feature that instructs the test runner to execute arbitrary commands, because it's too open-ended and could make things harder to maintain later.\n\nIn your example above where you want to test that rustc names the output correctly, I would suggest that the best way to do this would be to write unit tests in rustc itself. That would verify that the functions that are responsible for naming output produce the correct result. It's true that it wouldn't strictly test that the actual file showed up as expected, but you can still get a lot of guarantees out of fine-grained unit tests.\n\nFrankly, I'm not crazy about having the test runner create a workspace for every test and split them up like that. Not sure why, but it seems like too many moving parts.\n\nFor expressing dependencies between crates we could do something like the following:\n\n1) We create a way to use rustc to query the attributes of source code.\n2) We convert all the current comment-directives to attributes.\n3) We add a #[test_dep] attribute that specifies the name of a different test, which compiletest then uses to establish a build order.\n4) The existing #[crate_type] attribute would direct rustc to build the dependencies as libraries.\n\nThis replaces our little but growing comment-language with an existing mechanism.\n\nI'm still not sure this is a good idea either for a few reasons:\n\n1) The crates which are dependencies would then need to be marked in such a way that compiletest knows they aren't themselves tests. This is potentially fine, since we've had other cases like this - there's at least one file that is marked xfail just so compiletest doesn't run it.\n2) We then have attributes in most every test. This could interfere with tests that are actually trying to test attributes\n3) Attributes depend on the parser, so compile-fail tests that test parser failure would make it difficult to read the attributes.\n\nAfter writing all those negatives I am less fond of this idea.\n",

    "body": "I agree with the comment of running arbitrary commands. I prefer testing the functionality as unit tests.\n\nMake a temporary work space for each test creates a \"namespace\" for crate libraries. So we can have lots of libfoo without wasting time finding new name or solving name collisions. A work space can also be created by putting many source files in one folder, then we need to invent another format for specifying the build order. Writing them all down in one file implies the build order. And it's easier to read when all code are in one file, presumably they are all short enough.\n\nI actually like the \"comment directives\", it has limitations but it's also more intuitive and self-contained. The compiler is just a hundred lines of code? Attributes may be well used for unit tests, but I feel comment directive serves better when testing the compiler as a black box.\n\nI am thinking this all as one single test. Building a dependent relationship makes things more complex, and maybe unnecessary.\n",

This will cause rustc to be invoked on the given target with the given options.\n- There will be a sibling directory of run-pass, compile-fail, etc called \"aux\".  When you want to write a test that uses multiple modules, you put the main module in run-pass etc as usual, and the other module(s) in aux.  The other module(s) must be buildable.\n- The main module can then do `//build --lib aux/foo` and `use foo;` as normal.  The test runner will add `-L aux` to the command-line automatically.\n",
