    "body": "A change to the language like this should be proposed through the [RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).\n\nIt's intended to be the remainder operator because it maps to the functionality of hardware, just like in C. It maps directly to the `urem` and `srem` instructions in LLVM, and those have direct equivalents on the CPU. The corresponding trait is `ops::Rem` and the method is called `rem`, so there's a full awareness of the operator's semantics. The division operator is also explicitly defined as a _truncating_ integer division like C, not one taking the floor like Python.\n\n>  but it doesn't give the middle finger to mathematicians either.\n\nIt's not like `%` is the modulo operator in mathematical notation. AFAIK it's an ALGOL/C-ism and Rust is consistent with the origin of the operator. Mathematica and Matlab don't use the `%` operator for this either.\n",
