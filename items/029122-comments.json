    "body": "It looks like this comes from the linker producing output (normal or error) that is not valid UTF-8.  Fixing this in any other way than just using a lossy conversion is going to be really painful because it goes through the error logging infrastructure, which all works with `str`s.  That's certainly not ideal, because it would be best to relay other programs' messages to the user unchanged, but it's probably the only realistic way to handle this in the near future.\n",

I'm not sure why else the message would be non-UTF-8.  (I can't reproduce the ICE on that crate (I just get a normal link error), but I can reproduce the ICE by constructing a situation where the linker prints non-UTF-8 messages.)\n\nBut yeah, some kind of lossy conversion with hex escapes is probably the way to go.
