    "body": "See the dialogue starting here in particular: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/4499#issuecomment-36292097\n\nEssentially, it is a huge abuse of the system to transmute a value to an instance of an empty enum.  Arguably we should assign a size to an empty enum that would ensure such transmutation does not occur.  (in the past I have considered e.g. changing our internal size representation for types to be an `Option<usize>` instead of always assuming that all types have a size...)\n\nI am actually halfway tempted to assign them the size `usize::MAX` right now.  I bet that would essentially fix all attempts to expose these bugs.  :)\n",
