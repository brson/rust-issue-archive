    "body": "Notes from talking to @aturon \n\nborrow is used in things like hashmap, where you have a key, and the map needs to store the owned version, but you want to look things up by the borrowed version. `HashMap<String, i32>`, but you want to look up by string literals: `&str`.\n\nfor most types, you want T and &T. but for things that take slices, there's a few different slice types. Borrow is good for this\n\nit's more restrictive than asref, because the assumption is the borrow is the same wrt hashing or comparison: String, &str, and &String all hash to the same value.\n\nAsRef: you can get a different reference out of this. that's it. a conversion, not an equivalence.\n\nanything htat impls borrow should implement asref, but no blanket because of coherence\n",
