  "body": "This commit performs a stabilization pass over the `std::fs` module now that\nit's had some time to bake. The change was largely just adding `#[stable]` tags,\nbut there are a few APIs that remain `#[unstable]`.\n\nThe following apis are now marked `#[stable]`:\n- `std::fs` (the name)\n- `File`\n- `Metadata`\n- `ReadDir`\n- `DirEntry`\n- `OpenOptions`\n- `Permissions`\n- `File::{open, create}`\n- `File::{sync_all, sync_data}`\n- `File::set_len`\n- `File::metadata`\n- Trait implementations for `File` and `&File`\n- `OpenOptions::new`\n- `OpenOptions::{read, write, append, truncate, create}`\n- `OpenOptions::open` - this function was modified, however, to not attempt to\n  reject cross-platform openings of directories. This means that some platforms\n  will succeed in opening a directory and others will fail.\n- `Metadata::{is_dir, is_file, len, permissions}`\n- `Permissions::{readonly, set_readonly}`\n- `Iterator for ReadDir`\n- `DirEntry::path`\n- `remove_file` - like with `OpenOptions::open`, the extra windows code to\n  remove a readonly file has been removed. This means that removing a readonly\n  file will succeed on some platforms but fail on others.\n- `metadata`\n- `rename`\n- `copy`\n- `hard_link`\n- `soft_link`\n- `read_link`\n- `create_dir`\n- `create_dir_all`\n- `remove_dir`\n- `remove_dir_all`\n- `read_dir`\n\nThe following apis remain `#[unstable]`.\n- `WalkDir` and `walk` - there are many methods by which a directory walk can be\n  constructed, and it's unclear whether the current semantics are the right\n  ones. For example symlinks are not handled super well currently. This is now\n  behind a new `fs_walk` feature.\n- `File::path` - this is an extra abstraction which the standard library\n  provides on top of what the system offers and it's unclear whether we should\n  be doing so. This is now behind a new `file_path` feature.\n- `Metadata::{accessed, modified}` - we do not currently have a good\n  abstraction for a moment in time which is what these APIs should likely be\n  returning, so these remain `#[unstable]` for now. These are now behind a new\n  `fs_time` feature\n- `set_file_times` - like with `Metadata::accessed`, we do not currently have\n  the appropriate abstraction for the arguments here so this API remains\n  unstable behind the `fs_time` feature gate.\n- `PathExt` - the precise set of methods on this trait may change over time and\n  some methods may be removed. This API remains unstable behind the `path_ext`\n  feature gate.\n- `set_permissions` - we may wish to expose a more granular ability to set the\n  permissions on a file instead of just a blanket \"set all permissions\" method.\n  This function remains behind the `fs` feature.\n\nThe following apis are now `#[deprecated]`\n- The `TempDir` type is now entirely deprecated and is [located on\n  crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tempdir) as the `tempdir` crate with [its source](https://github.com/rust-lang/tempdir) at\n  rust-lang/tempdir.\n\nThe stability of some of these APIs has been questioned over the past few weeks\nin using these APIs, and it is intentional that the majority of APIs here are\nmarked `#[stable]`. The `std::fs` module has a lot of room to grow and the\nmaterial is [being tracked in a RFC issue](rust-lang/rfcs#939).\n\nCloses #22879 \n\n[breaking-change]\n",
