If `rustc` needs its own set, wouldn't it make sense to link them statically?\n\nThey're built in an earlier stage, so in theory this could break due to either bugs or stage markers. In practice, it's fine to link them and I do it in my Arch Linux package.\n\nhttps://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk?h=packages/rust\nhttps://github.com/thestinger/packages/tree/master/rust-git\n\n> 2. Why can't `rustc` figure out which one to use?\n\nOnly one of these should be in the library search path. I'm not quite sure what's going wrong, but perhaps it has to do with you adding the `rustlib` directory to the search path.\n",

The _compiler's_ runtime libraries are in `/usr/lib64`.\n2. The _target_ libraries (the ones that are linked to) are in `/usr/lib64/rustlib/$target/lib`\n\nThis means the _host_ library (the one in `/usr/lib64`) was not generated by the compiler living at `/usr/bin/rustc`, meaning the compiler doesn't link to it by default. When you pass `-L /usr/lib64`, it's found as a candidate, however.\n\nThat's the situation, and one possible solution is to assume convergence and not distribute target artifacts for the host architecture (have it all in `/usr/lib64`). I think we'd want to think a bit about doing that, however.\n",

    "body": "This issue is becoming problematic for me now, because OS X 10.10 no longer searches /usr/local/lib by default for libraries. I can no longer compile [rust-lua](https://github.com/kballard/rust-lua) because it can't find `-llua`. If I add `-L/usr/local/lib` then I get the multiple matching dylibs error. I can compile successfully with `#[link_args = \"-L/usr/local/lib -llua\"]` but unfortunately these arguments aren't propagated to downstream dependencies of my rlib, so they don't even know to link against `-llua` (much less where to find it).\n\nHow did rustc handle this issue before? Did it simply not search /usr/local/lib for crates, but the system linker would go ahead and search it when linking the final result to find third-party libs?\n\nI think rustc needs to simply prioritize dylibs found inside the target library root over anything else.\n",

    "body": "I still think the solution is to link `rustc` statically. There are no advantages of dynamic linking for `rustc`: we're not loading LLVM lazily so startup times are not improved and the libraries _must not_ be linked to by more than one executable. Also, `rustc` defaults to building `rlib`s, this is explicitly worked around in the build system up to and including a special compiler flag.\n\nMoving to a prefer-static build would likely do good things to the cross-platform story as well.\n\nFor a workaround, [FHS](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#USRLIBLIBRARIESFORPROGRAMMINGANDPA) says:\n\n> Applications may use a single subdirectory under /usr/lib. If an application uses a subdirectory, all architecture-dependent data exclusively used by the application must be placed within that subdirectory.\n",

    "body": "I think that the problem with OS X 10.10 is that there appears to be a `-syslibroot` flag passed to `ld` by default, which I believe means the default library search path will only contain paths in the SDK and not the actual `/usr/local/lib` on disk. Rust could fix this by passing `-L/usr/local/lib` to `cc`. It also seems I can say `env LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib cargo test` and it will properly find the library inside `/usr/local/lib`, but of course that's not a solution to the problem.\n",

If it's not, run\n`export LIBRARY_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib\"`\n",
