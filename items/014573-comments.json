    "body": "We're trying to keep the number of macros hard-wired into the compiler as small as possible now that we have an infrastructure for dynamically loading syntax extensions at compile time. If this is added, it should be added as a library outside of the compiler. \n\nThat being said, this use case seems similar to the use case of the fourcc and hexfloat crates, which are really crates that want to be managed by `cargo`, so this may be best waiting until `cargo` exists to be able to officially distribute it easily.\n",
