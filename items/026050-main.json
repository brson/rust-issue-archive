  "body": "The recent bug that was found in LinkedList reminded me of some general cleanup\nthat's been waiting for some time.\n- Use a loop from the front in Drop, it works just as well and without an unsafe block\n- Change Rawlink methods to use `unsafe` in an idiomatic way. This does mean that\n  we need an unsafe block for each dereference of a raw link. Even then, the extent\n  of unsafe-critical code is even larger of course, since safety depends on the whole\n  data structure's integrity. This is a general problem we are aware of.\n- Some cleanup just to try to decrease the amount of Rawlink handling.\n",
