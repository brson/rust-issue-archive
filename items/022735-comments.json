    "body": "I ~~mistakenly~~ correctly thought that `BufReader` does not automatically grow an overconsumed buffer on reading, ~~but it's backed by a `Cursor<Vec<u8>>` so it does. It's still not great to allow the internal buffer grow unchecked, but at least there is no potential for silent data loss. But if anyone implements their own buffered reader or a similar API backed by a `Cursor` over fixed-size mutable buffer, they can be hit with bogus EOFs.~~\n\nNow, I can see three alternative ways to deal with the issue:\n1. Revert to the status quo, but keep the debug assertion against overconsumption. This allows free seeking, and `fill_buf` will never panic while being slower than it would need to be had the invariant on keeping the position within bounds been in effect. In non-debug builds of libstd, overconsuming a fixed buffer may result in a bogus EOF, whereas in debug builds the same misuse will cause an informative panic. This is probably not very useful if debug-asserted libstd is going to be used rarely. We can also make the assertion unconditionally compiled, creating another performance tax on all correct usage.\n2. Make `seek` on a fixed-size buffer return an error if the requested position is past the end. This will restrict freedom for 'seek arithmetic', but the in-bounds invariant will only be broken by overconsumption in `BufRead`, which means that any misuse will result in panic regardless of the build configuration.\n3. As implemented on the current top of the branch: Clamp the position to the end of a fixed-size buffer if the seek request is past the end. This has the same benefits as 2., but is worse for sloppy 'seek arithmetics' where the client blindly unwraps the results without examining the resulting position.\n\nI'd like your opinions on which approach should this PR commit to.\n",

    "body": "@mzabaluev Thanks for this PR, and my apologies for it slipping through the cracks.\n\nAfter discussion with @alexcrichton, our feeling is that the current behavior of producing an error only when IO is attempted out of bounds is fine. In particular, our treatment for growable buffers and files matches [Posix's lseek](http://linux.die.net/man/2/lseek): we only grow the buffer at the point that writing is actually performed. The current semantics for fixed buffers aligns well with that, the subsequent error when actually attempting IO after the seek seems enough to detect programmer error here.\n\nThat said, I'm going to close this PR for the time being. Thanks again.\n",
