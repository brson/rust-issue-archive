  "body": "Includes an upstream commit by pcwalton to improve codegen of our enums getting\nmoved around.\n\nThis also introduces a new commit on top of our stack of patches to fix a mingw32 build issue. I have submitted the patch upstream: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-commits/Week-of-Mon-20140210/204653.html\n\nI verified that this builds on the try bots, which amazes me because I think that c++11 is turned on now, but I guess we're still lucky!\n\nCloses #10613 (pcwalton's patch landed)\nCloses #11992 (llvm has removed these options)\n",
