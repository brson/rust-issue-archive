    "body": "So this looks good to me. I don't have a strong opinion about the move to free fns from methods. It is true that `self.foo(...)` reads better than `foo(resolver, ...)` -- helps to focus the eye on the relevant arguments. Another possibility would be to use an extension trait on `Resolver` or, probably better, impl the methods on a newtype'd `Resolver` like `struct GraphBuilder { resolver: Resolver }`. The visitor would thus carry around a pointer to that instead of the resolver itself, and it would invoke `self.builder.foo()` rather than `foo(self.resolver, ...)`.\n",
