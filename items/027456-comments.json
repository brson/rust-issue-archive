Unsafe code is inherently uncommon; the user assumes all risks involved wheb writing unsafe code, which includes simple mistakes. \n\nThat being said, perhaps you can pitch this idea to @Manishearth for https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/, or even implement it yourself! Lints don't have to be developed in-tree to be useful. Then, if your lint turns out to be really useful, you'll have much more momentum behind you to get it pulled into rustc. \n",
