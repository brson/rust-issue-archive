  "body": "Like ruby, python, and node.js javascript, go is a commonly used modern language on the server. Like them it is garbage-collected. Unlike them, it does not have a GIL (indeed, it is even compiled to native assembly instructions).\n\nA quick [conversation](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust/2015-10-08/?msg=51453621&page=22) in the Rust IRC channel lends me to think this is at least worth considering.\n\nAs noted in the HTML comment, this submission has times measured on a different system than the other examples, mine. On mine, the other examples took 50%, 60%, or 88% of the time listed (depending on the example). The example should probably be measured on the same system as the others in any final version of this chapter.\n",
