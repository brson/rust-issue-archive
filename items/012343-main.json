  "body": "I don't think `extra` is a good/meaningful name for a library. `libextra` should disappear, and we move all of its sub modules out of it. This PR is just one of that steps: move `extra::test` to `libtest`.\n\nI didn't add `libtest` to doc index, because it's an internal library currently.\n\n**Update:**\n\nAll comments addressed. All tests passed. Rebased and squashed.\n",
