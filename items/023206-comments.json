    "body": "@alexcrichton regarding the bloat: we are talking about `println(format_args!(\u2026))` vs `stdout().write_fmt(format_args!(\u2026))` here. Sure, the latter has some additional overhead, but only a little (calling `println` which `println` calls vs overhead calling `stdout()` + `Write::write_fmt`).\n\nCurrently, as patch is now, this comes out to 17 insns (old) vs 30 insns (new) when optimised and ~50 insns (old) vs ~100 insns (new) without optimisations. Most of the additional overhead in the new version comes from multiple invocations of `format_args!`. This can easily be avoided/remedied by calling `write_fmt` directly and `concat!`ing the format string with a newline smartly (20 insns optimised and ~70 insns not optimised).\n\nRegarding other points, I\u2019m fine with holding the PR off until flushing at exit works.\n\n@hauleth I\u2019d rather see `at_exit()` working instead. This is not time critical PR and there\u2019s no need to resort to hacks yet.\n\nEDIT: err, I didn\u2019t account for all the drop glue in my instruction calculations.\n",

    "body": "> EDIT: err, I didn\u2019t account for all the drop glue in my instruction calculations.\n\nAh yeah I've found in the past that this introduces quite a bit more code to deal with the owned `Stdout` value along with the owned `io::Result<()>` value. As a measurement of 1k `println!(\"Hello {}\", \"world\")` it is 715K for me before this change and 1.2M after this change. The macro here also has a much higher compile time for the test case.\n\nBasically I do agree that the differences are pretty minor, but for a super heavily used macro like `println!` LLVM will definitely benefit from not having to inline anything as well as not having to deal with drop glue.\n",
