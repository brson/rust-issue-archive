(EDIT: #32911)\n\nI did think I would be able to work around it by pulling the crates into internal modules and just exposing functions for the benchmarks to call into, but that fails as for some reason you can only import macros in at the crate root (seems like an arbitrary restriction, if you can define private macros in a sub-module why can't you import private macros that are only needed in a sub-module to prevent polluting your global macro namespace).\n\nThe only workaround I've found is to group my benchmarks by implementing crate instead of grouping them by what they are doing, this makes changing the benchmarks more error-prone as I have to make almost identical changes to 3 different files without being able to easily see them all at once to check they're still doing the same thing.\n",

    "body": "Question: what to do when using both `#[macro_use]` and `#[macro_reexport]` on the same `extern crate` declaration?\n\nLet's say you have a renaming item `foo=\"bar\"`. Should this apply to, say, `#[macro_reexport(bar)]`? Would the macro be exported as `foo` instead? Or should we instead refer to the macro by its local name when reexporting it, as in `#[macro_reexport(foo)]`? Also, it could be great to be able to provide a different renaming for exporting than for importing, so to be able to say `#[macro_reexport(foo=\"bar\")]`, wether the reexported macros are selected with their original or with their local name.\n",
