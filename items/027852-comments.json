    "body": "The hard part about writing an example for this is that what they affect isn't something you can see directly: the amount of memory that may or may not get allocated. `reserve` _might_ do the same thing, but also might not, and is deliberately under-specified so that different allocators can choose what to do.\n\n I'm also open to improving any example, but without a concrete suggestion, I don't think we can move forward here. If you (or anyone finding this ticket later) can think of something, please leave a note and I'll re-open!\n",
