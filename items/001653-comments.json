    "body": "Thinking about this now, I think that if we were to use an iface, we would probably want to have the core imports bring the impls into scope for the built-in types.  This would allow people to override them on a file-by-file basis, as well as allowing user-defined types to work with %d, %s, etc.  If the aim is not to allow user-defined types and customizable formatting, then I would advocate just casting to `u64`,`i64`, etc---it'll compile faster.\n",
