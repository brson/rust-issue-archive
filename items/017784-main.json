  "body": "This fixes a soundness problem where `Fn` unboxed closures can mutate free variables in the environment.\nThe following presently builds:\n\n``` rust\n#![feature(unboxed_closures, overloaded_calls)]\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = 0u;\n    let _f = |&:| x = 42;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this is equivalent to writing the following, which borrowck rightly rejects:\n\n``` rust\nstruct F<'a> {\n    x: &'a mut uint\n}\n\nimpl<'a> Fn<(),()> for F<'a> {\n    #[rust_call_abi_hack]\n    fn call(&self, _: ()) {\n        *self.x = 42; // error: cannot assign to data in a `&` reference\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = 0u;\n    let _f = F { x: &mut x };\n}\n```\n\nThis problem is unique to unboxed closures; boxed closures cannot be invoked through an immutable reference and are not subject to it.\n\nThis change marks upvars of `Fn` unboxed closures as freely aliasable in mem_categorization, which causes borrowck to reject attempts to mutate or mutably borrow them.\n\n@zwarich pointed out that even with this change, there are remaining soundness issues related to regionck (issue #17403).  This region issue affects boxed closures as well.\n\nCloses issue #17780 \n",
