  "body": "So far `librustc::trans::base::trans_fn()` and `trans_closure()` have been passed the list of attributes on the function being translated _only_ if the function was local and non-generic. For generic functions, functions inlined from other crates, functions with foreign ABI and for closures, only an empty list of attributes was ever passed to `trans_fn()`.\nThis led to the case that generic functions marked with `#[rustc_mir]` where not actually translated via MIR but via the legacy translation path.\n\nThis PR makes function/closure attributes always be passed to `trans_fn()` and disables the one test where this makes a difference.\n\nIf there is an actual reason why attributes were not passed along in these cases, let me know.\n\ncc @rust-lang/compiler \ncc @luqmana regarding the test case\n",
