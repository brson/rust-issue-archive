    "body": "It would be great to get this in some form, it can make generic programming a lot easier.\r\n\r\nSuppose I have a generic struct, and I need to implement several functions on it which all refer to the same \"complex\" type in their return parameters or arguments, and the type depends on generic parameters. This is a pretty common situation. Naturally I'd like to give that type a nice name and avoid typing it repeatedly.\r\n\r\nBut, there is no where for that declaration to go if it depends on the generic parameters of the struct.\r\n- It cannot go in the `struct` declaration itself because type aliases in a `struct` are not allowed.\r\n- It cannot go in the inherent impl, because of this issue.\r\n- It cannot even be a type alias defined in a function body, \"because it depends on an outer parameter\"\r\n\r\nIt seems I have to either\r\n(1) Make an entirely new trait just for this, and make my type an associated type of that trait\r\n(2) Use a macro\r\n(3) Just give up and type it out repeatedly\r\n\r\nIt's frustrating because in other languages there are better ways",

    "body": "> Keep to hear more about blockers\r\n\r\nThe most recent major blocker is fixing #108491 which is not easy it seems. Basically, you cannot use inherent associated types inside of structs, enums, unions or where clauses (as opposed to function bodies, constants and type aliases) and some function signatures without encountering a cycle error first. According to my current understanding this is due to architectural limitations in the compiler ([see this semi-related Zulip topic](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213817-t-lang/topic/Inconsistency.20in.20prohibiting.20.60Type.3A.3AAssocType.60), cc #22519 the equivalent for trait assoc tys).\r\n\r\nSince #109410 got merged, I'm investigating approaches to solve this in a proper way without too much rework.",
