    "body": "So this came up in the context of the specialization RFC rust-lang/rfcs#1210. Initially that RFC tried to rationalize inherent impls as being from an anonymous trait, but that language was pulled. Nonetheless, I (and @aturon) think that this behavior is basically a bug and we should deprecate overlapping inherent impls of this kind. The question is what the precise rules OUGHT to be.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- [ ] cannot have two inherent impls with the same fn, period.\n- [ ] cannot have two inherent impls with the same fn unless coherence judges them to be disjoint (using the overlap checker rules).\n",

Hopefully impact would be minimal. Still, it's not so hard to have types that are disjoint in practice, but not disjoint enough for the coherence checker -- particularly given the conservative rules imposed by RFC 1023.\n",

    "body": "I was just looking at some compiler code that relies on this pattern of inherent impls in a way that is not really intended to act as specialization would act. For example:\n\n``` rust\nimpl Binder<TraitPredicate> { ... }\nimpl Binder<LifetimePredicate> { ... }\n```\n\nThese two impls are really disjoint sets of methods with nothing in common. As it happens, I doubt that they have overlapping names, but if they did, there isn't necessarily a reason to expect that those methods would have the same arity (or purpose). In other words, they would be puns, not the same method specialized to different types.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this. Just pointing it out.\n",

    "body": "OK, @nikomatsakis and I discussed this some on IRC, and the consensus between us is that we do not need to impose any constraints on signatures. That is, the rule today should be: you can write whatever you like in inherent impl blocks, but if two blocks overlap on their `Self` type, they cannot contain items with the same name.\n\nThat rules out things like:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo;\nimpl Foo {\n    fn id() {}\n}\nimpl Foo {\n    fn id() {}\n}\n\nstruct Bar<T>(T);\nimpl<T> Bar<T> {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\nimpl Bar<i32> {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n```\n\nbut allows things like:\n\n``` rust\nimpl Box<Any> {\n    pub fn downcast<T: Any>(self) -> Result<Box<T>, Box<Any>> { ... }\n}\nimpl Box<Any + Send> {\n    pub fn downcast<T: Any>(self) -> Result<Box<T>, Box<Any + Send>> { ... }\n}\n\nimpl Foo<i32> {\n   fn abc(&self) { }\n}\nimpl Foo<u32> {\n   fn abc(&self, flag: bool) { }\n}\n```\n\nI believe that if we want to allow specialization of inherent impls in the future, we can make it work with this approach. It'd be mildly more subtle than a version that requires matching arities everywhere, but that's a pretty arbitrary constraint anyway.\n",
