The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nrc (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Hmm, I'm worried this is papering over the real problem here. Namely, I would have thought that the two distinct instances of the `Ty` representing each occurrence of `&Sized` would not be considered `Eq` to each-other (since they have distinct inference variables for the implicit region sitting in there, i.e. `&'_ Sized`.\n\nSo I'm not going to immediately r+ this (but I'm not going to close the ticket either) ... I just want to take some time to investigate this myself directly, and figure out if I should be calling something other than `breadcrumbs.contains` in the code.\n\n---\n\nUpdate: Ah, of course; the types in question have the form `for<'r> Fn(&'r S + 'r)` by the time that `dropck` sees them, and it is stashing breadcrumbs that include the bound region `'r`, even though those breadcrumbs don't make sense when we pop back out from the `for <'r> ...`\n",
