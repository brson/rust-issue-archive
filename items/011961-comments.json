    "body": "I understand where you're coming from, @huonw, and I'd like to add that this work you see here is not meant to represent a finished product.  This would of course be revised extensively to hopefully get rid of every instance of .clone() in the insert method, but the goal of this PR is to add new functionality that hadn't yet existed for this data structure, and to get the algorithm for insertion \"on paper.\"  I originally began the implementation of the insert method with &mut self in the method signature, but this was unsuccessful in my first few attempts and @catamorphism suggested that the method should take self, rather than a reference to self.\nI understand if you're not convinced by that explanation.  Maybe @catamorphism can do a better job of explaining the goals and process behind this PR.\n",
