    "body": "So it would just be a thin wrapper around [this private method](http://doc.rust-lang.org/src/collections/home/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/nightly-linux/build/src/libcollections/dlist.rs.html#180-191) of Dlist, then?  It's just an optimization to not reallocate the Node after a pop_front?\n\nI proposed something similar to be provided by most collections [in collections reform](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/235#issuecomment-57937028):\n\n```\n/// Move all the elements in the tail portion of this structure into a new structure\n/// For sorted maps/sets this would be a key. Not really appropriate for hashmap or priorityqueue.\nfn split(&mut self, at: &uint) -> Self;\n```\n\nWould this be an acceptable generalization of the desired functionality?\n",

One thing I was pondering doing was putting all the list logic into a cursor type which knows how to iterate/insert/delete/read/write/split etc. This type can be exposed publicly for those who want the control, and all the lists own methods can be written in terms of the cursor. It seems like what you're writing has the potential to do that. I'm not super thrilled that you've opted for hyper-unsafety, though.\n",
