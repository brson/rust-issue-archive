    "body": "Can this hold off on adding `#[inline]` for now? Right now it tends to incur a little too much compile-time overhead for not enough runtime win. For example I've never seen `OsStr` manipulation at the top of any profile.\n\nOther than that I think that this is fine, the only question being about how we want to pursue these methods into the future. Do we want to duplicate the API surface area of strings onto OS strings immediately, or incrementally? What we have today is kinda the \"bare minimum\" to get by with the plan to \"expand if necessary\". I'm somewhat against adding apis incrementally over time as it's bound to just be surprising that OsStr doesn't implement a method or two, so it may be worth taking time to plan out what the final API of OS strings might look like in the long run.\n\nThat being said I do think it's fine for these to enter in an unstable fashion, for now. If it turns out that everyone _really_ wants these two methods then this is as good a way as any to test the waters.\n",

    "body": "@Stebalien we actually discussed this today in some libs triage, and we ended up reaching the same conclusion! After a quick overview of the string/osstr apis, we concluded that the \"end goal\" for what OsStr exposes may end up just being the Pattern methods on strings. Most other methods didn't seem to apply, and the pattern ones all generally seemed to fit nicely (including `starts_with` and `ends_with`). \n\nThere may be a possibility of generalizing the `Pattern` trait to work for OS strings as well (cc @Kimundi, the author of the trait), but we can also start out conservatively and assume that a \"pattern\" is \"something that can be an OsStr\" to start off with.\n",

    "body": "Hm, right now I see two possible ways to generalize the pattern API to Osstrings:\n- Make the slice type a generic paramter of the trait, and add seperate impls for `Pattern<'a, str>` and `Pattern<'a OsStr>` (and maybe `Pattern<'a, [T]>` as well). That _should_ be relatively easy to do, but makes the API of the actual methods more complicated to read (`where P: Pattern<'a> -> where P: Pattern<'a, str>`). That said, it doesn't look that terrible either. Would be nice if we could do `type Pattern<'a> = GeneralPattern<'a, str>` I guess.\n- Change the Pattern API to work with any kind somehow searchable slice, and have wrapper around that that exposes it for `str`, `OsStr` and maybe plain `[T]`. Might reduce code duplication somewhat, but might also just be a more complicated variations of option 1. Also, its unclear if we could have specialized search algorithms as easily with this.\n",
