The existing `Ord` and `Eq` would be called `PartialOrd` and `PartialEq` and `deriving(Eq, Ord)` will implement them automatically.\n\nThis improves the current situation by allowing generic code using the total ordering to have the operators available, while also allowing floating point to continue having deriving of partial ordering available. It's not simple, but it's also not more complex than the current situation so I think it's a clear improvement.\n",

    "body": "I agree that this would be an improvement, but why not just merge the two traits (`PartialOrd` and `Ord`) instead of having two? Then sorting could use `<` (partial) while binary search trees could use `.cmp()` (total), with both being grouped under the `Ord` trait.\n\nTo be clear:\n\n```\ntrait Ord {\n    fn lt -> bool { self.cmp(other) == Less }\n    fn le -> bool { self.cmp(other) != Greater }\n    fn gt -> bool { self.cmp(other) == Greater }\n    fn ge -> bool { self.cmp(other) != Less }\n    fn cmp -> Ordering;\n}\n\ntrait Eq {\n    fn eq -> bool { self.equals(other) }\n    fn ne -> bool { !self.eq(other) }\n    fn equals -> bool;\n}\n\nimpl Ord for f32 {\n    fn lt -> bool { *self < *other }\n    ...\n    fn cmp -> Ordering { transmute::<&f32,&i32>(self).cmp(transmute(other)) }\n}\n\nimpl Eq for f32 {\n    fn eq -> bool { *self == *other }\n    fn ne -> bool { *self == *other }\n    fn equals -> bool { self.cmp(other) == Equal }\n}\n```\n\nThis solution: (a) provides IEEE 754-compliance; (b) works with hash tables, including using NaNs as keys; (c) supports sorting arrays of floats; (d) has the simplicity of only two traits; (e) works with deriving; (f) \"does the right thing\" in the vast majority of circumstances, the biggest hazard being people using `.cmp()` on floats and expecting it to behave like the mathematical notion of floating comparison (but I think there is little we can do about that, since the mathematical notion of less-than in IEEE 754 just ain't total).\nI am not opposed to merging this PR as a stopgap.\n",

    "body": "Floats have multiple orderings useful in different cases, so the only reasonable solution seems to be to force the user to explicitly select which ordering they want for floats.\n\nIn practice, that means accepting this pull request and adding a bunch of newtypes implementing normal order with NaNs banned, integer order, IEEE 754 total order, normal order except for -nan < -inf, and so on.\n\nBTW, I think IEEE 754 total order can be implemented like this, which shouldn't be terribly inefficient (at least if the float is in memory, and thus doesn't need to be moved from FPU registers to ALU registers):\n\n```\nfn total_order(af: f32, bf: f32) -> Ordering {\n    let a: i32 = unsafe {transmute(af)};\n    let b: i32 = unsafe {transmute(bf)};\n    if (a & b) >= 0 { // both positive, or different signs\n        a.cmp(b)\n    } else { // both negative\n        b.cmp(a)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nor without the if:\n\n```\nfn total_order(af: f32, bf: f32) -> Ordering {\n    let a: i32 = unsafe {transmute(af)};\n    let b: i32 = unsafe {transmute(bf)};\n    let mask: i32 = (a & b) >> 31; // if both negative, all ones else all zeroes\n    (a ^ mask).cmp(b ^ mask);\n}\n```\n\nEDIT: fixed, oops, also improved\n",
