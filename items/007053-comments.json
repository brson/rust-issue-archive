Rob Pike may abhor syntax highlighting, but we have no such aversion.\n\nThirdly, we already give a good error here:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let c = \"foo;\n    let d = \"bar\";\n}\n```\n\n```\nnl.rs:3:13: 3:16 error: unterminated double quote string: \";\n}\nnl.rs:3     let d = \"bar\";\n                     ^~~\n```\n",
