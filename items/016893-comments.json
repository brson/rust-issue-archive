    "body": "This is just because rustdoc inserts runs each test as it's own binary, by inserting `extern crate $your_crate;` (if `extern crate` doesn't occur in the example) and wrapping the contents in `fn main() { ... }` (if `fn main` doesn't occur in it).\n\nSpecifically the crate is being loaded without loading macros: there is no `#[phase(plugin)]`. While this is all feature gated I'm inclined to leave it this way, but maybe the requirement for `#[feature(macro_rules)]` on the main crate is enough to opt-in to rustdoc inserting `#[phase(plugin)]` too.\n\nIn any case, you can work around this  by manually loading the crate in the example:\n\n``````\n```rust\n#![feature(phase)]\n\n#[phase(plugin, link)] extern crate foo;\nfn main() {\n    // example here\n}\n```\n``````\n\nLeading `#` allow you to control the output precisely, e.g.\n\n``````\n```rust\n# #![feature(phase)] #[phase(plugin, link)] extern crate foo;\n# fn main() {\nassert_eq!(Mat::zeros((2,2)), mat![0, 0; 0, 0])\n# }\n```\n``````\n\nwill display the same way as your example there.\n",
