    "body": "Incidentally, it seems to me from a usability perspective that syntax extensions are processed too early in the pipeline. Dealing with the raw AST causes some super weird stuff, like `std::option::Some(s)` being an `expr_call_global` and `std::option::None` being an `expr_path`. It would be nice if processing happened after everything was parsed and resolved so you could explicitly declare a `variant_constructor` or something like that.\n\nI realize that it's probably not something that would be reasonable to do at this point. A version of `syntax::ext::build` that worked at a higher level of abstraction could probably get you most of the way there. At the very least, an extra output mode of `--pretty` that's a tabified version of the `ast::Crate` would be helpful to see what the AST of something you want to make looks like. I spent a long time thinking that `std::option::Some(s)` was supposed to be an `expr_struct` until I added a `printfln!(crate)` to `rustc::driver::pretty_print_input` and manually tabified the output of a trivial program. I think this kind of support will be especially important once syntax extensions are dynamically loadable and it becomes more reasonable for people not already extremely familiar with the compiler's internals to write them.\n",

This results in a compile-time failure if the environment variable isn't defined.\n- `env_option!` takes only one argument and returns an option of a string.\n",

    "body": "Would you mind changing the `error-pattern` tests to using `//~ ERROR:` instead? That makes sure that you emit the right span on the error message and that there's no other error messages at the same time.\n\nAlso, I'm a little worried about requiring these variables for rustc. Personally more than once I've compiled rustc by hand (mostly to check syntax/types). I never use the resulting library, but it would be a little annoying to have to make sure these variables are defined. That being said, I'm probably only one of few who does this, and I could have some shell startup stuff which sets these variables, so I'm not that worried. Basically r+ with the test changes.\n\nAnd if you're at it, would you mind changing the copyright years on the files to 2013 instead of 2012? Thanks again for doing this!\n",
