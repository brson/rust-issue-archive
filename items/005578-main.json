  "body": "Hey folks,\n\nThis patch series does some work on the json decoder, specifically with auto decoding of enums. Previously, we would take this code:\n\n```\nenum A {\n    B,\n    C(~str, uint)\n}\n```\n\nand would encode a value of this enum to either `[\"B\", []]` or `[\"C\", [\"D\", 123]]`. I've changed this to `\"B\"` or `[\"C\", \"D\", 123]`. This matches the style of the O'Caml json library [json-wheel](http://mjambon.com/json-wheel.html). I've added tests to make sure all this work.\n\nIn order to make this change, I added passing a `&[&str]` vec to `Decode::emit_enum_variant` so the json decoder can convert the name of a variant into it's position. I also changed the impl of `Encodable` for `Option<T>` to have the right upper casing.\n\nI also did some work on the parser, which allows for `fn foo<T: ::cmp::Eq>() { ... }` statements (#5572), fixed the pretty printer properly expanding `debug!(\"...\")` expressions, and removed `ast::expr_vstore_fixed`, which doesn't appear to be used anymore.\n",
