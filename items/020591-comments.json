    "body": "Yeah, span_note, sorry. So, actually, ImportResolution is a more likely candidate for this. That represents a `use` and the resolved module it points to (in fact, potentially two modules, one in each namespace). The ids in ImportResolution are, I think, ids for the use expression. You should be able to look these ids up in th ast_map in the current Resolver, the ids should always point to `use` AST nodes and these should have spans associated which you can pass to span_note. The slight complication is that the functions that check for conflicts don't always take an ImportResolution (the caller looks up the Target of the resolution) - you'll have to change that.\n",

    "body": "Whether you want the type or value id depends on whether the new import is importing into the type or value namespace. It might be both, in which case you might need to check which id is already used (if both are set, then they should be set to the same value and you should probably assert! that).\n\nThe ast map is a mapping from node ids to ast nodes, so to find an ast node, you lookup the node id in the ast map. Check out libsyntax/ast_map/mod.rs to see the functions available. Since there are many kinds of nodes, you'll need to match the result to get the node you want, but there are convenience functions to do this in that file (expect_*) if there is not one for the node you need, add it. See libsyntax/ast.rs for all the node kinds. If you look in ast.rs you'll see how the span is stored, it is a bit different from node to node, some store it explicitly, some use the Spanned helper, but it should be clear which is which.\n",

    "body": "I realised that the ast_map won't in fact have the `use` imports in, but I needed this for something else so is fixed by #20963, you'll want to pull that in to your branch before it lands. You'll want `expect_view_item` (which is new in that PR).\n\nYou access the ast_map via `Resolver::ast_map`, I believe all the places you need to change are methods on Resolver, so `self.ast_map.expect_view_item(id)`.\n\nI'm not exactly sure where you're working, but there is usually a namespace arg to tell you which namespace you are dealing with - type is Namespace and its either ValueNS or TypeNS. If it's not obvious which namespace you're dealing with let me know which method you are in and I'll try to be more specific.\n",
