    "body": "@veddan can you quantify the cost that you are seeing? For example this is what I get:\n\n``` rust\n#![feature(test)]\n#![allow(warnings)]\nextern crate test;\n\nuse std::sync::Mutex;\n\n#[bench]\nfn pthreads(b: &mut test::Bencher) {\n    let mut buf = [0u8; 1024];\n    enum pthread_mutex_t {}\n    enum pthread_attr_t {}\n    extern {\n        fn pthread_mutex_init(lock: *mut pthread_mutex_t,\n                              attr: *mut pthread_attr_t) -> i32;\n        fn pthread_mutex_lock(lock: *mut pthread_mutex_t) -> i32;\n        fn pthread_mutex_unlock(lock: *mut pthread_mutex_t) -> i32;\n    }\n\n    unsafe {\n        let ptr = buf.as_ptr() as *mut pthread_mutex_t;\n        assert_eq!(pthread_mutex_init(ptr, 0 as *mut _), 0);\n        b.iter(|| {\n            assert_eq!(pthread_mutex_lock(ptr), 0);\n            assert_eq!(pthread_mutex_unlock(ptr), 0);\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n#[bench]\nfn libstd(b: &mut test::Bencher) {\n    let m = Mutex::new(());\n    b.iter(|| drop(m.lock()));\n}\n```\n\n```\n$ rustc foo.rs --bench -Copt-level=3\n$ ./bench --bench\nrunning 2 tests                                              \ntest libstd   ... bench:        21 ns/iter (+/- 1)           \ntest pthreads ... bench:        18 ns/iter (+/- 4)           \n\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 2 measured   \n$ rustc foo.rs --bench -Copt-level=3 -Clto\n$ ./bench --bench\nrunning 2 tests                                              \ntest libstd   ... bench:        16 ns/iter (+/- 1)           \ntest pthreads ... bench:        15 ns/iter (+/- 4)           \n\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 2 measured   \n```\n\nWhen inlining everything with LTO the costs basically entirely go away, and when calling across the library boundary (note that there's no virtual call, and this is intentional!) the cost is quite negligible.\n\nI definitely agree that the current design requires a virtual call when inlined across crates, and I've experimented with tweaking it such that this is not necessary, but I don't think that it's easily possible due to various safety concerns. I just want  to get an idea of what perf hit you're seeing.\n",

    "body": "> There is a truly immutable \"static\" (without a significant address, either) being used as a facade\n\nCould you elaborate on why you think this doesn't have a significant address? For OS-based TLS it needs a significant address as it mutates the memory and everyone needs to see the update. For ELF-based TLS it's also significant because of the mutations which need to be visible (and everyone needs to reference the same memory).\n\n> That makes it backwards incompatible to remove the indirection of the getter,\n\nRight, but we just need to inline the getter into destination crates, probably via an `available_externally` static which is marked constant in LLVM. This getter is trivially inlineable, so it's just a codegen problem to overcome.\n\n> I would personally prefer using `const`\n\nUnfortunately due to the current usage of `static`, I think this is out of the question.\n",
