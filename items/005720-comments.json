    "body": "This is expected behavior.  The reason is that you are allowed to take immutable references to mutable data, which causes the mutable data to be frozen.  (This is what is happening when you assign to `&int`).  But you can only freeze for a limited lifetime.  The assignment to `@int` is disallowed because that would be a permanent freeze.  It's possible we could allow this, but we don't today.\n",
