This is treating `String` as a \"collection of characters\", but it's actually specifically a collection of bytes that comprise a valid UTF-8 encoding of some sequence of characters.\n\nI guess this isn't really a strong objection, and it's primarily motivated by the fact that I don't like using `.push()` and `.pop()` on `String`, I much prefer `.push_char()` and `.pop_char()` to make it clear what's actually going on.\n\nIs there any actual use-case for having `String` implement `MutableSeq` or is this being done just because it can?\n",

    "body": "Nitpick: it behaves as a collection of Unicode _scalar values_.\n\nAlso, `String` does not actually behave the way a normal collection of scalar values would. Trivial example:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut s = String::new();\nassert_eq!(s.len(), 0);\ns.push_char('\\u2022');\ns.push_char('\\U0001F419');\nassert_eq!(s.len(), 2); // FAILS\n```\n\nOne would normally expect a collection's `len()` to change in lockstep with the number of pushes/pops (assuming no other mutating operations). This is not at all true for `String`.\n\nI think this is actually a big enough issue that `String` should definitely not implement `MutableSeq`.\n",

    "body": "@kballard Good point. Maybe `len()` method of `str` and `String` should return the number of scalar values? String already has complementary `char` and `byte` methods for a few things, like `push_char()`/`push_byte()`, `pop_char()`/`pop_byte()`, `shift_char()`/`shift_byte()`. We would add a `len_bytes()` method to return the number of bytes, and have `len()` return the number of Unicode scalar values, just as `push()` and `pop()` would add and remove Unicode scalar values.\n\nIt's worth noting that the two other collection traits of `String`, `FromIterator<T>` and `Extendable<T>`, are both implemented as `FromIterator<char>` and `Extendable<char>`.\n",

    "body": "> push_byte() and pop_byte() are unsafe functions, and personally, I think those should actually live as free functions in a collections::string::raw module (similar to how std::str::raw is where unsafe &str operations live). Although really we could actually remove them entirely and have clients use .as_mut_vec().push() etc.\n\nI'd be in favor of that.\n\n> I don't know, but it absolutely is the default assumption by effectively all potential String users, just as how Vec::len() is assume to be O(1).\n\nI probably wouldn't assume `Vec::len()` is O(1) a priori: `Vec` is backed by an array. I wouldn't assume much about the time complexity of an unknown `&Collection`'s `len()` method, unless Collection specified some constraint. The docs could be more explicit about the time-complexity of Vec's operations in general, especially for the innumerable trait implementations. For example, look at the documentation of Java's Collections framework. /bikeshedding\n\nAlthough you're right, String carries the properties of both a sequence of bytes and chars enough that it would be misleading to do this. I have a better idea: would these `push_char()`/`pop_char()`/`push_byte()`/`shift_char()`/etc fall under the category of a \"MutableStr\" trait? These methods could be refactored out into a more clear unit of organization.\n",

    "body": "@alexchandel \n\nThe only reason those traits exist is because they're adding methods to built-in types and you can't add methods to built-in types without a trait. There's also a chance that in the future we'll change the rules to allow libstd to define methods on built-in types so we can get rid of them.\n\nThe only exceptions in your list are `UpdateIoError` and `BoxAny`, which are used to add methods to certain parameterizations of other types.\n\n> The fact that those methods form a coherent, composable unit of behavior is reason enough to factor them into a trait.\n\nThat is not the general philosophy of the Rust standard library. Methods are only put into traits when either\n1. the trait represents a coherent set of methods that multiple types want to implement, or\n2. the trait is being used to add methods to a type defined outside of the crate (such as built-in types, or `Result<_, IoError>`), or\n3. the trait is working around a limitation in rust, e.g. `Box<Any>` (which, according to the `#[unstable]` attribute, will be removed once the requisite DST and coherence changes are made that will allow it to be a direct `impl`)\n\nMoving methods into a trait actually makes it harder for people to find in the documentation where a method comes from, makes it harder to call the method if they don't have the trait in scope, and bloats the prelude with more and more traits.\n",
