I'm doing a local build to do some more local testing.\n\nIt's clear that the PR implements only a subset of what is described in the RFC (e.g., I don't believe that notation like `T::U` works, where `T` is a type; the scoping of associated types in a trait is different; you can't use associated types outside of generic fns; etc.). We should probably carefully enumerate the functionality of the RFC and plan out how we are going to bring it all in (and when!).\n",

Of course that can be added later, if desired.)\n",
