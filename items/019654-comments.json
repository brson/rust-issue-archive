    "body": "I'm a little worried about the ergonomics of spawning a thread here, having to import `std::thread::Thread` and then calling `Thread::spawn` is a lot of \"thread\"s going on there. The precise API may rely on the names we settle on.\n\n@sfackler's suggestion is interesting to only have `Thread::new` and then you call `detach(self)`. As another data point, it looks like C++ [requires `join` or `detach`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/~thread) to be called or otherwise it will abort the process. We may not want to get that drastic, however. I'd personally be a little sad if spawning a thread required two function calls at all times, but it is somewhat consistent in that nothing is favored over another.\n\nAll that being said, I don't think I actually spawn threads that frequently, so it may be somewhat of a moot point.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Update: I've rebased (over proc removal in particular) and updated the API according to our earlier discussion. That is, `with_join` is gone, and instead `spawn` creates a joinable thread (returning a `JoinGuard`). Then you can call `detach` on the guard to get a detached thread.\n\nRegarding the question of what to do when dropping a `JoinGuard` that has not been joined: I believe that the unused result lint should suffice (`JoinGuard` has always been `must_use`).\n\nThe `Cfg` type has been renamed to `Builder`.\n\nI declined to add a top-level `spawn` function for the time being; I don't think that\n\n``` rust\nuse std::thread::Thread;\nlet t = Thread::spawn(f);\n```\n\nis any worse than\n\n```\nuse std::vec::Vec;\nlet v = Vec::new();\n```\n\nI've address most (but not quite all) nits -- please check over the docs for `std::thread` in particular. The most thorough documentation is at the module level, but I've added some repeat docs on the methods as well.\n\nI'll be working on getting this passing the test suite again, but I think it's ready for re-r?\n",
