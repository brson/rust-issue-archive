They have you use `map`/`fmap` with any generic function.\n\nIt's not very generic right now because it assumes that copying is the behaviour you want when one of the two is `None`. I would prefer just using higher-order functions to keep the behaviour clear and the API small. Are we going to add the other operators and functions in the standard library? It feels very wrong to me.\n\nDefining `Eq`/`Ord` has precedent in other languages and allows for deriving and containers to work well.\n\nDoes it really make sense to pass `Option<int>` to a generic math function making use of `Add`/`Mul`?\n",

    "body": "I would strongly vote for `Some(1) + None == None`. What we have is a function (`+`) over `T` and we want to lift it to a function over `Option<T>`. We can do this two ways (corresponding to 1. and 2. above):\n1. If the function forms a monoid with some identity element of `T`, we can replace any `None`s with that identity element and then use the function to combine them, returning `Some`. Note that in this case it actually makes more sense to return `T` and not `Option<T>`, because we never return `None`.\n2. We can use the function to combine `Some`s returning `Some`, or return `None` otherwise.\n\nThe latter works generically for any function. It's how Haskell defines the `Applicative` and `Monad` instances for `Maybe` (and is in fact the only way they can be lawfully defined). Note also that with 1., to be consistent, you need to depend on another trait impl that provides the identity element, so that `None + None == Some(0)`. I'm not sure if there's any principled formulation where `None + None == None`, `Some(a) + None == Some(a)`, and `Some(a) + Some(b) == Some(a + b)`.\n\nHaskell doesn't overload the numerical operators like this by default because the fully generic way to do it would be:\n\n```\ninstance (Applicative f, Num n) => Num (f n) where\n    (+) = liftA2 (+)\n    (*) = liftA2 (*)\n    ...\n```\n\nand that would overlap with every other `instance Num (Foo a)` (because overlap checking doesn't take superclass constraints into account).\n\n`MonadPlus` is unrelated to `+` except by name.\n\nI think having `Option` and `Result` behave differently would be surprising.\n",
