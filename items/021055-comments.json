    "body": "I'm somewhat wary about providing this method on semaphores as it's inherently a racy piece of information to inspect about a semaphore. There are perhaps some situations where when you see a particular number you know a particular fact, but in general once you see the value of a semaphore you don't actually know anything for certain.\n\nFor example the code snipped in the documentation is racy in that it may not actually unlock the semaphore a correct number of times.\n\nI think for now we may wish to be more conservative about the API.\n",
