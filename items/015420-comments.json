    "body": "We used to let gcc add the appropriate version of libgcc to linker command line, so the -static-libgcc switch would work.  Later, however, an explicit #[link(\"gcc_s\")] was added in libunwind.rs, which takes precedence.\nI suppose this could be reverted, however, if we aspire to invoke 'ld' directly, this wouldn't be a long-term solution.  To do this properly, we may have to add some support for conditional linking, similar to --cfg.\n",
