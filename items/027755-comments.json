There are some missing (like `saturating_mul` or `checked_neg`), and making sure we've got a full suite everywhere would ensure consistency!\n",

Arithmetic operations like `checked_add` _can_ be inherent methods, if the operands are supposed to be always homogeneous, but I don't see motivation for preferring inherent methods to a trait in this case.\nI'm against stabilizing arithmetic methods unless they are gathered together with casts and arranged in one coherent picture.\n",

    "body": "To clarify, yes, part of the motivation of inherent methods was doing away with the large soup of traits we used to have (and as @SimonSapin says, this allows you to avoid an explicit import). For numerics, specifically, we tried to move in the direction of concrete types and inherent methods, leaving abstractions/numeric hierarchy to traits than can be built externally and perhaps added later.\n\nThis has been a general approach in the standard library: avoid premature abstraction. The trait system makes it easy to create abstractions after the fact, and we prefer to see strong use cases before committing to them.\n\nFinally, as @glaebhoerl points out, the existing stable API surface already takes this approach.\n\n> I'm against stabilizing arithmetic methods unless they are gathered together with casts and arranged in one coherent picture.\n\nMost arithmetic methods are already stable. I don't understand the concern about packaging them together; can you elaborate? As I mentioned above, we're shy about numeric abstractions, having tried several times before 1.0 to build a hierarchy, before ultimately ditching the whole thing. I continue to think this needs to be baked out of tree, and don't see why it can't be.\n",
