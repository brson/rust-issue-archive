    "body": "So, I'm not entirely convinced this is a bug. I'd certainly want to think carefully about any particular fix.  For example, stopping at the recursion limit doesn't feel very good to me. IIRC (and this code has changed enough that my memory could easily be rusty (pun intended)), while we are expanding out the candidates, it can easily happen that a candidate after N derefs inserts something which is applicable to N-k derefs. For example, if we have a method like:\n\n```\nimpl Bar {\n    fn foo(self: Box<Rc<Self>>) // admittedly, not legal yet, but the code is trying to be prepared for it\n}\n```\n\nthen if we have a `&Box<Rc<Bar>>`, we have to deref 3 times to find out about the candidate which, in fact, will later match after only 1 deref.\n\nIt seems like stopping when we reach a cycle might be ok, but I don't like doing anything upon exceeding the recursion depth but reporting some sort of error. That has proven very hard to reason about in the past: the recursion depth is basically supposed to be the point where the compiler throws up its hands and says \"this compile neither succeeds nor fails because I got stuck\".\n",

    "body": "IMHO, the language should use the type that requires the least `deref`'s. This is how it currently works if more than one type in the chain matches. I'm not sure how the algorithm should be laid out. Your point about hitting the recursion limit not being the best option is very valid. However, simply doing a lookup back onto all the previously `deref`'d types would introduce a higher overhead when if we have larger chains.\nI also don't believe, that cycles itself should be forbidden, as they might prove usefull.\n",

    "body": "triage: P-low\n\nWe discussed this in the @rust-lang/lang meeting some today. General conclusion was that if we can in fact detect a cycle, that is probably OK. It's worth pointing out there is some code in trait matching that aims to detect similar cycles -- it does have some problems around regions though -- but also that we can probably ignore regions for the purposes of establishing these cycles. This may take a bit of investigation. However, basically if we DO detect cycles the proper way (not merely by exceeding the recursion limit), then it seems ok to permit cutting off the method call candidate search there.\n\nClassifying as low priority because while this use case would be nice to support, it's not urgent.\n",
