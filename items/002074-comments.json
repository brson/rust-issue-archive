    "body": "After a little more digging (and help from @brson ), here's what I figured about. The following code is similar, but compiles successfully:\n\n```\nfn main(args: [str]) {\n    let one = fn@() -> uint {\n      fn f() { fail; }\n      ret 42u;\n    };\n    let two = fn@() -> uint {\n      fn f() { fail; }\n      ret 42u;\n    };\n    one(); two();\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, rustc does generate two symbols with the same name (for the two copies of `f`) and llvm silently mangles the names. In the enum case, rustc complains because `trans_constant` calls `note_unique_llvm_symbol`. The latter function is only called in a few places in trans. @graydon -- can you explain this? (This seems to be your code.)\n",
