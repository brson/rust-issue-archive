So we're not really hiding the fact the utf-8-ness of strings. It seems like we need a consistent rationale about where and how to permit working with string data as utf-8-encoded.\n\n@brson Do you see these other methods as also encouraging poor hygiene? Or is there something that makes indexing particularly pernicious?\n",
