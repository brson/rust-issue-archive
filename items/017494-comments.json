    "body": "`init_elem` and `copy_memory` are clearly more specialized operations than skipping a bounds check.\n\nAs with many other deprecations (of safe APIs), these were eliminated as conveniences that weren't worth the extra API surface area. There's also a general push toward funneling conveniences through central traits/data structures, like `Iterator` and in this case `ptr`. The benefit is that conveniences added to these central structures have a multiplicative effect, and it's much easier to remember a single API surface rather than ad hoc convenience methods spread through different types.\n\nIf you want to do extensive unsafe work with slices, the simplest avenue would be to use `.as_mut_ptr()` once, and then apply as many operations as you like to the resulting pointer. And of course there's always the option to add extension traits providing any conveniences you like.\n\nIt's also worth noting that deprecations like these don't entail _never_ providing such conveniences in the future, if they are ultimately deemed worthwhile. But there has been a lot of accumulation of ad hoc APIs, and the stabilization process is trying to move things toward a somewhat minimalistic, consistent, coherent, clean, and reasonably ergonomic state heading toward 1.0. (For bigger changes, like conventions, or removing the collection traits, or consolidating the numerics hierarchy, this involves RFCs.)\n\nAs an aside, we should consider adding an `Index` implementation to raw pointers, which would recover ergonomics very similar to C's -- and all by funneling through raw pointers.\n",
