    "body": "Oh, no. I've realized this may not be the right way to make this fix. This performance problem is only an issue for those tests that are not run by our compiletest driver - if we make the fix this way then it will _probably_ speed up execution of our normal integrated test drivers, but vastly slow down the execution of the compiler tests (src/run-pass, compile-fail, etc.).\n\nI wonder how worthwhile it is to do this. @reedlepee123 can you measure the difference in time it takes to run `make check-stage1-std CFG_ENABLE_VALGRIND=1` both with and without this fix (you'll need valgrind installed), and also let me know how many cores you have? I'd like to know what impact this change has on testing performance; it may not make sense to do it at all. Be sure to run the command twice each time and only measure the second run, otherwise you could be measuring the time it takes to perform the rest of the build.\n",
