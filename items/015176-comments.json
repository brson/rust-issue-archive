Features that were accepted by the old 'process' of meeting discussions are considered to be grandfathered in (there is no RFC for DST for example).\n\n(For the record, the first PR for struct_inherit landed on the 26th Feb and the RFC process began around the 12th March (date of first PR). If struct_inherit were proposed now, it would need an RFC and indeed there are several proposed RFCs for development of the idea and no work has been or will be done until that's gone through the RFC process).\n",
