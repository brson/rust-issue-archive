    "body": "This is an interesting idea, but I suspect that the reason that `deriving!` has to occur where it does in the syntax (immediately above the definition of the item in question) is that the macro machinery does not have the ability to resolve a path.  (That is, macro expansion occurs before the resolve step, I think.)\n\nE.g. in your example of `derive!(marker::CovariantType<T>, (Eq, Clone))` it does not have the ability to resolve `marker::CovariantType<T>` to its definition (which it needs to expand into the desired `impl` being derived).\n\nI'll leave this open because I think some discussion might come up on how else to deal with `cfg`-conditional derived impls.\n",
