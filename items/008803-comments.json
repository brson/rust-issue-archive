One case was in the profiler where we have a enum for the categories and want to define an array of the size of the number of categories. I think a similar case occurs in rust-mozjs where there are a bunch of object types and we must make sure to get the number of reserved slots right or else things will crash.\n\nHow does retrieving the variants at runtime work?\n",
