    "body": "@jruderman The plan is to remove `drop` for 0.5, so all the existing tests will get converted to the trait. With that in mind, the test coverage here looks very good to me. Two things that I can think of that aren't covered here are parameterizing over the Drop trait and using it as an object - these things probably work fine, but `Drop` is special, and these are scenarios that real code will rarely use, so regression tests might be appropriate.\n\nI'm also curious about how trait/impl visibility works, and how that releates to `Drop`.\n",

    "body": "Regarding enums, that's fine.  It seems like we can (eventually) treat them the same we treat structs.  That is, we translate a `struct Foo { ... }` to `{ {...} }`.  If there is a drop implementation, it becomes `{ {...}, flag }`.  Presumably we can wrap enums in an extra struct layer in the same way.  This means that you can access fields or contents without caring about whether there is a destructor or not.\n",
