    "body": "This turns out to be a deeper issue. We should hold off on removing feature-gate for negative impls until it is resolved. The core issue that that negative impls with extra bounds become effectively negative bounds:\n\n```\ntrait NegFoo : MarkerTrait { }\nimpl NegFoo for .. { }\nimpl<T:!Foo> !NegFoo for T { }\n```\n\nNow `T:NegFoo` is effectively `T:!Foo` from https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/586. I am very nervous about introducing such unbounded negativity into the trait system (see e.g. #23086). I would like to (for now) limit negative impls in OIBIT so that they can't carry where-clauses -- or at least not more where-clauses than are needed for their types to be well-formed.\n",
