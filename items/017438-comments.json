I do wonder if the text about the overall design rationale for `String` should be kept somewhere more permanent -- perhaps in the guidelines? Let me know if you have any thoughts.\n",

    "body": "We may not necessarily need to lay out the guidelines for string-based api design in the documentation of `String` itself, but I would definitely think that it would belong in the guidelines. That said, we should certainly explain very clearly that a string is a utf-8 encoded sequence of bytes, no matter what. The [current documentation](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) is a little... sparse. (cc @steveklabnik, maybe a good module/struct to beef up the doc string for?)\n",
