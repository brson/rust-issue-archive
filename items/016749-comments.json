    "body": "A proc has the same behavior, so this isn't a difference with unboxed closures in particular.  It strikes me as intentional since rust defaults to immutability, and the only place where you can specify that you want mutability is on the original binding.  You can always write something like this instead:\n\n``` rust\nlet x = 0u;\n...\nlet mut x_copy = x;\nlet f = move |&mut:| x_copy = 42;\n```\n",

    "body": "The closure in the original example is capturing by reference, not by value as the description implies. In any case I added a test covering all the tests and will close this issue -- everything seems to be behaving reasonably. The one thing that surprised me is that you can mutate a variable declared as `let` from within a `FnMut` closure; it makes sense when you consider the desugaring. This seems to be the case that @japaric was initially attempting to test, and it indeed works as he predicted. I am not sure yet if this is a bug though.\n",
