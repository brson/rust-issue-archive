  "body": "As discovered in #20376, the MSYS shell will silently rewrite arguemnts that\nlook like unix paths into their windows path counterparts for compatibility, but\nthe recently added `:kind` syntax added to the `-L` flag does not allow for this\nform of rewriting. This means that the syntax can be difficult to use at an MSYS\nprompt, as well as causing tests to fail when run manuall right now.\n\nThis commit takes the other option presented in the original issue to prefix the\npath with `kind=` instead of suffixing it with `:kind`. For consistence, the\n`-l` flag is also now migrating to `kind=name`.\n\nThis is a breaking change due to the _removal_ of behavior with `-L`. All code\nusing `:kind` should now pass `kind=` for `-L` arguments. This is not currently,\nbut will become, a breaking change for `-l` flags. The old `name:kind` syntax is\nstill accepted, but all code should update to `kind=name`.\n\n[breaking-change]\nCloses #20376\n",
