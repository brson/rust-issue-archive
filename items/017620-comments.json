The reasons to have this behind a feature gate are (1) working through bugs and (2) the fact that at least the `[]` syntax may (in fact, is likely to) change or disappear before we finalize. (And the `mut` syntax may change as well, I know @nikomatsakis had some further thoughts on that.)\n\nThat said, it seems fine to land the _internal_ use of this syntax for now.\n\nI'm willing to review this PR.\n",

As far as I know, taking them by value is strictly more general, because you can always say:\n\n``` rust\nimpl<'a> Slice<&'a Idx, T> for U { ... }\n```\n\nto allow references with arbitrary lifetimes. But for `Copy` data (the common case, since these are usually `uint`s), allowing it to go by value is more convenient.\n",
