  "body": "This patch adds GRSecurity compatibility to the Rust build process, fixing issues #1708 and #3641.\n\nIt adds an extra flag to ./configure called `--enable-pax-marks`, which will lead to the application of the PaX MPROTECT disable flag on all retrieved and compiled rustc binaries. This requires the `paxctl` binary to be installed.\nAdditionally, the configure process has been altered to attempt to automatically detect a running GRSecurity kernel and set aforementioned option as a result, unless `--disable-pax-marks` has been explicitly passed as a ./configure flag.\n",
