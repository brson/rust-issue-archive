    "body": "I think it's almost misleading to call `~` and `@` boxes and not pointers (or at least handles). Sure, from the type system perspective, the interesting bit is the behavior of box they point at, but it seems nicer to me to talk about them in terms of what you get in your stack frame or inside your struct when you declare one, that is, to say that `let x = @42` makes `x`  a pointer to a boxed 42 rather than that it is a box that happens to live behind a pointer indirection or something weird like that, and if you say `let y = x;` you don't suddenly have two boxes, just two pointers. Or handles.\n\nAnyway, I kind of like the \"owned\"/\"shared\" dichotomy, and it's not _really_ inaccurate to say that `~T` and `@T` are owning and sharing pointers to owned and shared boxes, respectively.\n\n\"Reference\" feels weird. Calling it a reference more clearly delineates it from ~/@ but the \"borrowing\" verbage is probably not going anywhere in either case, so it might as well stay in the name, and \"borrowed\" fits in nicely with \"owned\"/\"shared\".\n\nI like \"unsafe pointer\" because it conveys that you're on your own with regards to convincing yourself that it's okay to dereference it. \"Raw\" doesn't really imply much beyond maybe not being as fully-featured as the other, cooked pointer types, but \"unsafe\" sort of suggests that you get to do all that uninhibited offsetting and casting and whatever you might feel the need to do as a C programmer without the compiler looking over your shoulder. Though if we end up calling all the other ones something besides pointer, that's moot.\n\nSorry, that's a bit rambling, but I felt like I needed to get my two cent in before this bikeshed departs for good.\n",
