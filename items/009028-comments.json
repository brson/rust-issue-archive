    "body": "I think this may just point to a need for clarification in the docs.  I'd expect ToJson to perform a conversion to json that creates a very specific representation of whatever type implements it.  On the other hand, I expect Encoder to perform a conversion that creates a more general representation which is therefore available to more types.\n\nUnfortunately, the difference is not very clear in the docs, and ToJson and Encoder/Decoder were indeed very intertwined, and may still be.\n",
