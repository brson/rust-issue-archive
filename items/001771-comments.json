I believe that's \"what uv needs on windows\", in the sense that UTF-16 is the interpretation of the `wchar_t`-based \"W\" APIs in win32 accept. Unicode is our primary concept of text, and UTF-16 is the \"extra\" silly encoding we need to speak unicode in most places.\n\nI don't think the latin-1-and-supersets stuff is really worth trying to support, or at least not in libcore. I'd prefer not to require libcore to model codepages or other locale artifacts. It's a huge task, we'll probably delegate most of it to libICU, and lots of software is never localized. For at least those reasons I'd prefer we leave locale stuff to libstd.\n\nI do expect to modify all the windows API calls we use in libcore to call the \"W\" variants with UTF-16 input, not the \"A\" variants with (broken) UTF-8 as we're doing today.\n\nClosing this.\n",
