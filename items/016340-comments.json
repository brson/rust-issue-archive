    "body": "> Does this mean (it seems to) that linking to arbitrary pre-compiled C libraries is no longer supported, unless they had been compiled with -fPIC?\n\nLinking to arbitrary static C libraries is still supported. Since Rust is using full ASLR by default, those libraries need to be compiled with either `-fPIE` or `-fPIC`. An alternative is passing `-C relocation-model=dynamic-no-pic` to disable ASLR if you don't care about security.\n\n> But what about (say) linking to proprietary code supplied as .a archives, where rebuilding may not be possible? I don't have a big problem here, but was this well-thought, or is it a case of just trying something because it sounds good?\n\nASLR is not just something that \"sounds good\". It's an important exploit mitigation even for a memory safe language like Rust, because there's a significant amount of code in `unsafe` blocks and C libraries. You can still choose to build without support for ASLR.\n",

My frustration is more of a meta-comment:  that I found out only when my code was broken, and it took a few days, and tracking the signs from others who were also broken, to figure out what happened.\n\nI get that Rust is pre-release, and expect breaks.  There will always be changes, I hope.  I want there to be a process.  In the morning I download the nightly, and rebuild; then sometimes I have to go haring off on side-trips to find out what I didn't see coming; and it's not always very clear.\n",

You don't ever need to disable it, you can build the static C libraries with `-fPIE`.
