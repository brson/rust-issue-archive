  "body": "Taking a shareable loan of a `static mut` is safe if the type contained in the\nlocation is ascribes to `Share`. This commit removes the need to have an\n`unsafe` block in these situations.\n\nUnsafe blocks are still required to write to or take mutable loans out of\nstatics. An example of code that no longer requires unsafe code is:\n\n```\nuse std::sync::atomics;\n\nstatic mut CNT: atomics::AtomicUint = atomics::INIT_ATOMIC_UINT;\n\nlet cnt = CNT.fetch_add(1, atomics::SeqCst);\n```\n\nAs a consequence of this change, this code is now permitted:\n\n```\nstatic mut FOO: uint = 30;\n\nprintln!(\"{}\", FOO);\n```\n\nThe type `uint` is `Share`, and the static only has a shareable loan taken out\non it, so the access does not require an unsafe block. Writes to the static are\nstill unsafe, however, as they can invoke undefined behavior if not properly\nsynchronized.\n\nCloses #13232\n",
