    "body": "`rustc` and `cargo` only use terminal colors if the terminal they are in is a TTY. The only way they can tell whether they are in a TTY is by checking whether `GetConsoleMode` succeeds, which only succeeds on standard Windows consoles. The typical msys bash that Git for Windows provides uses the standard Windows console and thus colors are enabled. When using mintty you are no longer using a standard Windows console and `rustc`/`cargo` have no way to know whether they are in a terminal (mintty exposes stdin and stdout as nothing more than pipes), thus colors are disabled. If you force enable colors then colors will work fine, but AFAIK there's no convenient way to always force enable it. When you are using `term` you're not first checking whether the terminal is a TTY, thus it works fine.\n",
