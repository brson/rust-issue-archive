I want all other primitives to live elsewhere, while this crate will have only the very core primitives. I have preserved the visibility of our concurrent queues to preserve backwards compatibility for now. I would prefer to make these all private modules for now.\n\nAs an example, I would like futures and task pools to live outside of libstd. I have left them in libsync and libstd for backwards compatibility for now. Also I wanted to keep the diff count down.\n\n> Also, I agree w/ huon about the unfortunate rt dep. Obviously a lot of concurrent types need it, but atomics at least would be nice to have in core (or somewhere not dependent on rt).\n\nI'm a little confused by this, `core::atomics` exists, and it is impossible for any of these primitives to be written without depending on librustrt. The primitives are fundamentally written with the ability to deschedule and reschedule a task.\n\nThe `AtomicOption` type can in theory live in liballoc, but other than that I believe everything must depend on librustrt.\n\n> We could double-reexport atomics (core -> sync and core -> std)\n\nThis is exactly what is currently happening.\n\n> Travis failed.\n\nIndeed!
