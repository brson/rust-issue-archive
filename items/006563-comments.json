    "body": "Please reconsider this feature request; Unix permissions are most easily expressed using octal permissions. \n\nWhile expressing permissions via binary 0b111_101_101 is workable, I suspect most of us would do the mental arithmetic to re-write that to 0o755. Clever macros can mask some of this -- see e.g., https://gist.github.com/kmcallister/7312179 -- but asking each chmod() or umask() user to either re-implement them or discover and import such a package feels awkward compared to supporting 0o ... syntax directly in the language.\n\nThanks\n",
