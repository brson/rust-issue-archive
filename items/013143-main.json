Closes #9227.\n\nAs discussed at the end of the comments for #9227, I took an initial stab at adding support for function level statics and decided it would be enough work to warrant being split into a separate issue.\n\nSee #13144 for the new issue describing the need to add support for function level static variables.\n",
