    "body": "Probably should also incorporate #3775 once we rebase to trunk.\n\nConsider #5403 too.\n\nMy [wip](https://github.com/brson/llvm/tree/wip) llvm removes the GC patches, removes clang and adds your ARM patches. It doesn't rebase onto LLVM trunk, though, nor resolve #3775, which will probably be solved by resetting `compiler-rt` to trunk and dropping our patches there.\n\nI'm going to test this here today, but I'll be out of the office most of next week so won't be able to land it yet. @ILyoan if you want to speed this along you might want to try rebasing 'wip' onto LLVM/compiler-rt trunk and try to get it building on linux/mac/windows. Since you have commit access you can test against the bots by pushing to mozilla's `try` branch. Then you can go to the buildbot's [builders](http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders) page and force builds of all the try branches. Note that to rebuild LLVM on the bots you need to set 'Property 1 Name' to `clean-llvm` and the value to `1`. Also 'revision' needs to be the commit hash and (I think) 'branch' needs to be 'try'.\n",
