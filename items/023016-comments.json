    "body": "> I haven't looked into the details, but do you also derive Clone for #[derive(Pod)] or #[derive(Copy)]?\n\nNo, the [plan](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/17884#issuecomment-58582308) was to do that in the type system with a blanket impl for `Pod` implementors:\n\n``` rust\nimpl Clone for T where T: Pod {\n    fn clone(&self) -> T {\n        // NB safe! this a memcpy of Pod data (no owned/refcounted/`drop`able data here)\n        unsafe {\n            mem::transmute_copy(self)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBut! It can't be done right now because it needs negative bounds to handle some coherence problem (overlapping impls).\n\nI think it may be possible to do it in syntax extension (have `#[derive(Pod)]` derive Pod and Clone, and have `#[derive(Copy)]` derive Pod, Clone and Copy), but I feel uncomfortable with that approach because a bug in the expansion may yield a struct that's not `Pod` (let's say the `Clone` impl missed a `T: Pod`, and now the struct is not `Pod`) but can be cloned via a memcpy (`transmute_copy`)! The blanket impl approach is immune to that class of bug.\n",
