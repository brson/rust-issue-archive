    "body": "Hm this is not quite how I interpreted #22926 as I think we may want to expose a `file_name` accessor but any sort of other path calculation can be done through the filename and the root when gained from another source.\n\nThat being said, additions to the standard library now require an RFC accompanying them so the issue likely needs to live in the RFC repo instead of this repo. Additionally, I'm going to close this for now due to the need for an RFC beforehand. Thanks for the PR, however!\n",
