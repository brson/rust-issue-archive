    "body": "One question raised during review is what representation these types should have on each platform. Currently they all have the native representation (e.g. `libc::timeval`, `LARGE_INTEGER`, etc) as this keeps lossless information as long as possible.\n\nAs a consequence, however, issues like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29970 come up where the types have the property that basic algebra does not work on them. For example `b + 1ns == b` may be true (along with other various properties). The reason for this is that the resolution of the native representation varies among platforms, meaning that small increments aren't actually representable.\n\nI _think_ that having a `(u64, u32)` representation would fix this, but it is a divergence from the platform types and now if a `SystemTime` is ever handed back to the standard library it'd have to do more conversions. May be worth it though?\n",

A note on the API from that -- The lack of negative durations makes constructing arbitrary times really painful, though I understand the reasoning that went into that. However, using `Result` for time comparison felt odd to me. It makes sense if you only expect monotonic time for use with `try!`, but it feels odd to use otherwise. Perhaps it would make sense to add another method `duration_since_time` or similar name, which returns an enum of either `Before` or `After`?\n",

It's true that the APIs weren't necessarily designed initially with ergonomics as the primary feature, but rather correctness in terms of not omitting various oddities here and there. It's an interesting point though that `duration_from_earlier` and how it's more tailored towards timing operations rather than synthesizing new timestamps. There may be some slight tweaks that make it a little more amenable to this kind of operation.\n",

    "body": "I'd like to re-raise the issue of renaming `Instance` that was brought up in the RFC discussion.  My vote would be to rename `Instance` to `MonotonicTime` or `MonoTime`.  My biggest concern with the `Instance` name is that it's not clear how it relates to `SystemTime`.  In reality they are both 'times', or instances in time, but the names do not make that clear.  Additionally, the C++ `chrono` API names them `system_clock` and `steady_clock`, it would be nice to be in line with that.\n\nAnother possibility is to rename `Instance` to `SteadyTime`, but in practice it's difficult to guarantee steady time. The C++ standard specifies the steady time guarantee, but in practice the implementations fall short.  If it's determined in the future that a steady clock is possible, then `SteadyTime` could be added as an additional type.\n",

    "body": "I've been using time2 in one of my projects, and I've been getting panics from \"overflow when subtracting Durations\". Unfortunately I haven't been able to repro this myself, but one of the users of my code has been getting it sporadically. I haven't been able to tell which subtraction could be causing them (they all look fine), and I've yet to get a backtrace back.\n\nI think its a bit of an ergonomic issue for subtraction to panic; if we want to disallow negative Durations, then it seems to me that subtraction should return a `Result` or `Option`.\n",

    "body": "The libs team discussed this during triage yesterday and we reached a few conclusions:\n- We decided to stick with the name `Instant` over the alternatives of `MonoTime` or just `Time`. As @wycats [pointed out](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29866#issuecomment-178242446) the term `MonoTime` seemed a bit niche, and we felt that the name `Time` was a bit \"too sweet\" and also may convey the wrong perception of a wall clock time, for example. Additionally, we felt that `Instant` was actually pretty representative of what it was, an instant in time.\n- We'll add `Sub` to `Instant` as it basically already supports it and is somewhat more readable than the method version.\n- The `duration_from_earlier` method will be renamed to `duration_since`\n",
