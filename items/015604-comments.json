    "body": "So as you might have guessed, this is the beginnings of refactoring the raw socket stuff that I had before in a way that doesn't require massive additions to the standard libraries. I have a follow up pull request which will require some subset of the additions to liblibc; I have a separate library which requires the rest.\n\nPerhaps I could figure out what additions are necessary and change this pull request to only add them? Or would you rather I include the additions with my follow-up pull request and only add the librustuv things here?\n",
