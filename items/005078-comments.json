    "body": "The assert does not have an inherent check for linked failure _per se_; the design is that the condition itself will trip if linked failure doesn't. In fact I think with this fix the spawn could even be unlinked.\n\nThink about it this way: either the child succeeds to unwrap, in which case the parent fails, or the child fails, in which case the parent gets through the unwrap but trips the assert. They can't both get through the unwrap successfully.\n",
