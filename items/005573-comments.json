    "body": "We discussed the `<expr> as @<Trait>` form in the meeting last night:\n  https://etherpad.mozilla.org/Meeting-weekly-2013-03-26\n\nI think the plan of record is to allow expressions of type `@T` to automatically coerce to `@Trait` without any explicit cast, and then remove the `<expr> as @<Trait>` form entirely; therefore we should not spend time documenting this form of cast, since it will be removed.  Closing.\n",
