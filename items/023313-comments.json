    "body": "I'll take this.\n\n@barosl Thanks for tackling this. I don't think your fix is the appropriate one here. If you notice, the example will compile fine if you drop the `ref` from the binding.\n\nIt looks like we're getting bitten by our old problem of `ref x` having a type of '&T' as opposed to just 'T'. In this case, this is problematic for the `check_match::constructor_arity` function. For non-structural types such as usize in this case, the arity of `ref x` should be 0 but is instead 1 due to the misleading type information.\n\nThe place to hunt for a solution will be around https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ee7696383f3423cdd17373ff9e75c01acd8e3417/src/librustc/middle/check_match.rs#L649-658.\n\n``` rust\n    let left_ty = if real_pat.id == DUMMY_NODE_ID {\n        ty::mk_nil(cx.tcx)\n    } else {\n        ty::pat_ty(cx.tcx, &*real_pat)\n    };\n```\n\nOne way or another, we will need this to be the type of the value being destructured, free from the idiosyncracies of `ref x`.\n",

    "body": "If we sanitize `left_ty` before passing it to another function, as you said, the following code would work:\n\n``` rust\nlet left_ty = match (&real_pat.node, &left_ty.sty) {\n    (&ast::PatIdent(..), &ty::ty_rptr(_, ty::mt { ty, .. })) => match ty.sty {\n        ty_int(..) | ty_uint(..) | ty_bool | ty_char | ty_float(..) => ty,\n        _ => left_ty,\n    },\n    _ => left_ty,\n};\n```\n\nBut I find this ugly, as it hard-codes the list of the non-structural types. It also has a nested `match` which is too deep, in my opinion. (Possibly due to my inexperiences)\n\nHow about modifying `constructor_arity()` directly? In that case, we can utilize `ctor` to guess the type of the previous row. I've updated the code in my pull request to reflect this approach. If it is not appropriate, I will change it again to apply the code above.\n",
