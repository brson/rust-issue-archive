  "body": "The right hand side of the comparison in these checks are values of type\nOption<&Path> which are normalized versions of the left-hand side, so they're\nnot guaranteed to be byte-for-byte equivalent even though they're the same path.\n\nFor this reasons, the command line arguments are promoted to paths for\ncomparison of equality.\n\nThis fixes a bug on windows where if a library was specified with --extern it\nwould then be picked up twice because it was not considered to have been\npreviously registered.\n",
