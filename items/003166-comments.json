    "body": "I believe the problem is that the field `short_name` is given the string `s`, which is only valid during the function call to `short_name()` itself.  In other words, all the lifetimes are _not_ the same.  You can make the compile like so:\n\n```\nmod argparse {\n    use std;\n\n    import std::map;\n    import either::{either, left, right};\n\n    struct Flag {\n        name: &str;\n        desc: &str;\n        short_name: option<&str>;\n        max_count: uint;\n        banner: option<&str>;\n        mut value: uint;\n    }\n\n    fn flag(name: &str, desc: &str) -> Flag {\n        Flag { name: name, desc: desc, short_name: none, max_count: 1, banner: none, value: 0 }\n    }\n\n    impl Flag {\n        fn short_name(self, s: &self/str) -> Flag/&self {\n            let new_banner : option<&str> = match self.banner {\n                    none => { none }\n                    some(value) => { some(value) }\n                };\n            Flag {\n                name: self.name,\n                desc: self.desc,\n                short_name: some(s),\n                max_count: self.max_count,\n                banner: match self.banner {\n                        none => { none }\n                        some(value) => { some(value) }\n                    },\n                value: self.value\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    let f : argparse::Flag = argparse::flag(&\"flag\", &\"My flag\");\n}\n```\n\nall the changes are in the declaration of `short_name()`, which becomes:\n\n```\n        fn short_name(self, s: &self/str) -> Flag/&self {\n```\n\nThe first change is that `s` becomes `&self/str` instead of `&str`.  Basically this means \"I need a str that lives as long as the borrowed pointers within self\".  `&str` just means \"lives as long as this function call\".  \n\nThe return type also has to change to `Flag/&self`.  This notation is not well publicized or known, but it means \"an instance of Foo containing borrowed pointers with lifetime `&self`\".  As before, the default is to return an instance of `Flag` containing borrowed pointers that are valid only for the call itself.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the detailed explanation and workaround. However, it seems to me that the actual issue is how the borrowed pointer inside self.banner is handled, as it is treated differently from the other fields.\n\nIf you take this implementation of short_name() (this is the one I should have posted earlier, instead of the version with 'match'), this fails with the \"mismatched type\" error:\n\n``` rust\n        fn short_name(self, s: &str) \u27f6\u2000 Flag {\n            Flag {\n                name: self.name,\n                desc: self.desc,\n                short_name: some(s),\n                max_count: self.max_count,\n                banner: self.banner,\n                value: self.value\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nHowever, this works:\n\n``` rust\n        fn short_name(self, s: &str) \u27f6\u2000 Flag {\n            Flag {\n                name: self.name,\n                desc: self.desc,\n                short_name: some(s),\n                max_count: self.max_count,\n                banner: none,\n                value: self.value\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nOne would expect to be able to copy optional fields the same way as mandatory fields. Is it an issue with rust expecting non-wrapped borrowed pointers to have a lifetime at least equal to that of their container, but not so with borrowed pointers wrapped in `option`/`either`? (Not that I have tested with `either` but there is no reason the same issues does not come up).\n",

What's happening is that the type checker is inferring, based on the types given in `short_name()`, that you want to construct an instance of Flag where the borrowed pointers within have the lifetime `&`.  This is the lifetime parameter given by the caller: it lasts as long as the current call.\n\nIn the first case, which reports an error, you have a region pointer in `short_name`, which has the lifetime `&`, and a second region pointer in banner (`self.banner`).  This has a different lifetime so an error is reported.\n\nIn the second case, the field banner is assigned `none`, which is a constant, and hence consistent with any lifetime, so no error is reported.\n",

If you wrote something like this:\n\n```\nstruct foo<T> { a: T; b: T; }\n\nfn main() {\n    foo { a: 3, b: \"hi\" };\n}\n```\n\nYou get an error reporting for the field `b`, even though you clearly meant for the types of `a` and `b` to be the same.  So what is happening here is that the compiler has inferred based on the `name` field what the lifetime of the other fields should be, and then it found that the latter fields (namely `banner`) were inconsistent with that.  (In fact the situation is completely analogous to the type parameter; there is in fact an implicit lifetime parameter on the type whose value is being inferred)\n\nI agree it would be nice if, upon encountering a type error, the compiler displayed all mutually inconsistent items.

    "body": "Sorry if I'm being a bit dense here. It's not the explanation of the error which I have an issue with, it's the fact that I do not understand why the region pointer in `banner` has a different lifetime from the rest. In spite of the fact that the borrowed pointer in `banner` is wrapped inside `option`, I expect it to have the same lifetime as, say, `desc`.\n\nLet me try another example. I'm going to henceforth banish all `option` fields from `Flag`, and attempt to create a new flag by passing `&s` to it, and copying the rest of the borrowed pointers from the old object. If I understand it right, it should not work without using the `&self/str` type for `s`: the lifetime of `s`, whether it's assigned to an `option` field or not, still needs to be at least equal to the lifetime of the object we are copying, correct?\n\nLet's find out:\n\n``` rust\nmod argparse {\n    use std;\n\n    import std::map;\n    import either::{either, left, right};\n\n    struct Flag {\n        name: &str;\n        desc: &str;\n        max_count: uint;\n        mut value: uint;\n    }\n\n    fn flag(name: &str, desc: &str)  ->  Flag {\n        Flag { name: name, desc: desc, max_count: 1, value: 0 }\n    }\n\n    impl Flag {\n        fn set_desc(self, s: &str) ->\u2000 Flag {\n            Flag {\n                name: self.name,\n                desc: s,\n                max_count: self.max_count,\n                value: self.value\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    let f : argparse::Flag = argparse::flag(~\"flag\", ~\"My flag\");\n    let updated_flag = f.set_desc(~\"My new flag\");\n    assert updated_flag.desc == \"My new flag\";\n}\n```\n\nShockingly, not only it compiles, but the assertion works!\n",
