The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @huonw (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the patch!\n\nI'm pretty sure the example does compile now: every merge is tested in detail, and this includes compiling most of the doc examples (specifically including this one). Unfortunately, there's confusion here since the compiled doc example wraps everything in `fn foo() -> std::io::Result<()>` but it is hidden in the rendered HTML docs (the leading `#` on those lines).\n\nI'm not sure the best way for us to handle this sort of thing (balancing good practice (using `try!`) with documentation focus and clarity), maybe @steveklabnik has more detailed thoughts.\n\nr? @steveklabnik \n",
