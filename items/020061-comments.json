It's an unfortunate perf regression to cause in the interim.\n\nI'm open to that -- we could leave them as `experimental` with a message indicating that they're likely to be removed. It's a bit frustrating because we could add `trusted_len` today to recover the performance, but it's likely that a cleaner solution will be available later.\n\n@reem \n\n> Was `back` vs. `last` discussed in an RFC? I'm not a huge fan of the renaming.\n\nNo, this was a bit of bikeshedding that came up during the first round of `vec` stabilization. The main problem is that `head` and `last` are inconsistent. Contenders are: `first`/`last` or `front`/`back`. I went with the latter because it's consistent with APIs elsewhere, e.g. for `DList`.\n",

    "body": "@bluss Thanks for bringing this to my attention! The RFC mistakenly had `remove` on `Vec` returning an `Option`, even though our intended convention for `Vec` operations was:\n\n> If it takes an index, panic on out-of-bounds, with the sole exception of `get`/`get_mut`\n\nThis was part of rolling out error conventions for `Vec`, after a lot of experimentation with different options (e.g. returning `Option` everywhere). Initially `Vec` was very inconsistent.\n\nThe reason for marking it stable here was that I _believed_ this was bringing into line with the old conventions RFC. However, as I said above, that RFC had a mistake.\n\nI'm going to file an amendment to clarify the intended conventions and their rationale. If discussion there determines it should be otherwise, there's still time to change before 1.0-beta.\n",

    "body": "> If it takes an index, panic on out-of-bounds, with the sole exception of `get` / `get_mut`\n\n@aturon, Where was this discussed? What is the rationale? It seems opposite with the earlier trend of avoiding panic when possible, e.g. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/11129. And taking an index seems a fairly arbitrary criteria for different error handling.\n\nIf you _want_ to panic on failure it\u2019s very easy to add `.unwrap()` on an `Option<T>`, but doing something else on failure with a method that panics is much more difficult since panic cannot be caught/handled.\n",

    "body": "@SimonSapin Some of the early discussion was [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/Meeting-API-review-2014-09-24.md#vecstring), although the repo seems to be missing the follow-up discussion after doing the experiment. This was also part of the (many, many) discussions about error conventions, though I don't recall how much was on IRC vs other forums.\n\nIn any case, two things:\n\n### Why I believe this is the right guideline\n\nI stand by the guideilne. It has a very simple rationale: almost all of the time, if you have managed to produce an index, either it's \"special\" (in practice, 0), or it was computed in a way that guarantees it's in bounds. \n\nFor special indexes (0 and len() - 1) we tend to provide convenience methods (like `pop`) which then return `Option` to allow you to fold in the check. We don't currently have a convenience for `remove(0)` -- it was removed earlier on, before these conventions -- but we should.\n\nFWIW, I tried many variations on the error conventions for `Vec` during the first stabilization pass. In particular, I tried a variant that returned `Result` everywhere. Rolling it out in `std` and the compiler, I found that there were very, very few times where I could end up taking advantage of that result if the code was already computing an index -- as above, unless it was a \"special\" index I already knew it was in bounds. So it ended up cluttering a _lot_ of code with extra `unwrap`s for very little benefit.\n\nWhile we have moved away from panicicking in general, we are not doing so blindly. The [accepted conventions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/236) leave it to the API designer to choose what to treat as contracts (resulting in panics) and when to return results. It depends a lot on how a given API is used in practice and what knowledge clients typically have. The above guideline for `Vec`, besides being IMO the right tradeoff ergonomically, also makes `Vec`'s error handling story relatively simple, consistent and easy to predict.\n\nTo my mind, the pushback against changing `remove` really amounts to a request to add back `unshift`.\n\n### But I could be wrong!\n\nAs I mentioned above, I will be posting an amendment to the RFC to make sure these considerations are recorded highly visibly and to give people a chance to weigh in. If there is strong disagreement, there is still time to change the API before 1.0-final.\n",
