    "body": "+1   this makes perfect sense to me, I've independently discovered the need and I'm sure many others will, i think it will be very common.\n\nalthough |x|_x may not be many characters, its' more mental stages -faced with more complex single line expressions i would usually end up writing one-off helpers to make function bodies read more cleanly, even if it resulted in duplicate code. (what i'm saying is, if you *dont_ have the proposed clone function, many people will write it.. or soemthng else like .clone_collect() or .iter_clone() or whatever)\n\nPerhaps _anything_ that you can do in an operator would benefit from a helper-function that can easily be dropped into HOFs.. does that generalize ? (I'm reminded of how things work in haskell where operators are functions already)\n\ni have a big draw to this 'functional' style of working from experience with low level optimization on game-consoles in the past (various forms of parallelism, requiring extensive manual tweaking of when/where/how details of an expression are executed, to work around severe cache & pipeline hazards), so its very important to me - its a big reason i'm interested in Rust in the first place.\n\nOne real world example is breaking up a complex loop body into 2 or more passes to avoid overflowing the I-cache.  There are many cases where i need to manually reason about where something actually ends up... in my cases one is usually thinking about getting data into a specific layout\nanother is re-arranging data for use in SIMD instructions.. you might take some subset of a collection and filter/permute it ..\n",

The need to create this standalone functions is seen as a code smell that other features are missing, such as uniform method calls or cloning iterators. I worry about the slippery slope of adding more and more functions like this to work around language deficiencies. Let's be conservative and hold off on this, revisit later.\n",
