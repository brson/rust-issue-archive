    "body": "There are three facets to this: equality, logging, and cycle collection. For comparison, shape code is currently used only for `!=` and pattern matching of strings. For logging and cycle collection, it's used everywhere.\n\nThe fix for comparison is to add `ne` to the Eq trait and to make pattern matching of strings call into a magic string comparison lang-item.\n\nThe fix for logging is to make logging call into a magic lang-item that uses the visitor glue. (It should eventually be a macro.)\n\nThe fix for cycle collection is to either replicate the cycle collector with visitor glue or to switch to a conservative garbage collector for `@` boxes.\n",
