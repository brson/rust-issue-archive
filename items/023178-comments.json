This distinction was not present in the previous API.\n\n> The new version doesn't work if the file isn't present and I'm getting - the unfortunately not very telling - error:\n\nWhen displaying errors you should not be using `unwrap` or `{:?}` but rather `{}` to get errors that look like:\n\n```\nerr: No such file or directory (os error 2)\n```\n",
