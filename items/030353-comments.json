For example in doing this you can't change the way we link to native libraries like LLVM which I also suspect most distributions will want to do. Along those lines I don't think that we should necessarily support the use case of having our nightlies be ready for distribution in other package managers as-is. I also believe there are tools (patchelf maybe?) which can modify this sort of information on built artifacts.\n\nThe high-order bit here I believe is not what distributions are doing but rather what _we_ are doing. We go to great lengths to ensure that rustc is usable as-is on Windows, and the same should be true of Linux/OSX as well.\n",

    "body": "As a user, +1 for this change _for rustc itself_ (and rustdoc, cargo, etc.), for the official binary distribution, so that `rustup --prefix=/home/$USER` works. As far as I can tell, the previous issues have been about setting the rpath in generated binaries (which seems unnecessary given that the default is statically linking libstd), and about unconditionally setting it without a `./configure` option, which is no longer the case.\n\n@nagisa rpath is essentially just another source of search paths, alongside `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `/etc/ld.so.conf`, the hard-coded defaults. [Linux's man page for ld.so](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html) has a list of where it looks. Providing an rpath is harmless, unless there's a library at the rpath location that's unwanted.\n\nIt is true that we use `DT_RPATH` instead of `DT_RUNPATH`, so you can't override it with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. I'll file a bug about that.\n\nAlso, on current stable rust, the rpath I get from `-C rpath` is `$ORIGIN/../usr/local/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib:/usr/local/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib`. Is that... correct? I don't think it'll cause a prefixed compiler to find its own bits. And it seems like `/usr/local` shouldn't be included, and only the `$ORIGIN`-relative rpath should be included.\n",

Surely, those that care about the rpaths will notice their builds of newer versions will get one, and will look at how to remove it. But why not just change whatever script is used to produce the official builds to add --enable-rpath instead of changing the defaults for everyone?\n\nThat being said, I can understand that rustc developers also benefit from not having to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for themselves, which is why I have doubts.\n",
