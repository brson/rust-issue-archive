    "body": "As far as I'm aware, `noalias` just means that the two pointers don't directly point to overlapping ranges. Since you can imagine the fields of a struct as individual unique pointers within a \"top-level\" unique pointer, you couldn't get an overlapping range, since there would then be multiple pointers to the same data. The same logic applies to vectors/arrays.\n\nFinally, `noalias` only really matters if you are doing something that is affected by potential aliasing, I'm not too familiar with the scope of LLVM's inter-procedural optimization but short of deliberately constructing a pair of aliasing unique pointers, I'm having a hard time imagining a case that might cause LLVM to perform an invalid optimization.\n",
