  "body": "As outlined in\n\n  https://aturon.github.io/style/naming/conversions.html\n\n`to_` functions names should only be used for expensive operations.\nThus `to_option` is better named `as_option`. Also, putting type\nnames into method names is considered bad style; what the user is\nreally trying to get is a reference. This `as_ref` is even better.\n\nAlso, we are missing a mutable version of this method.\n\nFinally, there is a bug in the signature of `to_option` which has\nbeen around since lifetime elision: originally the returned reference\nhad 'static lifetime, but since the elision changes this become\nthe lifetime of the raw pointer (which does not make sense, since\nthe pointer lifetime and referent lifetime are unrelated). We fix\nthe bug to return a reference with a fresh lifetime which will be\ninferred from the calling context.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
