    "body": "So, my previous implementation would fail!() if the number of bytes being added where greater than 0x1fffffffffffffff. There really isn't any good reason for that since its a perfectly valid size to add. Admittedly this is a bit pedantic - in practice its just about impossible to process that many bytes at a time. However, the whole point of this chunk of code is to handle the case where someone attempts to process more than 2^64-1 (or 2^128-1) bits, which is something that I suspect no one has ever tried to do (who tries to hash 16 billion gigabytes?). The Sha1 and Sha2 standards do, however, define a maximum message size and the only alternative to enforcing that is to ignore it.\n\nAnyway, if we're going to be strict about enforcing the maximum message size, we might as well do it right. I've rebased the commits so that any \"bytes\" value should work. I also updated the performance numbers, although they stay basically the same.\n",
