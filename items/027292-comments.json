This is a common \"mistake\" I make, though I'm not really sure its a mistake since bors _still_ does not include the titles of PR's in its merge commit messages.  I.e. you should not assume that people can see the title; the PR's description should be able to stand on its own.  I often deal with this by just cut-and-pasting my title into my description's first line, to be honest.)\n",

    "body": "I have found a relatively simple example that will be mishandled by the current implementation:\n\n``` rust\nimpl CoerceUnsized<Pointer<Trait>> for Pointer<Trait> {}\nimpl<T: Trait> CoerceUnsized<Pointer<Trait>> for Pointer<T> {}\n```\n\nSelecting `<Pointer<Trait> as CoerceUnsized<Pointer<Trait>>>` won't be ambiguous, and it would result in the first `impl`.\nIt's harmless, because it will result in the same behavior as before this patch, but it would be better to detect this ambiguity (by manually looking at `impl`s, instead of using trait selection) and maybe even find the common supertype of the `Self` types of all applicable `impl`s (`Pointer<_>` in this case).\n",

    "body": "@eddyb not sure if you saw my comments on this; sorry it took me so amazingly long to read it. The main reason for the delay is that I feel like we need to get a better handle on coercions before we go and expand them, it's hard for me to tell if this approach is good or is something that will box us into a corner. A feature gate would make me feel a lot better about that. All that said, there is only so long we need to stall here-- I admit this patch is a lot cleaner and more elegant than I initially anticipated, and this may well be a part of the way forward.\n\nPerhaps a good idea would be to schedule a time to brainstorm and chat about this as a video chat. I'd also like to sketch out how this affects other scenarios that seem strongly related; I have a few in mind but have to go scouring logs to find the specific examples.\n",
