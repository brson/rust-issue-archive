When you were looking at these, did you notice an obvious trend which would make this pattern hard-coded in fewer places? I would expect that at least slice construction would be a pretty refactorable portion, but perhaps indexing may be as well.\n\nI'm also unfamiliar with the reasons for why we went with byte length as opposed to element count in the first place as well, and I'd want to understand why we did it before we change it.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton: I don't know why byte count was ever used for length/capacity in vectors and length in slices. It results in a division or checked multiplication + extra branch being required for correct bounds checks, and a division to convert to the commonly needed element length.\n\nThe _only_ time we use length in bytes is the amortized cost of reallocation in `push`, and similar functions like `reserve`. It doesn't make sense to micro-optimize the branch that's rarely taken and pays the much more expensive cost of an allocation already.\n",
