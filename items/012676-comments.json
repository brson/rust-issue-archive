    "body": "FWIW, the [error handling section of the `std::io` docs](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/io/index.html) doesn't mention `try!` at all (in fact, it barely mentions anything; I think improving that will be extremely helpful).\n\n> You can't use try! for 2 different Result types in the same fn; you have to switch to another strategy for one or split them out into separate fns.\n\nFor clarity, what do you mean by this? The following works\n\n``` rust\nfn f() -> Result<~str, Error> { ... }\nfn g() -> Result<int, Error> { ... }\n\nfn h() -> Result<f64, Error> {\n    try!(f());\n    try!(g());\n    // ...\n    Ok(3.14)\n}\n```\n\ni.e. the result type differing but the error param matching. (If the error param differs then there always needs to be some custom logic for converting them to the same type, and no generic macro can perform that.)\n",

    "body": "It's not mentioned in the docs, but as you say, not much is on the topic, and when people ask \"do I really have to use a match expr to handle IO errors?\", they're either going to find `try!` from examples on github/bitbucket/reddit, or pick it up from the mailing list or irc, like basically everything else in Rust right now.\n\nYou're correct, I was mistaken on the return type point, based on having read someone saying they hit issues with that rather than having tried it myself.  Apologies, I've updated the list accordingly.  That particular aspect is definitely not as big of an issue with that clarification.    \n",
