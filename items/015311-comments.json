    "body": "Has there been any progress on this? I only recently noticed this inconsistency, and it looks like `sort_by` has been stabilised even though `{min,max}_by` have not (due to this issue). I like @alexcrichton\u2019s suggestion about `_by` v.s. `_with`, but the stable `sort_by` does the opposite, using a comparison function even though it ends in `_by`.\n\nPython 2 provides both `cmp` (basically, `(T, T) -> Ordering`) and `key` (`T -> U`) parameters to its `sorted` built-in, but Python 3 switched to `key` alone, removing the old `cmp` parameter. Perhaps we should follow Python\u2019s lead and switch to key functions, although I\u2019m not entirely sure what the motivation for them is (other than simplicity in some cases).\n",

    "body": "Key functions would not work well for min/max things without a total order like floats. Ideally you would use comparison based `{min,max}_by` and then use a function like Haskells `comparing`, as @kmcallister mentioned in #17648, for when you only want to compare keys.\n\nUnfortunately, currently Rust functions cannot return a closure, so creating a `comparing`-like function seems impossible right now. So if it is comparison based it ends up being unergonomic for key comparison, and if its key based it ends up being difficult or impossible to express `min` or `max` for things without a total order.\n",

    "body": "Upon thinking more on this, I'm starting to convince myself that the scoring fn variant is not all that useful for Rust unfortunately. For example if you have a `struct Person` which has a `name: String` and you want to sort an array of people by their name, you'd in theory want to do:\n\n``` rust\npeople.sort_by(|person| &person.name);\n```\n\nUnfortunately you cannot return a reference into the argument passed into the closure, so this will not compile. This means you'll need to either call `clone` (bad) or move into a wrapper struct (bad). This somewhat indicates to me that we want `|A, B| -> C` for these functions.\n\nAdditionally, the interaction between `sort` and `max`/`min` is interesting in that `sort` can greatly benefit from the closure returning an `Ordering` (e.g. the item in question could go either left or right in the sort). The min/max functions, however, only really need a `bool` return value indicating whether `A` is less than `B` (or greater than). For this case, returning an `Ordering` is probably overkill and may even be more inefficient in some cases. \n\nThere is a downside, however, to not returning `Ordering`, which is that it's not super clear what the `bool` returned means. Does it mean that `A` should be accepted? Does it mean that `A` is the smallest? Does it mean that `B` is the smallest? This is somewhat countered by the fact though that the documentation could clearly say to call `a < b` which may solve this problem.\n\nAll this is basically leading me to:\n1. Scoring functions may not be too useful, so comparison functions should probably be favored.\n2. Comparison functions may only want to return `Ordering` when required, otherwise a `bool` should be favored for performance reasons.\n\nHow does that sound to others?\n",

I can see how the example \"score\" of `person.name` is bad, requiring cloning and all, but it's still useful when you're dealing with something that may be expensive to compute.  Suppose I have a list of directories, and I want the one with the biggest total size -- that recursive traversal is potentially expensive, but the resulting score is a value I can just `Copy`.  Yes, the `map` workaround is feasible, but a scoring `max_by` or `max_with` or whatever will still be nicer.\n",
