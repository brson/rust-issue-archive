I think we've started to settle on _not_ rolling our own crypto, so I'm not sure how much we want to pursue the convenience of these libraries. I can't imagine that there's any security reason to deny this, but I'm also not confident saying that.\n\nThe patch itself looks fine, to me it's a matter of more whether we wish to pursue maintenance of these modules.\n",
