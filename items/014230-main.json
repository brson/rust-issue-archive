  "body": "This commit is part of the libstd facade RFC, issue #13851. This creates a new\nlibrary, liballoc, which is intended to be the core allocation library for all\nof Rust. It is pinned on the basic assumption that an allocation failure is an\nabort or failure.\n\nThis module has inherited the heap/libc_heap modules from std::rt, the owned/rc\nmodules from std, and the arc module from libsync. These three pointers are\ncurrently the three most core pointer implementations in Rust.\n\nThe UnsafeArc type in std::sync should be considered deprecated and replaced by\n`Arc<Unsafe<T>>`. This commit does not currently migrate to this type, but future\ncommits will continue this refactoring.\n",
