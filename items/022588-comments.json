    "body": "Reading the RFC now, I see:\n\n  The `EndOfFile` variant will be removed in favor of returning `Ok(0)` from read on end of file (or\n  write on an empty slice for example). This approach clarifies the meaning of the return value of\n  read, matches Posix APIs, and makes it easier to use `try!` in the case that a \"real\" error should be\n  bubbled out.\n\nPOSIX APIs (i.e. `getline` from POSIX 2008) return EOF if the previous call exhausted the stream, not 0.  I get why `try!` makes the situation in Rust unique, but it's really unintuitive to have `read`-esque calls that cannot possibly produce an EOF (why have the concept of EOF at all?).\n\nI think the RFC should be updated.  To meet in the middle (still work with `try!`), perhaps it could return `Ok(())` at the first stream exhaustion and then `Err(EOF)` on all subsequent calls?
