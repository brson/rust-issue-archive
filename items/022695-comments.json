    "body": "Thanks @jamm . We try to keep the bug tracker to 'bugs only', so I'm going to give this a close. This is something that we care about, and we do have plans to make it better. You may want to post this to http://internals.rust-lang.org/ if you'd like to talk about it more :)\n\nThat being said, it's not \"impossible currently to create a standalone binary from a Rust program.\" It's that glibc cannot be statically linked. Everything else can be.\n",
