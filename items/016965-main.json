  "body": "rand: inform the optimiser that indexing is never out-of-bounds.\n\nThis uses a bitwise mask to ensure that there's no bounds checking for\nthe array accesses when generating the next random number. This isn't\ncostless, but the single instruction is nothing compared to the branch.\n\nA `debug_assert` for \"bounds check\" is preserved to ensure that\nrefactoring doesn't accidentally break it (i.e. create values of `cnt`\nthat are out of bounds with the masking causing it to silently wrap-\naround).\n\nBefore:\n\ntest test::rand_isaac   ... bench: 990 ns/iter (+/- 24) = 808 MB/s\ntest test::rand_isaac64 ... bench: 614 ns/iter (+/- 25) = 1302 MB/s\n\nAfter:\n\ntest test::rand_isaac   ... bench: 877 ns/iter (+/- 134) = 912 MB/s\ntest test::rand_isaac64 ... bench: 470 ns/iter (+/- 30) = 1702 MB/s\n\n(It also removes the unsafe code in Isaac64Rng.next_u64, with a _gain_\nin performance; today is a good day.)\n",
