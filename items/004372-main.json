  "body": "This is effectively a modernization of the parsing portion of format string handling (i.e., `core::extfmt::ct`).\n\nIt contains the following changes:\n- The structural record `Conv` is replaced with an otherwise identical `struct Conv`.\n- The structural records returned from the `parse_*` functions are replaced with instances of `struct Parsed<T> { val: T, next: uint }`.\n- All types have a derived `cmp::Eq` implementation to facilitate simpler test code.\n- The `parse_*` and `peek_num` functions are rewritten to remove unnecessary moves and copies and to use simplified logic.\n- `parse_fmt_string` is rewritten to use two byte indices instead of string concatenation to build up each string piece.\n- `parse_type` now correctly handles multibyte characters; although all current types are represented by single-byte characters, this prevents the function from failing through invalid indices passed to `substr` and allows any unknown type specifier character to be printed in its entirety.\n- Most functions now have associated unit tests.\n- The module is formatted more consistently.\n\nNote that all function signatures remain the same _modulo_ the removal of the structural records, so these changes should not affect the code generation or runtime aspects of formatting.\n\nFeedback is welcome.\n",
