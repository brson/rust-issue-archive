I was asking for clarification.\n\nI was trying to clarify first of all that there is _not_ a type or memory safety hole here, see [this comment thread](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/576#discussion-diff-22836724). If you believe this can lead to a type or memory safety violation, can you please spell out the details? (cc @mahkoh)\n\nSecond, I was hoping you could spell out in more concrete detail an exploit based on this behavior alone. It would require a `Reader` implementation to _read_ from the buffer it's supposed to write into, afaict.\n\nAs I said in my comment, we always have the option of zeroing the memory in these convenience methods, which doesn't require any API change.\n",

It will contain whatever was there last \u2014 passwords, encryption keys (yeah, you _should_ zero these on drop, but...), addresses of internal structures useful for defeating ASLR, etc.\n\nYou may not be worried about malicious `read` impls but even an inept one may leak information.  Exploits for systems like kernels or sandboxed browers are very complex.  They often combine information leaks from a number of \"minor\" bugs.\n\n> ... _not_ lead to undefined behavior, at least if we follow a certain pattern of intrinsics use.

But this is a _major_ lurking security risk in a language that otherwise goes out of its way to prevent you from reading uninitialized memory.\n",

    "body": "I'll be honest, I was not following the full details of this discussion before. In particular, I mistakenly thought the focus was on the `read` method, which takes in a buffer and writes into it, rather than the `read_to_end` method. I talked this over a bit with @aturon (and followed @kmcallister's comments on IRC) and my feeling right now is that I agree with @kmcallister, we should uphold the principle that safe APIs do not expose uninitialized bytes. It seems to be a less important guarantee than undefined behavior, but important enough not to sacrifice lightly. Moreover, this problem only even comes up for a narrow range of APIs involving byte buffers; as a consequence those APIs don't feel especially _rusty_ to me. And finally in this particular case, `read_to_end` is merely a convenience function, so if this becomes a perf bottleneck somewhere, it is easily overcome.\n",

    "body": "To me, this hole _does_ constitute a type safety hole.  \"Type safety\" is\nnot just the ability to prevent data structures from being modified outside\nof your language.  It is the ability to preserve the invariants of the\nlanguage.  Put as precisely as I can, \"type safety\" is the property of a\nlanguage, in which the language defines its type system / operations /\ninvariants, and that the language controls the mapping from those language\nsemantics to the underlying machine representation.  That is why, to me,\nbeing able to read the machine state (outside of the language) is just as\nbad as being able to modify the machine state.\n\nI believe many people have the perspective that conserving \"type safety\"\nmeans only preventing modification of machine state outside of language.  I\nthink the last 15 years or so of experience with security, in operating\nsystems, browsers, and everything else, shows that being able to access\ninformation (that you're not supposed to access) can be just as dangerous\nas being able to modify information.\n\nKeegan's point about the composition of large, complex systems is very\nimportant.  Violations of invariants that may seem minor may become major,\nwhen combined with other seemingly-minor exploits, or when an attacker\nmanipulates a \"minor\" exploit (such as reading dirty memory) in order to\nread a very juicy piece of information.\n\nIt is not important that this involves I/O.  What's important is trusted\nsystem code (code within an \"unsafe\" block) is relying on untrusted user\ncode (any implementation of the Reader trait) in order to maintain the\ninvariant of type safety.\n\nIt may be possible to have some cake and eat some.  It may be possible to\nhave Rust provide efficient unsafe implementations of Reader, which cannot\nbe abused by user code (i.e. have no extension points), while at the same\ntime providing less-efficient extensible implementations which guarantee\nthat the buffer is zeroed.\n\nI would be extremely cautious about trading away a profound safety\ninvariant for a small, quantitative gain in performance.\n\nOn Fri, Feb 13, 2015 at 10:18 AM, Keegan McAllister <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> But a read implementation doesn't _read_ from the buffer, it writes into\n> it.
