    "body": "Sadly, at this time Rust only intends to support the subset of emotions that can be derived from [UAX 31](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/), and only then by employing a feature flag. You'll have to put some effort into your emoji, I'm afraid. For example:\n\n``` rust\n#![feature(non_ascii_idents)]\n#![allow(non_snake_case)]  // \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\n\nfn main() {\n    \u0ca0_\u0ca0();\n}\n\nfn \u0ca0_\u0ca0() {\n    println!(\"Hello, \u4e16\u754c\");\n}\n```\n\nPost 1.0 I expect that we can consider expanding the definition of what is permitted within Unicode identifiers, though it would have to proceed through the RFC process.\n",

    "body": "I am of the opinion that this issue should be reopened in light of the RFC being stabilized. As the friendly C++ folks noted on [their report about adopting UAX #31 for C++](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1949r4.html):\r\n\r\n> ### 6.3 Does not allow emoji\r\n> ```cpp\r\n> class \\U0001F4A9 : public std::exception {};\r\n> ```\r\n> Throwing \u201cPILE OF POO\u201d becomes ill-formed. Conference slide-ware will be less entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe same :hankey: emoji is rejected by rust precisely due to UAX-31, and arguably it makes stuff less fun than [what Swift allows](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/LexicalStructure.html#grammar_identifier) :Q (On the other hand, it does render the point about emoji width calculation on the RFC moot!)\r\n",
