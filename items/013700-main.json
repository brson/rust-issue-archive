  "body": "Implements [RFC 7](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/active/0007-regexps.md) and will hopefully resolve #3591. The crate is marked as experimental. It includes a syntax extension for compiling regexps to native Rust code.\n\nEmbeds and passes the `basic`, `nullsubexpr` and `repetition` tests from [Glenn Fowler's (slightly modified by Russ Cox for leftmost-first semantics) testregex test suite](http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/testregex/testregex.html). I've also hand written a plethora of other tests that exercise Unicode support, the parser, public API, etc. Also includes a `regex-dna` benchmark for the shootout.\n\nI know the addition looks huge at first, but consider these things:\n1. More than half the number of lines is dedicated to Unicode character classes.\n2. Of the ~4,500 lines remaining, 1,225 of them are comments.\n3. Another ~800 are tests.\n4. That leaves 2500 lines for the meat. The parser is ~850 of them. The public API, compiler, dynamic VM and code generator (for `regexp!`) make up the rest.\n",
