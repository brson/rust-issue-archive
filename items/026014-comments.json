    "body": "This revision is less precise than the former, since the former tells you two options, and latter just one. Creating `&Trait` is not 'boxing' it, since boxing means moving something onto the heap.\n\nI also don't quite see how this description makes the behavior in your example, where boxing the closure doesn't work, less confusing. If I saw the new message I would probably wrote what you wrote that doesn't work.\n\nSo I think we can probably do better still. r? @steveklabnik \n",

    "body": "So to be clear, the solution I wound up with here was that:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let f = match 1 {\n        1 => Box::new(|c| c + 1),\n        _ => Box::new(|c| c - 1),\n    };\n\n    println!(\"{}\", f(1));\n}\n```\n\nDoesn't work but:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let f: Box<Fn(i32) -> i32> = match 1 {\n        1 => Box::new(|c| c + 1),\n        _ => Box::new(|c| c - 1),\n    };\n\n    println!(\"{}\", f(1));\n}\n```\n\nDoes, eg, it needed to be boxed and coerced to a trait object. It was unclear to me that I could coerce it as a reference, since that would intuitively seem like trying to put DST on the stack.\n",
