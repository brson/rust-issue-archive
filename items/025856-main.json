  "body": "collections: Make BinaryHeap panic safe in sift_up / sift_down\n\nUse a struct called Hole that keeps track of an invalid location\nin the vector and fills the hole on drop.\n\nI include a run-pass test that the current BinaryHeap fails, and the new\none passes.\n\nNOTE: The BinaryHeap will still be inconsistent after a comparison fails. It will\nnot have the heap property. What we fix is just that elements will be valid\nvalues.\n\nThis is actually a performance win -- the new code does not bother to write in `zeroed()`\nvalues in the holes, it just leaves them as they were.\n\nNet result is something like a 5% decrease in runtime for `BinaryHeap::from_vec`. This\ncan be further improved by using unchecked indexing (I confirmed it makes a difference,\nnot a surprise with the non-sequential access going on), but let's leave that for another PR.\nSafety first :wink: \n\nFixes #25842\n",
