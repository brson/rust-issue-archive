    "body": "How about something that's similar to this issue (in that it wraps a reader and modifies its error behaviour) and similar to our old conditions.\n\nHigh-level overview: have errors ignored when they occur, but recorded into an external user-visible handle, and so they can decide to handle errors there.\n\n``` rust\nstruct ErrorHandleInternals { priv error: Option<IoError> }\n\npub struct ErrorHandle { priv inner: *mut ErrorHandleInternals }\nimpl ErrorHandle {\n    /// Retrieve any IO error that has occur before this point on the\n    /// corresponding `ChompingReader`.\n    /// This resets the error state and so an immediate second \n    /// call will return `Ok`.\n    pub fn error(&mut self) -> IoResult<()> {\n        Err(unsafe {(*self.inner).error.take_unwrap()})\n    }\n}\n\npub struct ChompingReader<R> {\n    priv inner: R,\n    priv error_handle: ~ErrorHandleInternals,\n\n    // can't have concurrent access to `error_handle`\n    priv marker: std::kinds::marker::NoSend\n}\n\nimpl ChompingReader<R> {\n    pub fn new(reader: R) -> (ChompingReader<R>, ErrorHandle) { ... }\n}\n\nimpl<R: Reader> Reader for ChompingReader<R> {\n    fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> IoResult<uint> {\n        match self.inner.read(buf) {\n            Ok(x) => Ok(x)\n            Err(e) => {\n                // set an indication that an error happened\n                self.error_handle.error = Some(e)\n                Err(/* substitute an EOF error */)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUsed like\n\n``` rust\nlet (mut reader, mut handle) = ChompingReader::new(my_reader);\n\n// no failure, but errors are recorded, and the loop quits immediately...\nfor line in reader.lines() {\n    foo(line);\n}\n// ... so handling the error here immediately after the loop \n// is pretty similar to handling it manually with .read_line.\nmatch handle.error() {\n    Err(e) => println!(\"error occured in `.lines`)\n    Ok(()) => {}\n}\n```\n\nOn first blush this is a lot of effort to use, and doesn't exactly seem to be worth it for things like `.lines` where `.read_line` in a loop is a perfectly good substitute. (Also, the \"magic\" modifications to `ErrorHandle` would need to be careful to be done correctly, possibly even by storing `*RefCell<>` instead of `*mut`.)\n",

    "body": "If `Lines` stores the error, that makes it a bit awkward to get at.\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut lines = io::stdin().lines();\n    for line in lines {\n        handle_line(line);\n    }\n    match lines.err {\n        Ok(()) => (),\n        Err(e) => handle_error(e)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAdd to that what @huonw suggested, which is that to avoid ignoring the error (which is the root cause of this issue), you'd need a destructor. Besides being ugly, this also has the problem of turning what should be a compile-time lint into an unexpected runtime failure. If I'm going to have runtime failure, I'd rather it just be triggered directly from `lines()` rather than be caused by me omitting error-handling code later.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards saying that `.lines()` should simply `fail!()` on any non-EOF error. Then we can introduce a struct that will convert all errors into EOF, which will allow errors to be ignored by `.lines()`. This has the benefit that this struct can be used elsewhere with APIs that work with Readers when you explicitly don't want to handle errors, for whatever reason. It leaves the basic stdin-processing loop the same as it is today, and the behavior will more closely match scripting languages (which apparently like to raise exceptions in this same situation). The equivalent to handling the exception in the scripting language will be either ignoring errors or switching to explicit calls to `.read_line()`, depending on whether you want to squelch or handle the errors.\n",

But that doesn't mean that we can't keep it pleasant to use.\n\nI posted to the ML that I favored just removing it. However, thinking about it more I think that creating a wrapping iterator that fails on errors might work too. Lets say that we added something like the following to libstd:\n\n``` rust\ntrait IoResultIterator {\n    fn fail_on_error(self) -> FailOnErrorIterator<Self> {\n       FailOnErrorIterator {\n           wrapped: self\n       }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl <T, I: Iterator<IoResult<T>>> IoResultIterator for I {}\n\nstruct FailOnErrorIterator<I> {\n    wrapped: I\n}\n\nimpl <T, I: Iterator<IoResult<T>>> Iterator<T> for FailOnErrorIterator<I> {\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T> {\n       match self.wrapped.next() {\n           Some(x) => match x {\n               Ok(y) => Some(y),\n               Err(io::IoError { kind: io::EndOfFile, .. }) => None,\n               _ => fail!()\n           },\n           None => None\n       }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen, I think the simple \"read lines from STDIN case\" becomes:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    for line in io::stdin().lines().fail_on_error() {\n        print!(\"received: {}\", line);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nwhich is a little bit more verbose than it is now where it ignores errors. However, it doesn't risk surprising anyone with a failure that they didn't expect or force them to check for errors differently with lines() than anywhere else.\n\nEDITED to say that the wrapper fails on errors.\n",
