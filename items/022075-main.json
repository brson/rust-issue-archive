  "body": "Previously, for each arm, each pattern would be visited, then the guard, then the body. All arms would be visited in parallel.\n\nNow, the patterns in each arm are visited in parallel, but after each pattern, the guard is visited. Furthermore, an edge is added from each guard to the next, reflecting the fact that a guard may be evaluated multiple times, and that multiple guards may be evaluated. This required changing dataflow to handle the fact that there is now a 1-many mapping of NodeIds -> CFGIndex.\n\nThis also:\n- Refactors the CFG a little to use explicit node types for entry, exit, dummy and unreachable nodes.\n- Extends the graphviz library to allow for customisation of the graph nodes. This is used for pretty-printing the CFG.\n- Shows the matches when requested item is not unique. Methods on generic types don't seem to be able to be matched, so this just prints out the items that match the suffix provided, which includes the node id.\n\nFixes #22073\n",
