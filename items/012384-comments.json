    "body": "@seanmonstar no, it doesn't address the compilation noise it generates, e.g.\n\n``` rust\nfn foo(x: int) {\n     println!(x); // note: format string literal missing, using default\n     bar(x + 1);\n}\nfn bar(x: int) {\n    println!(x); // note: format string literal missing, using default\n    baz(x + 2);\n}\nfn baz(x: int) {\n    println!(x); // note: format string literal missing, using default\n    // ...\n}\nfn main() { foo(0) }\n```\n\nEverything single one of those `println!`s gets a note, so that's 9+ lines (including the source output and the `^~~~` span) of _unsilenceable_ compiler output, always, making it harder to interpret any other output. And making it especially hard when there are some legitimate `println!(x)`'s and some others that are meant to be formatted but are accidentally of this form, e.g.\n\n``` rust\nprintln!(some_variable); // ok, omitted format string on purpose\n\nprintln!(&mut writer, \"a {} b\", 1); // oops, was meant to be `writeln!`\n```\n\nIn any case, I think this shouldn't be done via `println!`. Something like `debug_dump!(x, y, ..., z)` seems like it would be better: it makes it clearer that it's for debugging only, and doesn't require the compiler to print things to stop people accidentally doing something wrong.\n",

    "body": "I actually disagree on each point.\n\nComing from other languages like Java or JavaScript, something like println is sometimes use to output information to a user, such as for command line scripts, but almost seems more likely to just be quick debug lines. I pointed at past work with `console.log` as an example.\n\nUsing another macro to do the same thing, but to have a different name, seems less elegant. Java has seared into my mind that `System.out.println()` is a debug message more often than not.\n\nAs for the note at each usage, that seems quite fine to me. The extra noise can help you to remember to remove it after it's no longer needed. Plus, I'd expect an ability to eventually ignore note level messages from the compiler, such as `rustc --level=warn mod.rs`. Again, sort of how you can receive or ignore notices and warnings in Java, PHP, ActionScript, etc.\n\nHowever, being the newcomer, I'll concede to not knowing what's best for Rust. Cheers.\n",
