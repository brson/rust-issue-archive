It makes code that should be straightforward even more annoying if you want to re-use the coerced object in multiple places by pulling it into a variable:\n\n``` rust\n// Where OutputWriter is a struct and OutputStream is a trait it implements\nlet mut writer = OutputWriter::new(counter.bytecount);\nlet &mut writer_stream = &mut writer as &mut OutputStream;\n\ndo_something_with_writer_stream(writer_stream);\n\n// Calling writer.bytes() moves the original writer out, so\n// the compiler complains because there is still a mutable loan outstanding.\nwriter.bytes();\n```\n",
