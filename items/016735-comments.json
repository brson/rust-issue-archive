    "body": "Seems maybe a bit odd for the results to change dramatically going from \"rea\" to \"read\". I don't really know though. Maybe it's ok.\n\nWhat I'd really like to see is simply more intelligent searching. If I search for \"ptr::re\" I get lots of results that don't even have \"ptr\" in the name. My personal expectation of how the search should work is basically finding all results that match case-insensitively if you turn the search string into a glob pattern by inserting a `*` between every character. It would still want to do relevance ordering, e.g. characters that are actually next to each other in the result are a better match than others, e.g. \"ptr\" matches \"ptr\" better than \"pointer\". And it would also still want to do some sort of edit distance fuzzy matching too, to account for typos.\n\nSearch is a hard problem.\n",

For ambiguous searches there's some pretty big shifts, but it's not clear if the results are better or worse as a result.\n\nI think the strongest thing I can say about this functionality is that it visually smooths out the search results, making them easier to parse, in my subjective opinion. I'm overall positive on the feature, it's just that the gains are just very marginal if real at all. That said, it's a small, easily-reversible, addition to what is already an abomination of a function.\n\nThankfully it's not my call :sweat_smile: \n",

Please feel free to reach out to any of the Rust developers on IRC if you're not hearing back.\n\nSecond, I want to thank you for making the PR in the first place.\n\nAll that said, I think I'm going to close this PR for now. While I agree that our current sorting is not ideal, I don't think this is a clear enough improvement to warrant the churn. I think @kballard made some good suggestions about a deeper change here that might be worth pursuing.\n\nFinally, don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like guidance on contributions!\n",
