  "body": "This adds a struct which runs a block when it falls out of scope,\nsimilar to `scope` in D or `defer` in Go. Using this module directly\nrequires code to assign the ScopeGuard struct to a variable manually\nwhich is unnecessary in many situations.\n\nIt'd be nice to add a syntax extension to automatically expand\n\n``` rust\nscope!(success) {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nto something like\n\n``` rust\nlet __scope__<FILE>_<LINE>_<COL> = ::std::scope::guard(::std::scope::Success, { ... });\n```\n\nbut I don't think that syntax extensions can currently expand to statements as opposed to expressions or items and I'm not familiar enough with libsyntax to add it easily. I put this in libstd instead of libextra since it'll need to be there for the syntax extension to work reasonably.\n\ncc #9835\n",
