  "body": "In two ways:\n- for a plain `fail!(a)` we make the generic part of `begin_unwind` as small as possible (makes `fn main() { fail!() }` compile 2-3x faster, due to less monomorphisation bloat)\n- for `fail!(\"format {}\", \"string\")`, we avoid touching the generics completely by doing the formatting in a specialised function, which (with optimisations) saves a function call at the call-site of `fail!`. (This one has significantly less benefit than the first.)\n",
