(YMMV of course, as this is a case where we can argue either way.)\n\n(Also, if we rename them to `ptr::copy_ft` etc, people may ask, why `copy` in `std::io` is not `copy_ft`? Surely they have the same argument order?)\n\nSo maybe renaming won't be a worthy improvement, as long as people are aware of Rust's rule: `src` always comes first.\n",

It could definitely be confusing if you switched between the two, but in my head, an intrinsic says \"I don't control what this function looks like, I just link to it\".\n\nThat said, it would really only make sense if `std::intrinsics` had a \"specifically LLVM intrinsics\" section, and wasn't all viewed as \"rustc intrinsics\". In that case, I'd probably also be in favor of renaming them to match their LLVM counterparts.\n",

    "body": "Cross-posted [from reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/31p33q/memcpy_is_backwards/cq473xk):\n\n# \n\nIt was absolutely a mistake to push the ordering change through without an RFC, and I apologize for signing off on it. It wound up causing some painful fallout, and it's clear that many have strong opinions about the order here that weren't taken into account. Of course, this kind of thing won't happen in the future, since we won't be able to make changes to stable APIs.\n\nThe main question now is whether, and how, we should reverse this change. I'm going to suggest that discussion on the next step happen in the [ongoing discuss thread](http://internals.rust-lang.org/t/memcpy-is-backwards/1797/), where there are already a number of interesting suggestions. Let's try to reach a consensus there before taking action.\n\n# \n\nAs such, I'm going to close this PR _for now_, to try to move discussion to a central place and come to a decision before taking an action like this one.\n",
