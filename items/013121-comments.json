    "body": "Something that came up in an [IRC discussion](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust/2014-06-17/?msg=16392683&page=7) (which botbot.me unfortunately failed to capture completely): when the last field of a struct is unsized, is it always supposed to be one of the type parameters to the struct, as is shown in the examples on [niko's blog](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2014/01/05/dst-take-5/)?  Or is one allowed to have an unsized field where the struct could never be instantiated to a sized version of itself?\n\nI.e. compare these two variants:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo<Sized? T> { x: int, d: T }\nstruct Bar{ x: int, d: [int] }\n```\n\nI assume the way one would create an instance of the latter, if it is allowed at all, would be via `transmute`, as some level, even if only e.g. within the Allocator.\n\n(update: deleted bogus example that tried to have unsized local variables.  And it also tried to transmute a `Foo` to a `Bar`, which seemed sane (though incorrect in the end) when they were unsized locals, but became insane when I turned them into `&Foo` and `&Bar`.)\n\n---\n\nOr perhaps it would be legal to do `let b : &Bar = &Bar { x: 0, d: [1,2,3] as [int] };` ?\n",
