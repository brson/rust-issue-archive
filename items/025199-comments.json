If that's the issue, it feels like this problem should be resolvable by always treating boxed trait objects as have an explicit `Drop` implementation in `dropck`.  You might be able to improve that to only `Sized` types, I can't remember whether unsized types can have custom destructors.\n",

    "body": "Actually... now that I think about it, it may be a different problem: it seems like `dropck` isn't treating `Box<Foo+'a>` as having the same lifetime as `'a`.  To expand on what I mean, the code below issues a compiler error correctly:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\n\nstruct VecHolder {\n    v: Vec<u32>,\n}\n\nimpl Drop for VecHolder {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        println!(\"Dropping Vec\");\n    }\n}\n\ntrait Foo {}\n\nimpl<'a> Foo for Test<'a> {}\n\nstruct Container<'a> {\n    v: VecHolder,\n    d: RefCell<Vec<Box<Foo + 'a>>>,\n}\n\nimpl<'a> Container<'a> {\n    fn new() -> Container<'a> {\n        Container{d: RefCell::new(Vec::new()), v: VecHolder{v: vec![42; 100]}}\n    }\n\n    fn store(&'a self, val: Box<Foo + 'a>) {\n        self.d.borrow_mut().push(val);\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Test<'a> {\n    test: &'a Container<'a>,\n}\n\nimpl<'a> Drop for Test<'a> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        println!(\"Val from Vec: {}\", self.test.v.v[30]);\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let (container, test);\n    container = Container::new();\n    test = Test{test: &container};\n    container.store(Box::new(test) as Box<Foo>);\n}\n```\n\nThe problem appears to be occuring because we don't actually have to write it like this (rooting things that reference each other in the same let binding) for `Box<Trait>`, while we do in most (hopefully all) other cyclic situations (e.g. if you change it to `&'a Foo` instead of `Box<Foo + 'a>`, rustc won't let you get away with this).  So I think it may just be a missed case in the implementation, rather than a conceptual issue... perhaps something subtle like not accounting for the fact that `Box` has special move semantics?\n",
