I don't _expect_ that to be the case. It would probably also be very poor design if `T::clone()` had different behavior from a copy when `T: Copy`.

    "body": "It might be worth observing that in this case, in a sense, the compiler is being over-conservative: it would actually be OK to allow all of `impl<T: Copy> Clone for T`, `impl<T: Copy> Copy for Option<T>`, and `impl<T: Clone> Clone for Option<T>` (with the obvious definitions) at the same time, the compiler just doesn't (and probably can't) know that. These definitions are confluent. No matter how you derive a `Clone` impl for `Option<T>` (given `T: Copy`), the result will be the same. If you go through the first `impl`, it will `Copy` the whole `Option` as-is; with the third `impl`, it will go variant-wise and `Copy` the contained value. But it doesn't make any difference in the end, and so doesn't _actually_ violate coherence. (Likewise for the other analogous cases, e.g. tuples.) \n\nA much harder question is whether this insight can be useful in any way. In a dependently typed language, _maybe_ the compiler could reason about the definitions of the `impl`s, prove confluence, and so accept them. But definitely not in Rust. Possibly we could shift the proof burden onto the programmer, and allow her to say, \"These definitions are confluent. Believe me.\". But how, and where? Which `impl` (or perhaps `trait`?) do you attach an annotation to, and with what content? These `impl`s aren't supposed to \"know about\" each other, and it would feel kind of hackish and improper for them to somehow refer to each other directly when stating confluence.\n\n(GHC's type-level functions (`type family`s, a.k.a. associated types) have this no-overlap-except-if-confluent rule, but being at the type level, GHC gets to check whether the property holds directly.)\n",
