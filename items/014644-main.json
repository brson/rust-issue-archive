  "body": "A few notable improvements were implemented to cut down on the number of aborts\ntriggered by the standard library when a local task is not found.\n- Primarily, the unwinding functionality was restructured to support an unsafe\n  top-level function, `try`. This function invokes a closure, capturing any\n  failure which occurs inside of it. The purpose of this function is to be as\n  lightweight of a \"try block\" as possible for rust, intended for use when the\n  runtime is difficult to set up.\n  \n  This function is _not_ meant to be used by normal rust code, nor should it be\n  consider for use with normal rust code.\n- When invoking spawn(), a `fail!()` is triggered rather than an abort.\n- When invoking LocalIo::borrow(), which is transitively called by all I/O\n  constructors, None is returned rather than aborting to indicate that there is\n  no local I/O implementation.\n\nA test case was also added showing the variety of things that you can do without\na runtime or task set up now. In general, this is just a refactoring to abort\nless quickly in the standard library when a local task is not found.\n",
