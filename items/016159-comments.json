    "body": "Please forgive me for any ignorance that follows from me, I have only recently started reading about Rust.\n\nWould it be possible for the compiler to instantiate generics in a two-stage process, i.e.: suppose I have two Rust crates, `lgpl` and `bsd`. I would like `bsd` to utilize `lgpl` but not to incorporate any generics or inlined code, to make sure the `libbsd` binary is distributable under BSD license when dynamically linked with `liblgpl`.\n\nCould the Rust compiler instantiate generics in a third, dynamically created crate, or dynamically modify `liblgpl` to instantiate the generics I export, producing a new `liblgpl`?\n\nSo the resulting hierarchy would be:\n\n`libbsd` depends on `liblgpl` and `liblgpl-generics`\n`liblgpl-generics` is the result of using metadata from my library and `liblgpl` to instantiate any generics, and depends on `liblgpl`.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n",

    "body": "Another thought that occurs to me is to utilize the very-late-binding approach that LLVM offers on some platforms to perform whole program optimization. If it was possible to realize generics as LLVM bitcode<sup>1</sup> and compile to a static binary at installation time, you could work around library issues. The resulting binary would be generated on the end-user's machine. Rust would have to use something along the lines of LLVM's [link time optimization](http://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html) model. \n\nThe benefit of this is that all installed libraries would be statically compiled, and I suspect link-time/whole program optimization is something that will concern Rust developers in the future _anyhow_. But is that an endeavor worth pursuing now? I am too ignorant to say.\n\n<sup>1</sup> - The immediate issue though is whether or not LLVM bitcode is an attractive target for generics to hit. My guess is that it would take substantial work to allow libraries to be compiled with generic metadata written in terms of LLVM bitcode, and it would take work on the linker side to then utilize that knowledge in linking libraries at installation time.\n",
