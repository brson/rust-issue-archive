    "body": "There's a general problem of balancing allocation and convenience. AFAIK we're leaning towards \"don't allocate if you don't have to\". And maybe there's a usecase for that, but I'm not sure that usecase is in path handling. Then again, whoever _does_ care about it is going to be really annoyed that simple path operations are allocating all over the place.\n\ncc @aturon @kballard @alexcrichton \n",

I wrote the current incarnation of the Path module, and I'll readily admit that most uses of paths don't really care much about allocation, but the problem is that this is such an important module (being the fundamental representation of paths for all path-related APIs) that if it doesn't allow you to avoid allocation then it will be very problematic for the small number of people that genuinely do care about path allocation.\n",
