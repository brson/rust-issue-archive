Maybe we can add some similar string.\n\nIn other news, I now _hate_ `// NOTE` despite advocating for it originally. It seems to be used exclusively to remind us (incessantly) that there is something that should be adjusted upon snapshot; usually though such cases are marked with `#[cfg(stage0)]` anyhow, and a comment that we can grep for when we do a snapshot would be sufficient.\n",
