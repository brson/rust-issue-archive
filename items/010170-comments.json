I don't have the background to know precisely why it's done this way.\n",

    "body": "I imagine it's nice that destructors run at the end of a block when you have some kind of token that you want to hold for some time. E.g.\n\n``` rust\nfn doSomething(LockableThing L) {\n  let lock_token = L.getLock();\n  doStuffWithLAssumingWeHaveTheLock();\n  // lock_token goes out of scope here and unlocks L\n}\n```\n\nIf you want your specific example to run you can assign to _:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Master;\n\nstruct Child<'self>\n{\n  master: &'self mut Master\n}\n\nfn main(){\n  let mut m=Master;\n  let _=Child{master: &mut m};\n  let _=Child{master: &mut m};\n}\n```\n\nStrangely, putting a `let _ = c1` between the assignments of c1 and c2 does not appear to work (bug?).\n",
