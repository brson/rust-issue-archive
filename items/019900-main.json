  "body": "This commit shuffles around some CLI flags of the compiler to some more stable\nlocations with some renamings. The changes made were:\n- The `-v` flag has been repurposes as the \"verbose\" flag. The version flag has\n  been renamed to `-V`.\n- The `-h` screen has been split into two parts. Most top-level options (not\n  all) show with `-h`, and the remaining options (generally obscure) can be\n  shown with `--help -v` which is a \"verbose help screen\"\n- The `-V` flag (version flag now) has lost its argument as it is now requested\n  with `rustc -vV` \"verbose version\".\n- The `--emit` option has had its `ir` and `bc` variants renamed to `llvm-ir`\n  and `llvm-bc` to emphasize that they are LLVM's IR/bytecode.\n- The `--emit` option has grown a new variant, `dep-info`, which subsumes the\n  `--dep-info` CLI argument. The `--dep-info` flag is now deprecated.\n- The `--parse-only`, `--no-trans`, `--no-analysis`, and `--pretty` flags have\n  moved behind the `-Z` family of flags.\n- The `--debuginfo` and `--opt-level` flags were moved behind the top-level `-C`\n  flag.\n- The `--print-file-name` and `--print-crate-name` flags were moved behind one\n  global `--print` flag which now accepts one of `crate-name`, `file-names`, or\n  `sysroot`. This global `--print` flag is intended to serve as a mechanism for\n  learning various metadata about the compiler itself.\n- The top-level `--pretty` flag was moved to a number of `-Z` options.\n\nNo warnings are currently enabled to allow tools like Cargo to have time to\nmigrate to the new flags before spraying warnings to all users.\n\ncc https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/19051\n",
