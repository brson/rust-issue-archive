    "body": "One thing we have to be careful of: multiple memory pools and arenas can share the same `'pool` lifetime with this API. This means that a \"free()\" call might get an arena allocation from a different memory pool instead of this one. This could be dangerous. We could address this with a dynamic check (annoying) or by refactoring the API so that one creates and works with an arena like so:\n\n```\nstruct MemoryPool { ... } // this is private and becomes an implementation detail\n\nimpl Arena {\n    fn init() -> Arena { ... } // this is private!\n\n    pub fn with<A, R>(a: A, f: <'a> |&'a mut Arena<'a>, A| -> R) -> R {\n        let mut pool = MemoryPool::init();\n        let mut arena = Arena::init(&mut pool);\n        f(&mut arena, a)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis has the advantage of hiding the memory pool and being more compatible with the `Message` API that I proposed. I passed an extra `A` argument so as to permit moves into the closure, since this is effectively a once fn.\n",
