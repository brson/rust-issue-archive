    "body": "If we just relax the bootstrap key a little, and make it a statically-known value instead of a \"secret\", then there would be no need for wrapper scripts.  The build system could just export that value applicable to stage0 invocations too.\n\nAs the configure script says itself, that secret is just meant to be a mild deterrent.  By default it's only a `%H:%M:%S` timestamp -- that's easily grepped from `strings librustc-*.so` for a determined user.  I think it would still be a good enough deterrent to be something fixed like \"unsupported-rustc-bootstrap-mode\".  (Now that I say it, I guess each distro could choose their own fixed `CFG_BOOTSTRAP_KEY` already.)\n\nA statically-known bootstrap key is not that different from an unlocked `rustc_driver`, deterrent-wise.\n\nAside, it might be nice if the resulting `UnstableFeatures` value showed up in debuginfo somewhere, perhaps in `DW_AT_producer`.\n",
