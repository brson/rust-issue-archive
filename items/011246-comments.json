    "body": "@alexcrichton: It doesn't mark all provided methods as live. It only marks a provided method as live if the method is used in the first place. For example, if we have `foo.bar()`, `bar` is statically resolved, and `bar` is a non-provided method, then the behavior is exactly the same as before. If `bar` is a provided method, then we look at the actual source (currently the dead-code pass would look at the dummy def id instead).\n\nOn the other hand, if `bar` is invoked on type parameters or trait instance, then we look at the original trait method definition (which may turn out to be a provided method).\n\nPerhaps my commit message ought to be more descriptive. :P\n",
