It only makes sense when `b` is already ASCII lower-case itself. It\u2019s typically used with a literal string for `b`. I\u2019d like it to also check that `b` is indeed lower case, but only when testing/debugging. I previously had something guarded by `#[cfg(test)]` but this indicates whether libstd is being tested, while I want to check if the user\u2019s program is being tested.

    "body": "About naming/unification: The `Ascii` and `AsciiStr` traits are supposed to contain ASCII data only, as indicated by `assert!(self.is_ascii());` thorough the code. This is different: it needs to operate on full Unicode `&str` strings that can contain non-ASCII characters (which are just unchanged.)\n\nStill, please indicate the naming / kind of interface that you prefer and I can update this pull request.\n\nAbout implementation: Yes, case in the ASCII range is a single bit. These function can be implemented in at least two ways: with a lookup in a 256-byte vector, or with a bit flip conditioned by two comparisons. I don\u2019t really know which is faster or otherwise better, but I went with the former as it seems to be what CPython and my system\u2019s libc are doing. I could change `Ascii.to_upper` and `Ascii.to_lower` to match.\n",

    "body": "Sure, not talking about converting it to `Ascii`, just using a common naming scheme.\nFor example `eq_ignore_case()` for Ascii and `ascii_eq_ignore_case()` as extension method on `&str`, rather than `ascii_ieq()` for the latter. (On a shorter name if you can find one.)\n\nAll the `Ascii` type does is encapsulate the invariant that it is a `u8` with the highest bit always unset (== 7 bit data), you can convert between that and `u8` with casting where appropiate.\n\nNo idea which one is faster, so maybe just use the bitflip one because it is shorter?\n",
