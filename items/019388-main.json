  "body": "r? @huonw or @alexcrichton\n\nApparently, we have previously rejected an RFC like this. However, since then we removed `{:?}` and so without this debugging gets really difficult as soon as there is a RefCell anywhere, so I believe there is more benefit to adding these impls than there was before. By using \"try_borrow\" we can avoid panicing in `Show` (I think).\n\n@ huon in response to a comment in #19254: I noticed that `drop()` checks for the ptr being null, so I checked here too. Now I am checking for both, if you're confident I can change to only checking `strong()`.\n",
