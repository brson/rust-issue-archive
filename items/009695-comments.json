It just seems very surprising to me that a user could have control over my RNGs like that (e.g. if my program is a game, a user could exploit this to try and make it predictable in order to cheat, by replaying the game with the same seed). Seems to me like something that should be opt-in.\n",

    "body": "Overall, this is a very well done, patch, nice job!\n\nI left a bunch of comments and suggestions lying around, although another one that I thought of after reading is whether we should have `new` by default read from an OS source to seed a new random number generator. On one hand, it's nice to be \"more secure by default\", but on the other hand it's also not really expected that creating a random number generator could fail because you're out of file descriptors.\n\nI would personally be more in favor of explicit seeding from a source I provide rather than you assuming that the seeding source should be `OSRng` whenever I call `new`. This is possible with some static methods on traits, but I still feel that `new` by default shouldn't use the OS seed. Do others have thoughts on this?\n",

(I was/am even going to implement `Default` for the various RNG types.)\n- `new` reading from the OS seems perfectly reasonable to me: just like `HashMap::new` uses the task-local RNG. If someone _really_ needs to avoid the cost & risk of failure, they can seed it themselves. (If we are finding this is a common problem, it is clearly reasonable to revisit this decision.)\n",
