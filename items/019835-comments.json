    "body": "@thestinger The problem is that I'm not even sure it's useful for that (or at least, notably more useful than Monotonic).  From the LLVM atomics documentation on Monotonic:\n\n> In terms of the optimizer, this can be treated as a read+write on the relevant memory location (and alias analysis will take advantage of that). In addition, **it is legal to reorder non-atomic and Unordered loads around Monotonic loads.** CSE/DSE and a few other optimizations are allowed, but Monotonic operations are unlikely to be used in ways which would make those optimizations useful.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> **Code generation is essentially the same as that for unordered for loads and stores.** No fences are required. cmpxchg and atomicrmw are required to appear as a single operation.\n\nSimilar documentation elsewhere in LLVM suggests that unordered loads can also probably be reordered around everything else, with the possible exception of explicit fences (and it's not even completely clear to me that unordered loads and stores respect those).  So I am not sure whether it really buys us anything over `Relaxed`--it seems like it's basically got incorrect semantics for anything useful if you actually _are_ sharing memory, and only exists because it would prohibit a lot of optimizations if Java used Monotonic everywhere.\n",

In practice I suspect a monotonic load will have exactly the same codegen there (up to operation reordering that you likely don't want), plus saner behavior overall (and if you want more specific fast behavior on particular architectures you probably have to drop into assembly anyway).  So really the _only_ usecase I see is implementing something like a JVM bytecode interpreter, where you'll have non-Rust code running in a language that can't enforce Rust's no data race guarantee.  TBH, I don't know if that's a useful enough case.  If you don't think so, feel free to close this.\n",
