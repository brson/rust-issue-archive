    "body": "@pnkfelix Oh, I didn't know it had already been removed.  Then these statements should at least be updated accordingly:\n\n> The `!` annotation does not denote a type. Rather, the result type of a diverging function is a special type called `$\\bot$` (\"bottom\") that unifies with any type. Rust has no syntax for `$\\bot$`.\n- http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#diverging-functions\n\nThe way I understood your explanation is: \"diverging-ness\" of a function is specific to each function marked with `-> !`.  That's fine with me (as long as it's clearly explained so in the language reference and we don't call it the \"bottom type\".)\n\nBut then, I think `f()` in the second example should be rejected by type check because a type variable `R` remains undetermined.\n",
