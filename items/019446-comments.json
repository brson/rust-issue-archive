    "body": "I think it is totally reasonable for `==` to use interior mutability in a way that doesn't change semantics.  Some data structures rebalance on every traversal.  It would be great to _prove_ that the semantics aren't changed, but this is far outside the scope of Rust's type system.\n\nI think the lint is a good idea though, because there's no need to call `x == y;` _only_ for the side effects.  If you really need it, say in your test cases for `Eq`, then `let _ = x == y;` is the solution.\n",
