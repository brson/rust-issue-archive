    "body": "It sounds like it might be worth going through the stdlib and converting `fail!()`-ing constructors (and other functions) to ones returning `Option`s or `Result`s where reasonable, since the stdlib will set the tone for other libraries.\n\nI agree with @glehel that Rust seems to be far too free with using `.get()`/`.unwrap()`... even `.expect(\"<some useful message>\")` is better since it makes it (1) obvious that the author has thought a little about the failing case, and (2) gives a slightly useful error message, rather than just `called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value`, which is pathetically useless, and requires diving into GDB to work out exactly where it happened.\n\nAs a point against this in Rust, we don't have the functors/applicatives/`do`-sugar that Haskell has that makes working with these nicer.\n",
