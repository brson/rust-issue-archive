    "body": "This feature is fully usable today, I don't think there's any additional compiler support required. It's feature gated so there's no harm in having it available for use with the libgcc_s (libquadmath) f128 support. It's a feature offered by Clang, GCC, ICC and MSVC and works fine with all of them out-of-the-box. The support is compiler-rt is maturing, and it now supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and has an initial (but buggy) comparison implementation. It will soon have full support for the required operations on 64-bit without needing libgcc_s.\n\nhttp://reviews.llvm.org/rL211312\nhttp://reviews.llvm.org/rL211313\n\nAFAIK, this is exactly what feature gates are for and there's hardly any cost to supporting an extra floating point case in the compiler. I don't buy the argument that it's somehow detrimental to the long-term development, it's just a few lines where there's code handling f32 and f64.\n",

    "body": "@kballard: The compiler already has full support for this. I didn't add support for passing it to foreign functions, but that's really easy to do. Can anyone point out what support is actually missing for this, and exactly what doesn't already work?\n\n@brson: The reasoning has not been spelled out. The meeting notes only contain inaccuracies, and the real reason is an arbitrary political choice. It's not different than deciding to reject a pull request implementing tail call elimination support **behind a feature gate**. The claim that a few dozen lines of code following the same pattern as `f32` and `f64` is \"detrimental to the long-term development of the compiler\" is laughable.\n\nA highly controversial, immature feature without a clearly laid out design like `struct` inheritance is totally fine. A fully working implementation of a primitive type offered by other compilers (GCC, Clang, ICC, MSVC) is not. It's purely a political decision and was never discussed on the issue tracker or mailing list where an objection could have been raised.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger, isn't the whole point of the RFC process to discuss these things through the RFC process rather than the issue tracker?\n\nAnyways, it seems that the non-Apple AArch64 LLVM backend does now include `f128` support, although the Apple one does not (`long double` is parsed by Clang, but just gets treated like `double`). The ARM backend does not support `f128` at all. There is PPC support for a _different_ 128-bit floating-point type, special-cased as `ppc_f128` in the LLVM type system, but it isn't actually IEEE quadruple precision; it is represented as a sum of two 64-bit floating-point values.\n",

    "body": "@sinistersnare: A program using `f128` compiles with `rustc` and works correctly as long as you avoid the buggy compiler-rt comparison functions by removing them from the archive. You don't need a source to run a `rustc` command and verify that stuff like this works fine:\n\n``` rust\n#![feature(quad_precision_float)]\n\nfn main() {\n    let x: f128 = 5.5;\n    let y = x * 2.0 - 10.0;\n    println!(\"{}\", y as f64)\n}\n```\n\nThe library support wasn't written yet, so you can't pass it to `println!`, but it would have been easy to implement that. The extraordinary claims are the ones stating that what you can clearly verify yourself with `rustc` _does not work_. It's also quite extraordinary to claim that the tiny amount of code necessary to support this is a burden holding back the long-term development of the compiler.\n",

The support in both compiler-rt and LLVM is being worked on.\n\n@sinistersnare: You can verify that it's implemented in those compilers with a quick search.\n\nThere's also a `numpy.float128` class used in numpy/scipy for extended precision calculations without the overhead of arbitrary precision floating point types.\n",

The removal seems odd to me as well given 1) it's a tiny amount of code 2) it's hard to imagine a future where Rust would not at some point gain f128 support.\n",
