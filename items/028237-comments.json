If I didn't cast when creating the range `for i in 0..(len as usize)`, then I'd have to use `i as usize` half a dozen times inside the loop anyway.\n\nSince this syntax is still feature-gated I hope the ship hasn't sailed.\n",

The discussion covered many of the points people are raising here: alternative syntax (including no new syntax), the contrast with Ruby's similar operators, etc.\n\nIf you feel strongly that the feature should be different, I think you need to take it through the same RFC process, because that's how changes to the language get made.

There was a general sense of unhappiness with this feature -- we considered moving to deprecate, but decided to hold off on that for the time being. There are two major objections to `...` as it stands:\n- the ease of confusion between `..` and `...`;\n- @aturon has been thinking that it would be better to have a more \"fully capable\" range syntax -- this could also be used in APIs like btree iteration and so forth.\n\n**To that end, we were wondering if someone would be willing to drive forward an RFC that enabled a more general syntax like that let people specify precisely whether the lower- and upper-bounds would be inclusive or exclusive.** I think @aturon would be happy to work with someone on such an RFC. \n",

In particular, I think that `...` is suboptimal, but if we move to `..=` or something more explicit, it probably doesn't really hurt to do something a bit more general, even if it's rarely used. That is, if we make it systematic, it doesn't seem much harder to learn, and it's surely the case that there would be no confusion as to whether `..` or `...` means \"more numbers\".\n",

    "body": "@adelarsq: In Rust we don't need ranges that don't include the start. But the bracket syntax only makes sense when those are allowed. Plus, bracket syntax is already used.\r\n\r\nI think `..=` is the most reasonable choice for inclusive ranges. \r\nEasy to visually distinguish from `..`, which `...` is not. The chance of typing `...` when meaning `..` or vice versa and not noticing is higher than with `..=`. \r\n(It's comparable to accidentally typing `if(a = b)` instead of `if(a == b)` in C, both in visual noticeability and bug potential).\r\nAnd `..=` is easy to memorize because it's symbolic for it's meaning (`i ..= j` means the range `i .. j` and where `i = j`).",

    "body": "I just noticed something:\r\n\r\nIn mathematics you could write `\u2200 i: 0 \u2264 i < 10` which would translate into\r\n```Rust\r\nfor i in 0 ..< 10 { }\r\n```\r\nThis is consistent.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statement `\u2200 i: 0 \u2264 i \u2264 10` would translate into\r\n```Rust\r\nfor i in 0 ..= 10 { }\r\n```\r\nHere, \u2264 translates to =, which feels inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThis might be bikeshedding, but\r\n```Rust\r\nfor x in 0 ..<= 10 { }\r\n```\r\nfeels more correct. This may be due to my C background where\r\n```C\r\nfor (unsigned int i = 0; i <= 10; ++i) { }\r\n```\r\ntranslates into \"as long as `i` is smaller or equal to `10` do something\". In C I prefer not to use `==` in loop conditions, because of the possibility to jump over the value and end up in an infinite loop. This can not happen in Rust, but translating `for i in 1 ..= 10` to C might suggest exactly that.\r\n\r\nTaking it further,\r\n```Rust\r\nfor i in 0 <..<= 10 { }\r\n```\r\nwould be self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nEdit: here was a bad reverse example meant to show how using only `=` might be confusing. Deleted, since it was more confusing than constructive.",

    "body": "@duesee How is `>=..>` self-explanatory? Shouldn't it be `<=..>` (<= 10 and > 0) ?\r\nIMO it's not self-explanatory, it's cryptic and too long as an operator.\r\n(No operator should be longer than 3 chars IMO).\r\nBtw, we already have a way to express reverse iteration direction: `.rev()`\r\nWe only need operators for inclusive ranges and maybe `.step_by()`.\r\nFor the step the syntax could be `a .. b | s` (and for inclusive ranges: `a ..= b | s`).\r\n\r\n@norru: Your example `for i in (1..l.len()).rev() { ... }` is very unrealistic, as most of the time you would use slices (`for x in arr[1..].rev() { ... }`), but even if you are forced to use the index-style of iteration (basically only when you modify array elements that are not at `i`), I don't find it hard to read at all. (But I usually leave spaces around `..` when the args are not literal numbers: `(1 .. arr.len()).rev()`)",

    "body": "I can't get behind `..^`.\r\n\r\nOn a personal level, I find it very ugly (partly because the `..` is so vertically disjoint from the `^` in many fonts).\r\n\r\nAs a UI/UX guy, I think it's an example of being too clever for your own good.\r\n\r\nIf I come in from another language and see `..^`, I may not even recognize it as a range (for all I know, `5..^15` could be some weird partial factorial shorthand for `15! - 4!`) because humans think in contexts and the only association that character has in a mainstream programming context is exponentiation.\r\n\r\n(If we didn't think in contexts, `...` could mean something like \"callback gets inserted here\" or \"emit event\" by analogy to its \"content omitted\"-like meaning in dialogue in prose writing, just to show the most immediate example. Giving it a  \"goes all the way up\" meaning via its resemblance to an arrow is like doing magic tricks via sleight of hand, as far as how it interacts with a newcomer's expectations.)\r\n\r\nBy contrast, `=` has precedent for referring to both the action of assignment and the concept of equality and there's no \"weird exponentiation syntax\"-like misconception for `..=` because the closest you can get to \"assignment + equality\" that isn't already handled by the assignment operator is \"something to do with a sequence of numbers, ending on the right-hand one\"... which is a vague but appropriate definition of what range syntax does.\r\n\r\nI also worry that, even if I did recognize that `..^` was range syntax from its use in context, I'd have no intuitive idea whether it was inclusive or exclusive at first, because there's no meaning for the `^` in the relevant context, except for the possibility that `2..^8` is shorthand for an open-ended range starting at two and stepping by taking the previous step to the power of 8. (ie. `2..Inf^8` as opposed to `2..+8` being shorthand for \"iterate from 2 to infinity in steps of 8\".)\r\n\r\nThat problem is also avoided by `..=` because people are used to thinking in terms of `<` (exclusive) vs. `<=` (inclusive) when writing `while` loops and C-style `for` loops.",

    "body": "> I hate to even mention it because it's just more noise, but what about .: (dot colon) for inclusive?\r\n\r\nI think @ssokolow made some great points re: UI/being clever. I'd argue that switching the direction of the third dot for the sake of tricking your eyes into seeing something else would probably be in that category.\r\n\r\nI personally have _zero_ objection to there being a third dot, other than knowing it's bound to trip some people up eventually. But it's also dead easy to explain, so I'm not sure the onus should be on the language to design clever workarounds.  Is '2 dots exclusive; 3 dots inclusive' really _that_ hard to grasp/debug?\r\n\r\nIn any case - who makes the final decision, and what's the next step to closing this off? 18 months discussing the third character probably _is_ bikeshedding at this point \ud83d\ude04 ",

    "body": "So, I'm sorry to say, but when we discussed this issue in the @rust-lang/lang meeting, we failed to reach a consensus. @withoutboats in particular has some severe reservations that hopefully they can air for themselves.\r\n\r\nSome major points that we discussed:\r\n\r\n- If we have an inclusive range syntax in expressions and patterns, it ought to be the same\r\n    - i.e., if we adopt `x ..= y`, that implies deprecating the existing `x...y` pattern syntax.\r\n- A tempting option is to \"do nothing\" and just write `(x..y).inclusive()` or some such thing. However, that will not work in patterns (which would presumably stay as `x...y`). This raises some questions of its own:\r\n    - Do we still want [*exclusive* range patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37854)? e.g. `match 3 { 1..3 => false, .. }`\r\n        - If so, then we have the same potential confusion!\r\n    - @withoutboats seems to think that maybe we do not want such patterns. Myself and @joshtriplett were dubious of this; I think we both had the opinion that they are the kind of thing that seems irrelevant right up until you want them, and then they feel **absolutely necessary**. =)\r\n- Another issue around *exclusive range patterns* is that the interact poorly with the (also unstable) [slice patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23121) (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23121 for details).\r\n\r\nI think one thing that came out of this discussion was that it would be good to make a decision on **all the conflicting factors at once**. In other words, to adopt a decision that settles:\r\n\r\n- What to do about exclusive range **expressions**?\r\n- Do we have to deprecate/change the existing **exclusive range patterns**?\r\n- What to do about **inclusive range patterns**?\r\n- What to do about **slice patterns**?\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Before I begin this write up, I want to say that I felt very uncertain that at each moment in the conversation we were all actually talking about the same concept. For example, Niko says that \"exclusive range patterns seem irrelevant right up until you want them,\" but I thought Niko and Josh were talking about inclusive range expressions at that time.\r\n\r\n(And I think in the last part of Niko's post, the first bullet which currently reads \"exclusive range expressions\" should say \"inclusive range expressions\".)\r\n\r\n### TL;DR my opinion\r\n\r\nAbout range expressions:\r\n\r\n* We should not introduce *any* syntax for inclusive range expressions - neither `...` nor `..=`.\r\n* We should add to the prelude a function which takes an exclusive range value and returns an inclusive range value. So you'd write `inclusive(0..10)` (the name can be bikeshedded).\r\n\r\nAbout range patterns:\r\n\r\n* We should not introduce exclusive range patterns, or any way to create one.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the only material change we should make is a libs change: add a function to the prelude.\r\n\r\n### Range expressions\r\n\r\nFundamental to my argument is the fact that iterating through an inclusive range value is an uncommon need. I think this is borne out by the fact that despite the RFC being accepted 18 months ago, we still haven't stabilized this feature - not because of implementation issues but because we aren't happy with the trade off.\r\n\r\nI think inclusive range expressions are needed often enough that we should support a straightforward way of creating them, but not often enough that they overcome any of the downsides of the syntaxes we've discussed so far.\r\n\r\nIn particular, a downside every syntactic solution has shared is that none of them are really self-documenting. It is relatively non-obvious that `0...10` or `0..=10` is an *inclusive* range expression. Since they will be encountered relatively infrequently, this will be a stumbling block for users encountering them for the first time.\r\n\r\nThat is, if the user even notices that they aren't dealing with a \"normal\" `..` range. Of course, this is the big problem with `...`, but `..=` doesn't *totally eliminate* the problem. Its easy, when skimming through code, to miss that one `=` character (or `^` or `:` or whatever else). Not as easy as the extra `.`, but I'm not convinced its noticeable enough.\r\n\r\nI actually think that there is a \"noticability vs obviousness\" trade off between `...` and `..=`. I think its *more obvious* what `...` means (unless you're coming from Ruby, where the two syntaxes have the opposite meaning) than `..=`, but its definitely *less noticable*.\r\n\r\nBut I think a prelude function like `inclusive(0..10)` is both more obvious and more noticable than any syntax we've discussed. Yes, its more characters to type, but the downside of that attribute is relative to the frequency of use.\r\n\r\nIt also sidesteps any of the parsing & tokenizing issues, and helps users with the (very annoying) range vs method precedence issue that requires them to write `(0..10).filter` and such.\r\n\r\n### Range patterns\r\n\r\nThe main reason I think we shouldn't add `..` is that it introduces ambiguity around slice patterns, which I think are useful. I'd like to solve that problem by not having to solve it.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that I think they're pretty bad style (I know other people disagree). For example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nif let 1..10 = x { .. }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is confusing, because `10` doesn't match the pattern that contains it. Niko mentioned that this isn't really different from exclusive range expressions not yielding `10`, but I think the big difference there is that we have a great deal of Dijsktra-style historical precedent (and use case) for supporting exclusive ranges. Coming into Rust, I expected iterative & slicing ranges to be exclusive, but I didn't have that expectation for patterns.\r\n\r\nIt also has the \"off-by-one\" issue that `..`/`...` in expressions has.\r\n\r\nI know Niko has mentioned that he'd like to write:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmatch x {\r\n    0..10 => { ... }\r\n    10..20 => { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I would really strongly prefer to see:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmatch x {\r\n    0...9 => { ... }\r\n    10...19 => { .. }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was surprised that Niko meant that he sometimes finds these \"absolutely necessary,\" so I'd like to hear more counterarguments. Since they have to be a constexpr, it seems much more like a 'nice to have' than an 'absolutely necessary' thing to me.\r\n\r\nI definitely feel easier to sway on exclusive range patterns than inclusive range expressions.\r\n\r\n### The consistency argument\r\n\r\nNiko's mentioned that having both `..` and `...` in both expressions and patterns matters to him because of consistency. I'm basically entirely unmoved by this argument. Iterating through a range and matching on a range are not really analogous operations, and it makes sense that there would be differences between how we treat them.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there isn't even an implementation connect: `1..10` produces a Range value, whereas `1...10` matches an integer value. Its not like they have a structuring/destructuring connection in the way that most of our symmetrical expression/pattern syntaxes do.\r\n\r\nIt seems more technically correct to call the patterns \"domain patterns\" than \"range patterns\" \ud83e\udd13, which highlights the nonanalogousness.",

    "body": "@petrochenkov I assume those were meant to end in `F`, not `C`?\r\n\r\nI've run into the same case with hex range patterns, e.g. `0x8000...0x9FFF => /* body */`. I find that `0x8000..0xA000` has slightly more intuitive properties, like without having to think about it I immediately see that the size of the range is `0xA000 - 0x8000 = 0x2000` and that the next adjacent range starts at `0xA000`.\r\n\r\nDealing with the `+1` required to see these facts in an inclusive range is a small difference I can live with, but exclusive ranges (both patterns and expressions) typically suit my work better.",

    "body": "My main reason for wanting inclusive ranges to be simple is that I've run into situations more than once where I'm passing in a stop value in a variable and it's exactly the maximum value that one variable type can hold, so the only solutions to rule out overflow at compile time are:\r\n\r\n1. Using an inclusive range (cleanest, but not stable)\r\n2. Upcasting before the `+ 1` (assumes I'm not already on `u64` and is inelegant)\r\n3. Taking the lesser of the value and the maximum minus one for the range, then running the task one more time if appropriate.\r\n\r\nBuilding a habit of using inclusive ranges rather than adding `+ 1` to an algorithm where it has no inherent purpose is a non-trivial way to guard against encountering them again later in `cargo fuzz`... and using a \"make inclusive from exclusive\" function with more characters to its name than `+ 1` gives the impression that inclusive ranges are an exceptional thing, rather than something you should be habitually using.\r\n\r\nThat's one of the biggest reasons I'm against it. It conveys the impression that inclusive ranges are a hack, to be used when exclusive ranges are demonstrated to have failed.",

See also datetimes, like how ISO8601 allows T24:00, since a day is [00:00, 24:00), not [00:00, 23:59:59].  Or strings, or rationals, or ...\r\n\r\nGiven a choice of only exclusive or only inclusive, I'll take exclusive every time.\r\n\r\n(Aside: The `1 <= x <= N` pattern for indexing is actually better done as `0 < x <= N`, which is also exclusive--though half-closed instead of half-open--for the same reasons Dijkstra said, just switched around for 1-based indexing instead of 0-based.)",

The clamp thread was talking about allowing `.clamp(1...9)`, but the code ends up looking something like this:\r\n```\r\n    fn clamp(self, r: RangeInclusive<Self>) -> Self where Self : Sized {\r\n        match r {\r\n            RangeInclusive::Empty { .. } =>\r\n                panic!(\"Cannot clamp to an empty range\"),\r\n            RangeInclusive::NonEmpty { start, end } => {\r\n                assert!(start <= end, \"Cannot clamp to a degenerate range\");\r\n                if self < start { start }\r\n                else if self > end { end }\r\n                else { self }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNeeding to deal with `RangeInclusive::Empty` there feels unnecessary since the goal is just to accept the pair with nice syntax.  If it weren't an enum, it could just be ` fn clamp(self, RangeInclusive { start, end }: RangeInclusive<Self>)`, and much cleaner.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have a good answer for what to do about it, though, since requiring .into_iter() on inclusive but not exclusive would also be unfortunate...",

    "body": "So this thread has been going on for one and a half years now.  I just finished reading through all of it and would like to post a concise recap for newcomers and to hopefully help us come to a decision:\r\n\r\nWhat Rust Stable does today:\r\n\r\n`0..5` represents a half-open range, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] that cannot be used in pattern matching\r\n`0...5` represents a closed range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] that can only be used in pattern matching.\r\n\r\nSeveral forms have been proposed for an additional closed range syntax that can be used outside of pattern matching.  I will cover each one and the benefits and drawbacks of them.\r\n\r\n`0...5` \r\n\r\nPros:  Consistent with existing pattern matching syntax, makes the language feel more cohesive assuming no changes are made to the pattern matching syntax.\r\n\r\nCons: Easy to mistype and cause off by one errors, also easy to misunderstand the intent due to other languages using this operator to communicate different concepts.\r\n\r\n`0..=5`\r\n\r\nPros: More difficult to mistype, more semantically clear\r\n\r\nCons: Inconsistent with existing pattern matching syntax.  May cause users to ask: Why is it ... here but ..= here?\r\n\r\n`0..^5`\r\n\r\nVery similar to `..=` but has an additional con in that it looks like an exponentiation operator.\r\n\r\n`inclusive(0..5)`\r\n\r\nPros: Exceedingly semantically clear.  Won't be mistyped.\r\n\r\nCons: Kind of long.  Also inconsistent with pattern matching syntax.\r\n\r\n`0....5`\r\n\r\nPros: Avoids the mistyping issue of `...` as well\r\n\r\nCons: Poor semantics, inconsistent with pattern matching syntax and similar to pattern matching syntax.\r\n\r\n`[0..5]` Unusable.  brackets already have syntactic significance in the language.\r\n\r\n`0..<=5` Unusable.  Conflicts with existing syntax to compare a value to a range.\r\n\r\nEvery option listed that has a con of \"inconsistent with pattern matching syntax\" could be improved if we were to change the pattern matching syntax, but that route has backwards compatibility issues.  Alternatively we could also make `...` and (pick your syntax here) equivalent within pattern matching in order to avoid breaking backwards compatibility, but prevent the use of `...` outside of pattern matching.  Perhaps we could also update the style guide to discourage the use of `...` in pattern matching if we were to go down that route.\r\n\r\nThere has also been some discussion about creating a more general purpose range syntax that would allow you to make both the upper and lower bounds inclusive or exclusive but we probably don't even need that syntax as having half-open and closed range likely covers over 99.9999% of use cases.\r\n\r\nI tried to represent this discussion as best as I could.  If you feel I didn't express your point adequately please let me know so I can update this.\r\n",

    "body": "I personally would prefer to convert `RangeInclusive` itself into something that doesn't have an `Empty` variant, then make an `IntoIter` have the variant. It makes more sense to me considering how it's essentially impossible to construct an empty range without manually `Empty { at }`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, swap `MAX` and `MIN` on the one edge case that I mentioned. That makes it harder to write more general code involving `RangeInclusive`, but it seems like a reasonable solution to the problem.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what happens, I'm very much in support of stabilising the type in the standard library, which will exist regardless of syntax concerns. It allows libraries to write stable code that allows slicing with inclusive ranges, so that by the time that the syntax is stabilised, people have already implemented the code that uses the types. The syntax and types are under different feature flags for a reason.",

I think many of us feel fatigued by the discussion.\r\n\r\nEDIT: To be more specific, I do not want to deprecate `...` in favor of `..=` because:\r\n\r\n* Deprecating syntax is an enormous cost in churn; even if I uniquivocally liked `..=` I don't think it would be worth the deprecation cycle just to get inclusive range expressions on stable.\r\n* I *don't* like `..=`, I think it is non-obvious and unclear; it has the advantage that its less likely to lead to off by one errors but that doesn't mean a user, seeing it for the first time, will know what they're looking at.\r\n* I don't agree with the premise that there needs to be a symmetry between patterns and expressions here, because they do not do any sort of analogous structuring/destructuring operations.",

However I am still in support of `..=`.\r\n\r\nI think at a certain point we have to be willing to ask users to learn something.  Programming as a whole is something to be learned, specialized syntax in general always comes at some cost to semantics.  I don't expect people to recognize syntax at first glance, `..` is just as bad in this regard.\r\n\r\nHowever having an over-abundance of specialized syntax can result in a language looking closer to brainfuck than what we want Rust to be.  So we have to be careful that the cases we choose to turn into special syntax are actually common enough to be worth it.  To be honest now that I've typed this out I'm not entirely sure this case is worth that.  The need for inclusive ranges is not high enough to warrant a syntax.\r\n\r\nHowever the inconsistency still bothers me.  Having an inclusive function and `...` in pattern matching sort of feels like having both grey and gray in the English language.  When we have an opportunity to standardize that a part of me feels like we should.  There are also actual logistical problems in making that change though.  If we were to ever design a Rust 2.0 (That might be insane, I have no idea) maybe we ought to revisit this but I guess for now having both grey and gray is good enough.\r\n\r\nI am in support of using an `inclusive` function for instances outside of pattern matching and `...` in pattern matching at this time.",

    "body": "As @withoutboats said, I think many of us are weary of this discussion; I for one have been sitting it out for a while. That said, I took some time to re-read (thanks for the summary @Xaeroxe!) and revisit my thoughts here.\r\n\r\nIMO, **the most important problem right now is the incomplete combination of syntaxes we provide**: `...` in patterns, `..` for expressions. This pair of syntaxes *strongly* leads you to expect that `..` would work in patterns and `...` in expressions -- and they don't. I believe that this is not a tenable design in the long term, and really want to fix it.\r\n\r\nI also think that, given that we've provided syntax for both kinds of ranges, it's probably best to continue doing so. That leaves us with a couple of options:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize `...` in expressions and add `..` to patterns. This is the least painful change, but has well-discussed downsides around off-by-one errors. Still, other languages have this combination and have not, to my knowledge, suffered terribly with such errors.\r\n\r\n- Deprecate `...` in patterns and expressions, add `..=` to both, and add `..` to patterns. Resolves the downsides above, is more painful (because of deprecation), and opens the door to other kinds of ranges (like left-exclusive) in the future.\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm largely rehashing discussion, and honestly, I don't think there's a lot more to be said at this point; I think we've exposed the tradeoffs and just need the lang team to do an evaluation and reach a decision. But the main thrust of my comment is the initial point, about why I think *something* needs to change here (and why just adding `inclusive` isn't enough, IMO).",

We have no reliable way to judge whether the problems are minor or whether they just rarely come to our attention.\r\n\r\nAlso, using `...` feels like it runs counter to the \"avoid footguns unless the trade-offs are too severe\" aspect of Rust's design philosophy and emerging best practices.

    "body": "I'd vote `...` for a rest slice for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. People are likely to already be familiar with `...` meaning \"rest\" from languages like CoffeeScript (CoffeeScript uses `rest...` in function signatures for varargs and calls them \"splats\") and English (Using the correct Unicode codepoint or not, it's three periods which look like an ellipsis, not four, and people do a decent job of understanding the ellipsis to approximately mean \"and there's more but we're not saying it out loud\" in English, purely from encountering it in use.)\r\n\r\n2. Unless I'm missing something about Rust's syntax, using `..` and `..=` for ranges but `...` for rest slices would mean that, in every situation, typing `...` when you meant `..` or vice-versa would still be a compile-time error.\r\n\r\n   For this, I'm operating on two assumptions:\r\n  \r\n   1. That using rest syntax alone (outside a sequence-unpacking context) would be disallowed as a typo-prone no-op. (ie. `for _ in ...rest` would be the same as `for _ in rest` if allowed, but almost certainly a typo.\r\n\r\n   2. That using an open-ended range as a pattern to be assigned to would be invalid. (ie. `let [first, ..rest] =` would be invalid.)",

    "body": "The lang team discussed this feature again in our meeting today, and arrived at roughly the following matrix:\r\n\r\n- Supporting `...` in patterns and `..` in expressions, and nothing else, is an untenable design; it leads users to expect syntax to work that won't.\r\n\r\n- Allowing `...` and `..` in both places would help, but the off-by-one problem is a real concern; none of us are eager to receive reports of people spending hours tracking down an errant period.\r\n\r\n- Moving to `..=` and `..` is less aesthetically appealing, but avoids the very real *practical* problems above. We can also roll it out in a very gentle fashion: first introduce `..=` as an alternative syntax (which rustfmt can rewrite to), and only after it has become idiomatic, deprecate `...`.\r\n\r\nIn case you can't tell, the team feels that `..=` and `..` is our best path forward. This issue has also been discussed to the point that it's very unlikely that new arguments will be raised, so we're ready to take the plunge: we're looking for someone who would like to implement `..=` notation for both patterns and expressions, and subsequently we'll go to FCP!",

    "body": "When I first looked at Rust, I was *really* surprised about the `..` syntax. `(1..10).sum()` is... the sum of integers from 1 to 9? If you present this syntax to a newcomer and ask him what it means, it's very likely that he'll expect it to go from 1 to 10. And he would be right to do so, since you'd expect symmetric syntax to express symmetric ranges. Why should the 1 be included but not the 10?\r\n\r\nAdding another asymmetric form `..=` for a symmetric range makes this even more visually inconsistent. One might ask why the left side needs no `=` to be inclusive, so it would be `=..=` for inclusive ranges on both sides.\r\n\r\nSomething like the [Swift syntax](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH6-ID73) (`..<` for exclusive and `...` for inclusive) would avoid these problems and improve readability. You can easily guess the meaning correctly even if you're completely new to the language, so there's one less thing to remember. I would have expected something like this to be chosen, especially considering Rust's push towards newcomer-friendliness.\r\n",

    "body": "@rkarp To some extent, that's probably down to pre-existing bias.\r\n\r\nFor example, there's a lot of Python influence in Rust and Python uses the same kind of half-open ranges. (ie. Python's `range(1, 5)` or `myList[1:5]` both have the same behaviour as Rust's `1..5`)\r\n\r\nThe justification for that in Python was tied to there only being one syntax and having a half-open syntax made it easier to do things like `head, tail = myList[:pivot], mylist[pivot:]`.\r\n\r\nThat said, given that Rust has passed 1.0, there are fairly strict rules about not breaking existing code. `..` for exclusive outside of patterns and `...` for exclusive inside patterns have to remain valid. \r\n\r\n`..=` works because you can accept `..` (exclusive) and `..=` (inclusive) everywhere and treat `...` as a deprecated synonym for `..` in patterns.",

We also might want to add ability to omit one side of the interval in patterns later on for e.g. exhaustive integer matches.\r\n\r\nSo while @clarcharr\u2019s observation is not necessarily pointing out ambiguity when current grammar is considered, it is certainly an ambiguity when considering potential future expansions which might conflict with the proposal to use `..=` for patterns.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind I would suggest to use some other symbol here. `^` seems fairly okay to me, as it is only used in an expression context currently IIRC.",

If you only want to iterate over the last few values of e.g. a `u32`, it's often easier to add one inside the loop. And if you really want to iterate to `2^B-1` for some obscure reason, then you can always stick `if i == END { break; }` at the end of a loop.\r\n\r\nJust because our standard unsigned integers support 2^32 or 2^64 values doesn't mean the highest representable value gets used very often. And if you're doing something with `u8`, don't forget that it's probably easier for the CPU to use `u32` for a counter anyway.",

On the other hand, this sort of ambiguity arises frequently, and is addressed by the tokenizer. That is, if we consider `..=` as a token in our parser, it's not ambiguous even if we add `5..` patterns in the future; you simply need to write a space between the `..` and the `=` (e.g., `let 5.. = x`).\r\n- the ambiguity with respect to macro-rules. This is indeed a pain and unfortunate, and it's one of the reasons that we've been moving towards a different system for \"macros 2.0\", where we avoid exposing the set of \"compound tokens\" to the end-user.\r\n    - in the end, we can handle `macro_rules!` back-compat via some special-case code if necessary; in any case, I think there is no avoiding this sort of problem except by using `...`.",

This is probably to make it consistent with other operators, such as `a+b` and `a + b`. These of course, do the same, and allow people to use different syntax styles.

    "body": "The elephant in the room is that `..` is actually the real problem here because of its symmetric look but asymmetric meaning. The \"right thing to do\" would probably entail deprecating it, but there is no will to do that because so much code uses it already.\r\n\r\nDeprecating the perfectly consistent `...` (symmetric look, symmetric meaning) is the easy way out, but at the cost of adding yet another inconsistent operator in `..=`. It seems like adding bad design to work around previous bad design.\r\n\r\nThere is another problem with this because of this double inconsistency: There is no good way of adding the last two remaining inclusiveness variants (exclusive on both sides and exclusive on the left side only). Since both `..` and `..=` would already have an implicit `=` on the left side, we'd have to negate that somehow, possibly with a `<`. So they would have to look something like this:\r\n- `<..=` for `(a; b]`\r\n- `<..` for `(a; b)`\r\n\r\nGood luck guessing correctly what these mean as a newcomer. So they would probably (rightfully) never even be considered to be added.\r\n\r\nIf `..` wasn't so entrenched or didn't even exist, coming up with a consistent design for all this from scratch doesn't seem so hard, for example:\r\n- `..` (or `...`) for `[a; b]`\r\n- `..<` for `[a; b)`\r\n- `<..` for `(a; b]`\r\n- `<..<` for `(a; b)`\r\n\r\nI have a feeling that the last two variants might be useful at some point, should we really block the path towards them so quickly? In any case, the *only* good reason to choose `..=` over deprecating `..` is breaking much less old code, but it would at best be a necessary evil, nothing to be celebrated.\r\n\r\n_Edit: Added an example and some comments for more clarity._",

    "body": "I agree with @rkarp on that `..` is the actual problem here, not `...` or `..=`. The asymmetric meaning is especially bad considering that other (more popular) languages actually *do* assign a symmetric meaning to it. Both Kotlin, Ruby and Haskell consider 5 to be in the range 3..5 for example. Mathematical papers also seem to favor that. The worst thing here is that beginners have no chance of guessing the behavior of 3..5 in Rust: you would either decide that 4 and only 4 is a member of the range 3..5 (iteration over the dots) or that both 3 and 5 are also in it (iterating over 'everything we can see' and the extrapolation of the dots).\r\n\r\nI disagree on the difficulty of changing this however. I think @adelarsq suggestion could be implemented relatively painlessly. For reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[1..4] // 1, 2, 3, 4\r\n[1..4[ // 1, 2, 3\r\n]1..4] // 2, 3, 4\r\n]1..4[ // 2, 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny occurrence of `x..y` (without square brackets) could be translated to `[x..y[` and emit a compiler warning. After a few releases the compiler could simply refuse to compile \"bare\" range notations and maybe even offer tools to automatically convert to the new notation.",

I do think that `..=` is not the ideal operator for an inclusive range; it's simply the best option currently on the table. But deprecating the current exclusive range operator would be excessively painful, and off-putting to existing Rust users and projects.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other proposals that *could* work.

Most notably, `+1` and `-1` can cause integer overflow/underflow.)\r\n\r\nHere's an example which [works in `nightly`](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=f1fbce82f952d1719cc424acb9915459&version=nightly) (via the old candidate for inclusive range syntax) where...\r\n\r\n* ...whichever loop you put first will panic at overflow/underflow in debug builds\r\n* ...they'll behave completely opposite to intended in release builds (ie. The \"0 to 0\" will iterate 256 times and the \"0 to 255\" won't iterate at all)\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![feature(inclusive_range_syntax)]\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let max = 255u8;\r\n    let user_provided = 0u8;\r\n\r\n    for x in 0...user_provided-1 {\r\n        println!(\"(0 to 0, exclusive via 'inclusive - 1'): {}\", x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for x in 0..max+1 {\r\n        println!(\"(0 to 255, inclusive via 'exclusive + 1'): {}\", x);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "# Request for Stabilization\r\n\r\nI'd like to stabilize inclusive range by **1.26** (beta on March 30th, stable on May 11th) or before. A stabilization PR has been submitted as #47813.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe following 3 features will be stabilized:\r\n\r\n* `inclusive_range_syntax` \u2014 The `a..=b` and `..=b` syntax in an expression:\r\n\r\n    ```rust\r\n    for i in 1..=10 {\r\n        println!(\"{:?}\", &a[..=i]);\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* `dotdoteq_in_patterns` \u2014 The `a..=b` syntax in a pattern:\r\n\r\n    ```rust\r\n    match c {\r\n        b'0'..=b'9' => c - b'0',\r\n        b'a'..=b'z' => c - b'a' + 10,\r\n        b'A'..=b'Z' => c - b'A' + 10,\r\n        _ => unreachable!(),\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    (Note: the `a...b` syntax is still accepted without warnings) \r\n\r\n* `inclusive_range` \u2014 The `std::ops::{RangeInclusive, RangeInclusiveTo}` types and their fields:\r\n\r\n    ```rust\r\n    let r = 1..=10;\r\n    assert_eq!(r.start, 1);\r\n    assert_eq!(r.end, 10);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nSeveral documentation PRs are submitted by @alercah, thanks!\r\n\r\n* The Book: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/pull/1134\r\n* The Reference: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/reference/pull/215\r\n* Rust-by-Example: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/pull/1015\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nYou may find test cases in:\r\n\r\n* [`run-pass/range_inclusive.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/range_inclusive.rs) \u2014 \r\n    basic tests like using `a..=b` in a for-loop, as an iterator, as a slice index, and precedence of the `..=` operator, and type-checking behavior.\r\n* [`libcore/tests/iter.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6c04c41034c46730fba97bfe9cfa2dd0687c2a5f/src/libcore/tests/iter.rs#L1325) \u2014 \r\n    further tests about the behavior of `a..=b` as an iterator; checks that specializations of `nth()`, `min()`, `max()` and `last()` work correctly, and that after calling `(5..=5).next()` the range becomes `1..=0`.\r\n* [`liballoc/tests/str.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6c04c41034c46730fba97bfe9cfa2dd0687c2a5f/src/liballoc/tests/str.rs#L361), [`liballoc/tests/btree/map.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6c04c41034c46730fba97bfe9cfa2dd0687c2a5f/src/liballoc/tests/btree/map.rs#L181) and [`liballoc/tests/vec.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6c04c41034c46730fba97bfe9cfa2dd0687c2a5f/src/liballoc/tests/vec.rs#L536) \u2014 \r\n    checks that `a..=b` work correctly in various collection types.\r\n* [`parse-fail/range_inclusive.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/parse-fail/range_inclusive.rs) and [`ui/impossible_range.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/impossible_range.rs) \u2014 \r\n    ensures nonsense constructs like `a..=` and `..=` as an expression cannot be compiled\r\n* [`parse-fail/range_inclusive_dotdotdot.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/parse-fail/range_inclusive_dotdotdot.rs) \u2014 \r\n    ensures we reject the deprecated expression syntax `a...b` and `...b`.\r\n* [`run-pass/inc-range-pat.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/inc-range-pat.rs) \u2014 \r\n    ensures using `a..=b` and `a...b` in a pattern are both accepted and are equivalent.\r\n* [`compile-fail/range_traits-1.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/compile-fail/range_traits-1.rs) and [`compile-fail/range_traits-6.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/compile-fail/range_traits-6.rs) \u2014 \r\n    ensures `RangeInclusive` and `RangeInclusiveTo` do not implement `PartialOrd` (like the other ranges), and `RangeInclusive` do not implement `Copy` (can't implement Copy since they are iterators). \r\n* [`libcore/tests/ops.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6c04c41034c46730fba97bfe9cfa2dd0687c2a5f/src/libcore/tests/ops.rs#L51) \u2014 \r\n    checks that iterating a manually constructed `RangeInclusive` instance works.\r\n\r\n## Unresolved questions\r\n\r\n* Using `a..=b` in a for-loop has much lower performance than `a..(b+1)` due to its `next()` being more complex and less optimizer-friendly. This is currently being tracked in #45222. This is currently mitigated by #48012 when using iterator methods instead of a for-loop.\r\n\r\n    We *might* need to keep the fields of `RangeInclusive` unstable if we don't want to commit to the design in rust-lang/rfcs#1980 yet.",

But as it is now, I think [consistency with Range](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28237#issuecomment-363502299) is the best option.  We can put this case with `Chain` in the \"well, it turns out [internal iteration is just faster](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-fold-ok-is-composable-internal-iteration/4434?u=scottmcm) sometimes\" bucket.\r\n\r\nOne other thing that was unresolved, also related to iterating: do we want to commit to any particular representation of the RangeInclusive once done iterating?  Right now [it ends up at `1..=0`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcore/tests/iter.rs#L1391), but there were [other options discussed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1980#issuecomment-298294861).  I don't know if documentation would be sufficient to keep people from relying on it, though the current one does make the post-iteration range quite useless, which at least discourages it.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> there's no _fundamental_ reason for it to be.\r\n\r\nIt depends on what invariants we can enforce.  In the two previous formulations with an extra bit of state, there was nothing enforcing that that bit was actually set when we were done iterating (and in fact it _wasn't_ set on literals like `100..=0`), so the loop exit condition needs to be compound, which means that LLVM is no longer willing to unroll it for us, so we get worse performance.  Fully fixing that seems like it means either making the struct bigger and not having pub fields, making `RangeInclusive: !Iterator`, or making LLVM better at optimizing these kinds of loops.\r\n\r\nThat said, I tried some different ways of writing `RangeInclusive::next`, and it looks like [my past self's choice to match on an `Option<Ordering>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcore/iter/range.rs#L336) is making LLVM very sad--just putting comparison operators there instead is giving much better assembly.  **Edit** PR up: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/48057",

But it would be more verbose to write `until` everywhere that `..` is used, because it's much more common than `..=` (so if words were used, `..` should be assigned the shorter word).",
