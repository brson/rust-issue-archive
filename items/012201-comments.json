    "body": "This was discussed some on IRC. To clarify the consensus, the basic strategy we had in mind is to:\n1. Refactor TypeContents into a visitor that walks the, well, type contents.\n2. TypeContents uses this visitor to compute its bitsets.\n3. In the case of an error, a separate path of code uses the visitor to walk down and compute a \"path\" from the type to the smallest error case. Something like \"this is not send because `x.y.z` is not sendable\". This path probably has the same form as the paths that the borrow checker reports, though it may not use the same data structures.\n\nThe reason for this approach is that we do not want to compute nor store the full paths in the normal case, since TypeContents are computed for a LOT of types, and only a very few of them have errors.\n",
