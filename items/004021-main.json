  "body": "Now it's possible to invoke macros in statement and item position. The extra argument that syntax extensions in item position take is now optional (things defined with `macro_rules!` cannot see it).\n\nAt expansion time, the expansion of a macro defined with `macro_rules!` is parsed as an expr, an item, or a stmt, depending on where it is.\n\nThe delimiters around the RHS of a macro are no longer transcribed (this interfered with the parsing of items). This means that `macro_rules! mytuple( () => (1,2,3) )` doesn't work; an extra set of delimiters must be added around the `(1,2,3)`.\n\nCloses #3086.\n\nOutstanding issues: \n- Expanding to multiple items is still not done.\n- `{ my_expr_mac!() + 16 }` is a parse error because the macro is interpreted as a statement. Workaround: wrap in parentheses.\n",
