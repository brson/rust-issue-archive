    "body": "This bug may not be so much as we don't have support for this but rather we're just not doing this. We're not using segmented stacks the way that they're supposed to be used in the compiler, and our strategy on _all_ platforms should align with that of `chkstk`. I've looked into LLVM and it is indeed implemented, but it's all special-cased on codegen for the windows platform.\n\nTo pursue this, we will need to modify to accept an option to codegen chkstk on all platforms, hopefully take a symbol as well (so we can implement our own), and then implement the necessary prologue for all our platforms and architectures (I have a feeling that LLVM only implements it for x86 windows right now).\n\nIt would probably be worth chatting with the upstream LLVM guys before pursuing this just to make sure that we're aligned correctly in how to do this.\n",
