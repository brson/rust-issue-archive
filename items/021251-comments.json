    "body": "Thinking about this a bit more:\n\nGrowing a HashMap from 50% load to 100% load means the average load factor is 75%. At that load factor, the average probe sequence length will be somewhere in the neighborhood of 0-1. That means that even if we set the maximum load factor to 100%, the average lookup will still be extremely fast.\n\nIf we do set the maximum load factor to 100%, in the worst case there will be log(n) lookup cost. That... still sounds pretty good, and memory accesses are sequential. This \"average worst case bound\" matches the worst case bound of a hashtable chained with balanced binary search trees.\n\nBecause of these two points, I'm now inclined to consider upping the load factor to 100%.\n",

Average/maximum probe length is important for _reads_, because that is how long a read takes. \n\nHowever a write in a basically full table may require basically every element to be touched. e.g. you have one empty space left in your table, you hash to the space _after it_, you now need to shift _every_ element in the table over one. That's an O(n) operation, and completely unacceptable to occur. And it is _expected_ to occur on the last few insertions. With `k` spaces left, you expect to move `n/k` elements on insertion or removal, because that's how far away the space you need is.\n",
