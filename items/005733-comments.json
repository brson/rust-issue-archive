    "body": "Two more things that can be turned into issues and dealt with in the future:\n- #5737: It would be convenient to have the representation of complex numbers be compatible with C by making it packed, but I don't think that's currently possible. Luckily that can be changed later without even touching the interface at all. \n- #5738: There's also the question about how frequently the rational number should normalize - `Mpq` does it after each operation, and then exposes a raw interface for doing a few operations without normalizing. If it's always guaranteed to be normalized, `#[deriving(Eq)]` might as well be used. That would probably also mean making the fields `priv` and using scary names for raw manipulation methods.\n",
