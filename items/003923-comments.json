    "body": "Thanks!\n\n`git rebase mozilla/incoming` should eliminate all those merges. When you push again you will have to do `push -f` because rebasing will change your history. In general I suggest resisting the urge to repeatedly merge from master while working on a development branch, because it results in this kind of noisy history. I typically do the work based off of a single upstream revision and submit the pull request without any merges.\n\nCan you add a test for this? I realize the tests for this module are difficult, using a bunch of conditional compilation, but it's important. Note that every network test needs to use a different port number (or else they will fail randomly by failing to bind the port) and the ones in use aren't obvious.\n\nI see whitespace at the end of lines in this patch which will cause 'make check' to fail.\n",
