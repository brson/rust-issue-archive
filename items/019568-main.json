  "body": "This pull request tries to fix #19340, which states two ICE cases related to enum struct variants.\n\nIt is my first attempt to fix the compiler. I found this solution by trial and error, so the method used to fix the issue looks very hacky. Please review it, and direct me to find a better solution.\n\nI'm also to add test cases. Where should I put them? Maybe `src/test/run-pass/issue-19340.rs`?\n",
