    "body": "> It's a little surprising that the way you reverse a collection in-place is via a method on its iterator, it seems like it should be on the collection directly.\n\nI don't understand what you're saying. The `reverse` method on iterators doesn't reverse a container, it reverses the elements yielded by an iterator in-place:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut xs = [1, 2, 3];\n    let mut ys = [4, 5, 6];\n    xs.mut_iter().chain(ys.mut_iter()).reverse_();\n    println!(\"{:?} {:?}\", xs, ys);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the trailing underscore is a workaround for a compiler bug / language design issue. A generic implementation of a trait causes the name to be reserved on _all_ types if the trait is in scope.\n",
