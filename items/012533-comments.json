    "body": "We ended up having some non-determinism in our AST through two sources I found which made the stage1-generated and stage2-generated libsyntax libraries have different hashes. If these two libraries are different, it means all of the syntax extension tests start failing. This is obviously a hazard, but it wasn't too bad to fix.\n1. Command line `--cfg` flags are located in the `CrateConfig` inside of a `Crate`. This meant that different `--cfg` flags in different orderings or amounts would generate different hashes. I chose to manually alter how hashing the crate works inside of `Svh::calculate` in order to fix this problem. This sadly still has the side effect of `--cfg foo` is not equal to `--cfg bar --cfg foo`. The latter case creates one more identifier, meaning that all ident symbols are off-by-one. Thankfully our build process always passes the same number of `--cfg` flags, so we should be good for now...\n2. `format!(\"{a}{b}\", a=foo(), b=bar())` was expanded in fashion where the order of execution of `a` and `b` was nondeterministic. This was simply because it was generated by iterating a hashmap, so the last commit now moves to using a vector directly to get a deterministic ordering.\n\nAfter implementing these two fixes, I'm seeing stable version hashes between stage1/stage2. This is obviously still quite brittle, I believe, because things like the `env!` syntax extension will affect compilation (I believe).\n\nFor now though, the tests seem to be passing. At least it helped uncover one real bug!\n",
