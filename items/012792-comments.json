    "body": "@brson Do you have a clear definition of what the \"minimum necessary understanding of unicode\" means? Any equality comparison between Unicode strings is pretty much meaningless without normalization. Though I have to admit for that use-case you can get away supporting only NFD and NFKD. NFC and NFKC are more interesting for saving storage space and implementing protocols that require them.\n\nPersonally I'd like Rust to support at least some basic Unicode operations, without pulling in ICU. Support for this need not necessarily be within `libstd`, though it might be worthwhile having a separate discussion concerning which operations are the bare minimum to support on a Unicode string type, without requiring additional crates.\n",
