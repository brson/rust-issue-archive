  "body": "With `~[T]` no longer growable, the `FromIterator` impl for `~[T]` doesn't make\nmuch sense. Not only that, but nearly everywhere it is used is to convert from\na `Vec<T>` into a `~[T]`, for the sake of maintaining existing APIs. This turns\nout to be a performance loss, as it means every API that returns `~[T]`, even a\nsupposedly non-copying one, is in fact doing extra allocations and memcpy's.\nEven `&[T].to_owned()` is going through `Vec<T>` first.\n\nRemove the `FromIterator` impl for `~[T]`, and adjust all the APIs that relied\non it to start using `Vec<T>` instead. This includes rewriting\n`&[T].to_owned()` to be more efficient, among other performance wins.\n\nAlso add a new mechanism to go from `Vec<T>` -> `~[T]`, just in case anyone\ntruly needs that, using the new trait `FromVec`.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
