It might be in the README file, or it might be displayed when the program starts up. This copyright notice should mention the year of completion of the most recent major version; it can mention years of completion of previous major versions, but that is optional. \n\nThe per-file copyright notice can just be a summary of the copyright across the whole work. Rust is _already_ just including a reference to the list of copyright holders (all contributors) and the real license file. Third party projects included in the tree need to be dealt with separately, but there's no reason for each Rust file to be an independent work. It's just needless complexity.\n",
