    "body": "> Suggested fix: if we need to increase capacity past the current capacity, simply double the current capacity. So above, our result would be: \"x capacity = 2046, y capacity = 2048\".\n\nSeems reasonable; note that this is subtler for HashMap and VecDeque because they _require_ that capacity be a power-of-two implementation-wise.\n\n> Recommendation: Document in the API that, if reserve() needs to allocate memory less than double its current capacity, it will double its current capacity.\n\nAmortization only requires that it grows by a constant factor; I see little value in specifying doubling (indeed there are many that argue that >= 2 is _awful_ because repeated grows can't re-use any space (2^k >= [sum i=0 to k-1 of 2^i]). If you need tighter control of reservation use reserve_exact. If you just need amortization over many ops, don't even bother reserving, the collection will do appropriate amortization _for you_.\n\nIn general we've been _very careful_ not to overspecify these APIs. Note that the _general_ API is especially fuzzy because of HashMap, which you can't efficiently compute capacity for due to impl details. Also it may be desirable for a HashMap to reallocate if a long collision chain occurs. I'm not fundamentally opposed to tightening up the _specific_ guarantees Vec offers, but I'd like to tread carefully here.\n\n> Recommendation: Change the name of reserve() to something more specific, so that people don't get confused and use reserve() where they mean to use reserve_exact(). Something like reserve_round_up().\n\nEh. We [used to](http://doc.rust-lang.org/0.10/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reserve_additional) have the names `reserve` (now `reserve_exact`) and `reserve_additional` (now `reserve`). In practice this seemed backwards since empirically `reserve_additional` was what people wanted (I have some buffer and am anticipating k more items, do at most one reallocation for inserting this). Also it's not like it's a huge semantics foot-gun. At worst using `reserve` inappropriately wastes some space, right?\n",

    "body": "> Seems reasonable; note that this is subtler for HashMap and VecDeque because they require that capacity be a power-of-two implementation-wise.\n\nShouldn't be too bad, as long as it starts with a power of two it will remain a power of two. I can take a look at it.\n\n> Amortization only requires that it grows by a constant factor I see little value in specifying doubling\n\nI agree. So I think it should note in the API that it will grow by an implementation-defined constant factor.\n\nAs of right now even that isn't in the API, and theoretically the algorithm could change to something like allocating twice as much space as you ask for, or allocating exactly as much as you ask for, which would hurt run time complexities of functions which use reserve() (eg read_to_end referenced above).\n\n> Also it's not like it's a huge semantics foot-gun. At worst using reserve inappropriately wastes some space, right?\n\nI'm not sure if this is the proper approach to this. It should be up to the user to decide what problems/inefficiencies are tolerable, not the library writers. Considering this is something of a systems language I'd imagine there are plenty of use cases where accidentally allocating twice as much memory as you meant to could be a very bad thing.\n\nGiven the ambiguous name of reserve() this is an error that's sure to happen repeatedly. Having eg reserve_round_up and reserve_exact, and no function just called reserve, removes the ambiguity entirely and basically removes that whole class of errors. Additionally, there seems to be a large upside and little to no downside to changing the names. We could just mark reserve() as deprecated and have reserve_round_up perform the same job.\n",

Right now it will do two full reallocs, the first of which is basically useless and only gives you one additional element in space.  If you did the doubling algorithm (or multiplying by any constant factor) instead of rounding up to powers of 2, this would only need one realloc.\n\n> I'm sure the documentation will tell you the vector grows using that algorithm.\n\nAll the documentation says is:\n\n> Reserves capacity for at least additional more elements to be inserted in the given Vec<T>. The collection may reserve more space to avoid frequent reallocations.\n\nThis doesn't even guarantee amortization (or anything really) which is why I suggest the API/documention specifies that if the reserve requires less than double (or any constant factor) times its current capacity, it will increase it's capacity by multiplying it by that constant factor.\n",
