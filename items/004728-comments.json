    "body": "The bug here, as I understand it, is that `get_global_state` is using some unsafe pointer manipulation with an `atomic_cxchg` to install a task-global lookup table.\n\nI do not see why this is assigned to maturity milestone #2: backwards compatibility.\n\nIt strikes me as just an enhancement to the code base.  Tagging as I-nominated, and suggest we remove milestone tag entirely.\n",
