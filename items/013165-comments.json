    "body": "I grow slightly worried about all of this removal of `~[T]`, even in a DST world the type will still exist, and it is arguably the appropriate type to return in many of these locations. For example, internally a `MemWriter` should be use a `Vec`, but you should `unwrap` it to a `~[u8]` (frozen vector) because it's no longer pushable/poppable. Other apis, such as `push_exact` should definitely take `Vec<u8>` rather than `~[u8]`. \n\nI'm basically worried about possibly unnecessary churn. @nick29581, do you think that `~[T]` needs to be removed _entirely_ for DST to get implemented? Can it stay where appropriate?\n",

But it's stored in a separate allocation, which means it can be moved between `Vec<T>` and `~[T]` without reallocation.\n\nIn any case, I am not opposed to returning `~[T]` from APIs where it makes sense to do so. But during this transition period, any API that still deals with `~[T]` makes it impossible to fix the `deprecated_owned_vector` lint. My feeling is we should transition the standard libraries away from `~[T]` as much as possible, implement DST, and then reintroduce `~[T]` where it makes sense to do so.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton so my issue is that, right now, in my build.. i use `-D warnings`.. so I have to isolate and/or remove all uses of deprecated `~[]` syntax, including in IO. In my local codebase, I have a `VecNgWriter` that accomplishes what this pull does, wrt `MemWriter`. I also isolated the `~[u8]` interaction w/i a function that I annotated w/ an attribute to allow the lint.\n\nThat being said, I don't think it's fair (or right) to pretty much put this on users, pending the change of `~[]` to the fixed-sized vector type (which, as you observed, is appropriate in this case).\n\nShould users have to wrangle with either 1) warning spam or 2) workarounds/massaging in their code (as I did) in order to continue using `std::io` in the midst of this transition (which, btw, we have no firm timeline let alone articulated plan for when/how it'll be resolved)? I think this pull provides an answer. Can you say that it'll change _again_ after DST lands? Because this is addressing a problem that users are experiencing _right now_. (and for the record, I was considering doing this work myself and I'm glad @sfackler beat me to it, because I'm sloooooow).\n",

If we require `free` to be passed a length in order to support faster allocators (likely), then converting from `Vec<T>` to `~[T]` is going to require a `shrink_to_fit()` call which will make future pushes by the caller slower.\n\nIt's also a significant performance improvement right now, and switching to `~[T]` in the future would be a very negligible one as it only drops it down to 2 words from 3, and it's usually just on the stack. In some cases there are recursive data structures where using the DST `~[T]` would be an improvement, but a replacement similar (but not identical) to the old `~[T]` like LLVM's `TinyPtrVector` would probably be even better.\n",

To be honest, I don't know the answer. I haven't got near to that stage in the implementation. Currently I am adding unsized/sized knowledge into the compiler and that is totally unaffected. My guess is that we don't need to, but it might make things a little bit easier. I would be happy to wait and see - that is do nothing for now and only remove ~[T] when/if we know we have to.\n\nIn general I prefer to move from one solution to another, rather than from one solution to an intermediate encoding to a second solution since I think the risk of missing something is lower.\n",

    "body": "@huonw I hesitate to voice an opinion on library design since I have zero experience there. From the language POV, I would prefer to see [T] used wherever possible (in preference to Vec<T>) because if we provide a nice syntax we should strive to make it the default and avoid the situation where there are non-obvious choices to make (or worse, choices based only on the aesthetic opinions of the user). It seems that the story is [T] if the size is fixed and Vec<T> if the size can change, but then the cases you point out are difficult because one can't know the size-mutability intent ahead of time and we should expose the implementation detail that Vec<T> is used internally to construct the result. We could have two of each method, one returning Vec<T>, one [T], but that seems really bad.\n\nPerhaps the ideal situation is that we return [T] and if the caller changes that immediately to Vec<T> then somehow, magically that is free. Not sure how that could work though. Without such magic, returning Vec<T> seems better since it is more general, but then I have the philosophical objection. Sigh.\n\nSo, that was a long-winded way of saying 'I don't know'.\n",

    "body": "The way I see it, the only time a `~[T]` will have any positive effect is when storing many of them in a (mostly) immutable recursive data type (e.g. Rust's AST), so the memory savings of going from 3 words to 2 are significant. For maximum effect, this also requires a length 0 `~[T]` can have no allocation (i.e. be `(NULL, 0)`).\n\nOf course the philosophical objects remain.\n\n---\n\nOne way to think of this would be flipping it around: if we _only_ had `Vec` and then added in a new `~[T]` type, would we go through and convert return values from `Vec` to `~[T]` in instances  where the callers \"normally\" don't need to modify the `Vec`?\n\nI would think that we wouldn't do that (because makes the function slower, due to needing a shrink-to-fit to return, and penalises those cases when the caller does want to modify it), and that  we would only change things to `~[T]` in places like the AST.\n",
