  "body": "It was required to get iOS compilable but since\nthat time a couple of changes were introduced\nwhich cause the same bug to re-appear and broke \nbuild anyway. Fixing all of them doesn\u2019t look a \nviable alternative to me as it will pollute the \ncode too much.\n\nSo it should be fixed from LLVM side and I hope \nLLVM will upstream corresponding changes in a \nmonth.\n\nMeanwhile, who wants to play with Rust on iOS is \nbetter to use a fork which uses patched LLVM:\nhttps://github.com/vhbit/rust/tree/ios . It may \nlag behind master a bit, but it is Travis-checked \nto compile successfully.\n",
