    "body": "> A solution would be to include the methods each trait provides on the page. Or to have the trait list it's provided methods directly.\n\nI think what you're asking for here is for types which satisfy some blanket impl (like `impl<A, I: DoubleEndedIterator<A>> DoubleEndedIteratorExt<A> for I`) to include methods available on that trait: in this case listing `DoubleEndedIteratorExt` methods on types which implement `DoubleEndedIterator` due to the blanket impl. There's already an issue for this here: #19394\n",

    "body": "I disagree. When working on the compiler or rustdoc, for example, you often need to get an instance of some type out of a cache stored in the private field of a context struct somewhere, usually by calling a free function. Many of my efforts in rustdoc were stymied because while I knew I needed something of type Foo (or worse, a type parametrized by Foo), I didn't have an effective way to pare down the enormous search space of rustc's free functions by their return type (grepping the source was sometimes helpful, but the point of a documentation tool is to bring stuff like that at hand.) The same problem is there for iterator structs.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\nSent from Mailbox\n\nOn Sat, May 16, 2015 at 10:31 AM, Gulshan Singh notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> ## The iterator problem is a bit different than the general problem, because with most other objects the methods to create them are defined the struct `impl` itself.
