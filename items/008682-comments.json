    "body": "1. The way I see it, the point of saying that `for` is sugar here is precisely to point out that it can go through any array as iterator which isn't common on today's most used programming languages (afaik).\n2. I like to use it for semantic purposes (eq. to >= or <= operators in C). A good compromise would be removing the example but still mentioning it in the parenthesis (through the example shows that it has to be imported, useful for the newbie willing to get started fast).\n",
