    "body": "I exported Sha1/Sha2 as extra::{Sha1,Sha2} instead of extra::crypto::{Sha1,Sha2} only because as best as I could tell, that was what was being done in other places in libextra / libstd. Longer term it does seem like as there are more functions implemented, exporting them all together under extra::crypto (or something similar) would be easier to maintain than exporting them all in the main namespace.\n\nWhen I created the Digest trait, I left the md4 code alone simply because its current implementation can't support the Digest trait I created - the md4 code wants to process an entire message at a time, while the Digest trait specifies an interface to process chunks of a message. I didn't want to bundle the md4 code alongside the Sha1/Sha2 code until they supported the same traits. Updating the md4 code to support processing a message incrementally and implement the same traits as Sha1/Sha2 sounds like a great idea to me.\n\nThere are a wide variety of different cryptographic functions that I would imagine would be nice to have in libextra some day: symmetric ciphers, asymmetric ciphers, message authentication codes, key derivation functions, key agreement protocols, etc. I think the question is how to organize it all. A few options I can think of (and there are probably more):\n1. Put each specific implementation directly into the crypto sub-module - extra::crypto::Sha1, extra::crypto::Aes, etc.\n2. Group each type of function into its own sub-module of extra - extra::digest::_; extra::symmetriccipher::_, extra::mac::*, etc\n3. Group each type of function into its own sub-module of crypto - extra::crypto::digest::_; extra::crypto::symmetriccipher::_, extra::crypto::mac::*, etc\n\nPersonally, I think I prefer #3, though, there are pros and cons for every approach.\n\nAnother question that doesn't seem to have a widely agreed upon answer is what to call a function like Sha2 - a Hash or a Digest. Personally, I prefer Digest since I think the term hash function is a bit ambiguous: If someone says \"hash function,\" does that mean a hash function suitable for use with a hash table or a hash function suitable for securing communication?\n\nWell, those are my initial thoughts. I don't really feel too strongly about anything above, though. I'm fairly new to Rust, so, I'm not sure if any particular options are more appropriate for Rust style than others.\n",

    "body": "md4: OK I did not realize the Digest interface meant it had to be able to process messages in chunks. Makes sense.\n\nRegarding naming, Digest IMO is ok, but as said above though crypto can be misleading if we shove all sorts of hashing algorithms in there. Older/simpler algorithms with known vulnerabilities should not be treated as cryptographically secure, and labeling crypto sort of infers that. \n\nAs for the grouping, I think I would favor 1 because having to remember what group the algorithm you want to use belongs to can be a pain and isn't very developer-friendly.\n\nI am also very new to rust, but I would be happy to help with this if the core folks set a direction.\n",

What other options are there?\n\nIf the goal is the name the module structure to differentiate broken algorithms from non-broken ones, how do we handle something like Sha1? Sha1 is considered broken for use in digital signatures, but, I think, is still considered secure for its use in HMAC functions: http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/sha1_broken.html. That article is old, but, I couldn't find anything newer. Regardless, even if that no longer applies to Sha1, how can the module structure handle an algorithm that is insecure for one purpose but secure for another?\n\nSha2 is generally considered to still be secure. So, it would got in a module indicating that its secure. But, what happens if Sha2 is broken next week? Does it get moved to a new module to indicate that its no longer secure? That would brake any applications that are making use of the algorithm.\n",
