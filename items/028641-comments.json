    "body": "It looks like `LC_MAIN` was introduced in 10.8 but our nightlies are compatible with (and built on) 10.7 so they don't use it. Note that we don't actually do anything special here, we just get whatever the linker spits out by default. E.g. an executable produced on 10.10 for me uses `LC_MAIN` as I presume you'd expect.\n",
