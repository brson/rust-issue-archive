    "body": "@kemurphy \n\n> at the time those are expanded there's no way to associated an enum's type name with its variants\n\nWhat do you mean? Deriving knows what the variants of the enum it's deriving for are. And even if it can't ask for the actual discriminant values, all it needs is the AST to figure out which variant is smallest or largest.\n\n> That is the most hilariously unfriendly snippet given the task it's trying to accomplish.\n\nHow is that unfriendly? That's precisely how you'd handle the same enum in C. The classic C solution doesn't need this because the classic C solution has the enums start at 0, but that's not always the case. I've certainly seen C code that looks something like\n\n``` C\nenum {\n    SECTION_A_START = 0x100,\n    A1 = SECTION_A_START,\n    A2,\n    A3,\n    SECTION_A_END = A3,\n\n    SECTION_B_START = 0x200,\n    B1 = SECTION_B_START,\n    B2,\n    B3\n    SECTION_B_END = B3\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nand it needs the same solution to count the number of elements in a given section.\n\nBasically, your `num_variants()` solution works _only_ when the C-like enum starts at 0. It's unusable otherwise. I explained this before, but you've chosen to completely ignore that.\n",

    "body": "@kemurphy \n\n> Countable being a super-trait of Bounded though is still wrong\n\nOnly if `count()` is defined in terms of `Bounded`. I'm suggesting something like\n\n``` rust\npub trait Countable : Bounded {\n    fn count() -> uint;\n}\n```\n\nThere could be a default implementation like\n\n``` rust\npub trait Countable : Bounded {\n    fn count() -> uint {\n        let min: Self = Bounded::min_value();\n        let max: Self = Bounded::max_value();\n        max - min + 1\n    }\n}\n```\n\nwhich would then be reimplemented for the types that actually do have holes, but I don't know if that's actually a good idea. It would mean that, for a type without holes, you can implement it using `impl Countable for Foo {}` as long as you already implemented `Bounded`, but whether or not that's a good idea, I can't answer.\n\nThe only real issue with `Countable` (besides the fact that it's a once-off trait) is the fact that it cannot be implemented on `uint` or `u64`, because the count would overflow (even if it's defined to return `u64`, this would still be a problem). This is actually why I think it might not be a great idea, and why it might be better simply to have `Bounded` and let you calculate the count yourself (which would only work for types without holes). Alternatively, `Countable` could just not be implemented on the numeric primitives (after all, it's not particularly useful there). But then it would be a libstd trait that has zero implementing types in libstd, which seems pretty odd.\n",

    "body": "I think the most reasonable way to think about `Countable` is in terms of my hypothetical trait that provides `next()`/`prev()`, where `count()` returns the number of values that can be returned from this trait. Or to put it another way, if you call `.next()` on `Bounded::min_value()` `count-1` times you'll get a value, but calling it `count` times will return `None`. This definition actually does provide a precise answer for how you'd implement it on `f32` (although that doesn't mean it _should_ be implemented on `f32`, I think that's rather pointless). Granted, there's no way to provide a default implementation given this definition. Also, it occurs to me that my suggested default impl using `Bounded` doesn't work either because you can't coerce arbitrary `Bounded` values to `uint` (it works in a concrete impl for a C-like enum because you can cast enum variants to `uint`).\n",

Your suggestion only makes sense if I need to be able to count the variants of a C-like enum I don't control, and I don't think that's a case that's worth adding an intrinsic for (it's the same limitation as needing to compare variants of an enum you don't control, etc. Enums meant for external use should derive all the properties that make sense).\n",

    "body": "Let's please remember to keep the code of conduct in mind when discussing PRs. Especially these two points:\n\n> - Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.\n> - Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.\n\nThe intrinsics interface will forever be unstable and we reserve the right to remove an intrinsic at any time. This is why any officially supported intrinsic is reexported or exposed through a different location (such as `mem::init` instead of `intrinsics::init`). With that in mind, I generally think that there's a pretty low bar for entry in intrinsics, but as with everything it's best not to make everything an intrinsic. I would be hesitant to reexport this intrinsic as-is under `std::reflect` without more discussion.\n\nIt does sound like `Bounded` would suffice pretty well here. It wouldn't handle arbitrary enums, but it sounds like with the relevant use cases for knowing the limits you're already in control of the enum. I'd want to think twice about going all out on generality, I think we've found it works out better with less generality (if acceptable) in most cases due to some difficulty with documentation and such.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I'm curious as to why you think Bounded fits here?  The whole point of this intrinsic is to avoid having to manually count the number of variants in the enum.  It sounds like a `#[deriving(Bounded)]` would get the job done for my use case (albeit with a little ugliness) for C-like enums with no holes, but that solution just doesn't feel like the right answer to me.  Also without the intrinsic there's no other way to reflect on an arbitrary enum like this.\n\nAnother use case I thought of earlier involves an enum you have no control over.  This example is a little contrived but I can think of cases like Multiboot 2 request/response tags where it actually may apply.\n\n``` rust\n// in another crate\npub struct Shape {\n    Circle(uint),\n    Rectangle(uint, uint),\n    Triangle(uint, uint, uint),\n}\n\n// collect the shapes and be ready to hand back by shape\nstruct ShapeCollector {\n    shapes: Vec<Vec<Shape>>\n}\n\nimpl ShapeCollector {\n    fn new() {\n        StructCollector {\n            shapes: Vec::with_capacity(NUM_SHAPES)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere `Bounded` doesn't really make much sense and without an intrinsic or some sort of default impl for all enum types you would need to keep NUM_SHAPES manually in sync with the library.\n",

I don't think we should keep breaking down parametric polymorphism beyond size and alignment. Leaving it as `unsafe` with no safe wrapper works, but it would be nicer to have a safe wrapper via a bound. This `std::reflect` stuff makes bounds on generics pretty meaningless... other than that I have no problem with this specific feature.\n",

Why is `num_variants()` special enough that it should be derived for all C-like enums but e.g. `Eq` is not?\n\nAs for your example code, I still disagree that `num_variants()` is wrong. Using `num_variants()` to fill the capacity makes the implicit assumption that the number of buckets used elsewhere in the code is equal to the number of variants, but the code elsewhere does not make that assumption explicit. Nor do I trust that the rest of the code is even making that particular assumption. What if a `Square(uint)` variant is added, but the `ShapeCollector` decides that `Square`s are actually just a special case of `Rectangle`? You'd have 4 variants but `ShapeCollector` would still only be using 3 buckets.\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that `ShapeCollector` needs to map each `Shape` to some other type to use as the bucket key. For example, a `uint`. It can't just use the variant directly because you can have multiple `Circle`s that are distinct (because of the variant fields). The place where this mapping of `Shape -> uint` is performed is what defines how many buckets there are (and it does so by defining how many unique `uint` values it produces). That place is what should also explicitly provide the number of buckets, which makes your code look like\n\n``` rust\nimpl ShapeCollector {\n    fn new() {\n        ShapeCollector {\n            shapes: Vec::with_capacity(ShapeCollector::num_buckets())\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd `ShapeCollector::num_buckets()` has no reason to use `num_variants()`.\n\nOr to be even more explicit, maybe it doesn't map it to `uint` but instead it maps it to your own\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(Countable)]\nenum ShapeBucket {\n    CircleBucket,\n    RectangleBucket,\n    TriangleBucket\n}\n```\n\nwhich lets you use `#[deriving]` all you want.\n",

That does make more sense.\n\n.... But we could argue about tasteful use cases all day -- I'd rather at this point just focus on discussion of this particular patch, which aims to solve a reflection problem that is otherwise unsolvable.  At this point you've expressed your opinion that you find it undesirable; I respect that, but it would be nice if we could un-derail this discussion and get back to constructive feedback.  I would like to see what the rest of the interested parties have to say.\n\n@dobkeratops: rust makes no guarantees about the layout of an enum at runtime, but perhaps a special TaggedUnion deriving would be handy.\n\nA while back I proposed syntax like the following, but nobody seemed to think it was a good idea:\n\n``` rust\nenum CCompatTaggedUnion {\n    Tag1 { data: *u8, len: uint } = TAG1_DISR,\n    Tag2 { data: u32 } = TAG2_DISR,\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nPerhaps something like that or a `#[disr=TAG1_DISR]` attribute or something would be useful in tandem with a TaggedUnion trait?  I'm bikeshedding here and it really isn't relevant to this PR but yeah.\n",

I expect that implementing `#[deriving(Bounded)]` is non-controversial (for C-like enums at least, though non-C-like would work if all fields implement `Bounded` too). And once it's done, then adding my proposed `.next_value()`/`.prev_value()` trait or the `Countable` trait will make more sense.\n\nAs a side note, if we do implement `#[deriving(Bounded)]` then I think at least the description has to change.

    "body": "@kemurphy In a dense C-like enum, calculating the number of variants is identical to calculating the bounds.\n\nRegarding C-like enums with holes:\n\n> You lose the ability to count the variants unless you know where the holes are.\n\nTrue. But is this a use-case that matters right now?\n\n> Bounded implies the type can take any value between min and max, whereas an enum with holes only takes a subset of those.\n\nI disagree. `Bounded` only implies that the type has bounds. It says nothing about whether the type is dense. And in fact I don't think it even makes sense to talk about holes in a `Bounded` type, because you haven't defined what a hole is. It certainly isn't a representable value that's missing from the type, because by definition, if it's missing from the type, it's not representable. We can talk about holes in a C-like enum because we're actually talking about the discriminant value, which has a larger range than the enum does. But that only holds for C-like enums.\n\nConsider the type `u32`. You would say it has no holes. I might say it can represent the value `1` and the value `2`, but not the value `1.5`, therefore it has holes. In fact, by this logic, it has a hole in between every single representable value. I hope you agree that this is a rather absurd way of defining holes, but it's actually what we're doing when talking about C-like enums.\n\nFor reference, I think `Bounded` should be implemented on `char`. When interpreted as a `u32`, `char` is considered to have holes, but when you consider `char` by itself (and not as a specialized `u32`) then the idea of a hole disappears.\n\nI guess to make it clearer, the concept of a hole in a type only exists if you also have the concept of addition with that type. You can then define holes as addition operations that result in illegal values (either wrapping or saturating on overflow, to avoid that being considered a hole). But of course addition isn't defined for C-like enums (by default).\n",

    "body": "@kemurphy Basically what I'm trying to say is, I think `#[deriving(Bounded)]` is a non-controversial solution to your concrete issue. I think `#[deriving(Countable)]` is a more elegant solution, but is perhaps more controversial. What I'm pushing for right now is to go ahead and do `#[deriving(Bounded)]` and to live with the uglier code for the time being, and to consider the more elegant `Countable` + whatever trait has `.next_value()`/`.prev_value()` as something to do later.\n\nGranted, if you can get buy-in to do `#[deriving(Countable)]` right now, then that's fine. I just think it's not as clearly correct (mostly because we don't have the trait at the moment, and nothing in `libstd` would even use it).\n",

    "body": "Associated values is the real solution here, so you can just say `Foo::NUM_VALUES`. But we don't support that. (I believe this associated value would still need to be `#[derive(..)]`d, presumably by declaring it on some trait).\n\nUntil such time as we get associated values, I think trying to emit a static is a bad API.\n\nSo right now, I think the best solution is the trait that returns `&[T]`. But the question of naming is a tough one. Maybe something like\n\n``` rust\npub trait EnumValues {\n    fn enum_values() -> &'static [Self];\n}\n```\n\nAlthough since this only works for C-like enums, it would be nice to put `CLike` in the name. But I think `CLikeEnumValues` is just a bit too unwieldy.\n",
