  "body": "The lexer already ignores CRLF in between tokens, but it doesn't\nproperly handle carriage returns inside strings and doc comments. Teach\nit to treat CRLF as LF inside these tokens, and to disallow carriage\nreturns that are not followed by linefeeds. This includes handling an\nescaped CRLF inside a regular string token the same way it handles an\nescaped LF.\n\nThis is technically a breaking change, as bare carriage returns are no\nlonger allowed, and CRLF sequences are now treated as LF inside strings\nand doc comments, but it's very unlikely to actually affect any\nreal-world code.\n\nThis change is necessary to have Rust code compile on Windows the same\nway it does on Unix. The mozilla/rust repository explicitly sets eol=lf\nfor Rust source files, but other Rust repositories don't. Notably,\nrust-http cannot be compiled on Windows without converting the CRLF line\nendings back to LF.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
