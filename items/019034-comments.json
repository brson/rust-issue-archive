    "body": "Hm this is interesting! The problem here is that `#[deriving]` adds the trait as a bound to any type parameters, so even though `Arc<T>` implements `Clone` for all `T`, the `#[deriving]` implementation still adds the `Clone` bound on the impl that it generates.\n\nIf you remove the `Clone` bound (by writing the impl manually), then the error will go away. I believe that the error happens at the callsite because that's the point at which the type parameter `T` is known. The impl itself is valid, you just can't call it because the `DontCloneMe` type doesn't implement `Clone` (not matching the impl).\n\nI'm going to close this as working as intended for now, but thanks for the report!\n",
