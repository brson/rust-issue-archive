I'm still very new to rust, and it took me hours to figure out the problem, mostly because the error message I get is very misdirecting:\n\n```\n  mymod.js:6:3: 6:4 error: an inner attribute is not permitted in this context\n  mymod.js:6 #![feature(phase)]\n```\n\nI strongly recommend a better error message, if at all possible, so you don't lose new people to the community.\n\nMy code was something like this:\n\n```\n/**\n * My mod\n */\n\n// For log related macros:\n#![feature(phase)]\n#[phase(syntax, link)] extern crate log;\n\nfn main() {\n  error!(\"We have logging!\");\n}\n```\n",

[A smaller example](http://is.gd/ZD6DKu):\n\n```\n/**\n * If you remove this comment, the compiler error will go away.\n * It's not very clear from the error message what the problem is.\n */\n\n#![feature(phase)]\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"hi\");\n}\n```\n\nFrom #4106:\n- [?] [Original example fails with a similar confusing error as originally reported](http://is.gd/EdPr56), that is, it's not clear that the comment is the problem, it just says \"expected one of `const`, `extern`, `fn`, `type`, or `unsafe`, found `}`\"\n- [x] [Trailing empty doc comment](http://is.gd/1RgDfW) fails with the clear error message \"expected item after doc comment\"\n\nSo it looks like there are still some less-than-ideal cases, and that the fix would be a better error message indicating that there was a doc comment in an unsupported location? Is that correct?\n\nIf so, where would one start looking to go about making the error message better for the remaining cases?\n",
