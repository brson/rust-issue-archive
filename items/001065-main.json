  "body": "I have no idea how this worked before at all, or why this was occuring on my Fedora machine the way it was. Running `make check` did not turn up this error, only running `make check -j3` did - which revealed `context.h` trying to include `valgrind/memcheck.h`, while the source has its own copy.\n\nThis was hidden behind a `HAS_VALGRIND`, which was definitely triggered _somehow_ - because I had `valgrind-devel` installed on my machine, and GCC 4.6, `context.h` was pulling it in and the build was failing due to the old issue #350. If I removed `valgrind-devel` and ran the build with `make check -j3`, GCC would complain it couldn't find `valgrind/memcheck.h`. But `make check` always works?!?!?!\n\nEither way, it's dead now.\n",
