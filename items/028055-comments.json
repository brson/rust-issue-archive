    "body": "Supertraits: from the [reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html):\n\n> Trait bounds on `Self` are considered \"supertraits\". These are\n> required to be acyclic.  Supertraits are somewhat different from other\n> constraints in that they affect what methods are available in the\n> vtable when the trait is used as a [trait object](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#trait-objects).\n\nThe issue (elaboration) - this is part of the trait-system and mostly documented by the code comments. The thing is that we don't want too many bounds to be implicitly available for functions, as this can lead to fragility with distant changes causing functions to stop compiling. There are basically 3 kinds of bounds available to a function:\n- bounds from explicit where-clauses - e.g. `T: B` when you have that clause. This includes the \"semi-explicit\" `Sized` bound.\n- bounds from supertraits of explicit where-clauses - a where-clause adds bounds for its supertraits (as `trait B: A`, the `T: B` bound adds a `T: A` bound).\n- bounds from the lifetime properties of arguments (outlives/implicator/implied bounds). These are only lifetime bounds, and irrelevant for the current problem. rust-lang/rfcs#1214 involved them a great deal.\n\nIf your bound isn't in the list, you will have to add it explicitly if you want to use it. I guess this should be a FAQ entry.\n",
