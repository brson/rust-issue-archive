Also I think keeping asm! as close to LLVM's inline asm is preferable for now, so that a higher-level wrapper can be designed on top of it later.\n\nI had a look at the LLVM code, and it seems that it's not just \"+m\" that isn't supported, \"+\" isn't supported in the constraint string at all. This means that any code currently using \"+\" constraints is broken and is simply working by luck (LLVM seems to just ignore invalid constraints and pick an arbitrary register).\n",
