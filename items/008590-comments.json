    "body": "This looks pretty good to me, I don't totally agree with `word_iter` => `whitespace_split_iter` but I've seen discussion happening on that so I figure that was the consensus at least.\n\nIt took me a second to figure out why you split the iterators into two structs, and it's kinda unfortunate that we have to. I suppose that `&fn` being cloneable is something that'll have to wait until the future. Could a comment be added explaining why there are separate structs instead of one? Probably a good idea to have some explanation because we don't want that to be the trend.\n\nCould you also add some comments how the iterators are implemented? These would just be for the implementation details that most people wouldn't need to see, but it'd be nice to easily read that the `&'self str` field is actually just the rest of the string to be iterated over.\n\nOther than that, nice job and nice speed improvements! \n",

    "body": "Thanks for the comments!\n\nWe could leave `word_iter` in place, but tag it \"for later improvement\".\n\nI didn't really mind another struct and Iterator implementation, `CharIterator` is the default iterator for str after all (and I think this PR has the two Char/CharOffset nicely factored into pieces), but I suppose there could be other ways to solve it. A `FilterMapStatic` using a function pointer instead of `&fn` would resolve clonability of `.byte_iter()` and `.iter()` too.\n\nDo you think the right thing to do is _don't solve clonability_ now, but wait for later?\n",
