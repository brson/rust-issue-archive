    "body": "Well, there is actually the issue that both `range` and `range_rev` are implemented in terms of `range_step`, which is easy right now because they both traverse a range of the form `[x, y)`.  If we make this change, it might be easier to make things work if they are implemented atop a function that traverses a range of the form `[x,y]`, rather than having to handle such different cases of `[x,y)` and `(x,y]` within a single routine.  (I.e. generate the inclusive limit value `y` from the original `stop` by subtracting `step` from `stop`.)  Or maybe this is a bad idea overall.\n",
