    "body": "Oh, this is possible due to our handling of \"small\" aggregates, e.g. `Option<i32>` (as used in the code above) is packed into a single `i64`, and LLVM seemingly doesn't like that. Changing `0` to `0i64` makes the code fold properly.\n\nThe implementation of `Range::next` is\n\n``` rust\n        if self.start < self.end {\n            let mut n = &self.start + &A::one();\n            mem::swap(&mut n, &mut self.start);\n            Some(n)\n        } else {\n            None\n        }\n```\n\nwhich appears in the given code: the first `cmpl` is the first line, the `setl`/`movzbl` are conditionally adding one to `self.start` forcibly making this non-conditional by moving the contents out of the `if` also folds correctly, i.e. the compiler is being too smart for its own good and trying to avoid a branch overly eagerly.\n\n``` rust\n        let mut n = &self.start + &A::one();\n        mem::swap(&mut n, &mut self.start);\n        if self.start < self.end {\n            Some(n)\n        } else {\n            None\n        }\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this transformation will mean that calling `next` yielding `None` enough times will cause the iterator to restart at 0 (if debug assertions are off).\n\ncc @dotdash \n",

    "body": "FWIW, changing `next()` in the generated IR to return `{ i32, i32 }` instead of `i64` (like we did in the past) does not allow the optimization to happen with the current pass setup. Only after another run of `opt -O2` we get the optimal result. So given that the iterator protocol allows for the implementation that optimizes well, I think we should use that. You want to compare against `n` in the `if` condition though, otherwise you get an off-by-one error.\n",
