    "body": "I presented a toy example on irc of how one might still be able to construct an @ graph with a cycle and huonw thought it might be relevant. Note that the example has to use an `Option<@Foo>` because the compiler prohibits `struct Foo{ other: @Foo }`. This makes sense; one could not safely initialize such a type. However one can do so unsafely (with a technique similar to the one shown below) and the resulting struct should be safe to use after initialization. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for the compiler to merely warn for such structs rather than forbidding them entirely?\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo {\n  name: ~str,\n  other: Option<@Foo>\n}\n\nfn circle(s:~str) -> @Foo {\n  unsafe {\n    let f = @Foo{ name:s, other:None};\n    let x = Some(f);\n    std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping_memory::<Option<@Foo>>(std::unstable::intrinsics::transmute(&f.other), &x, 1);\n    f\n  }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let f = ~circle(~\"Hi\");\n  println(f.name);\n  println(f.other.get().name);\n  println(f.other.get().other.get().name);\n}\n```\n\nThe program prints 'Hi' three times. Exciting.\n",

My reasoning is that in order to convert from mutable to immutable soundly, you need `~` pointers. So the idea would be to build up your data structure and then switch it from `~` to `@`. But when I try to write up examples this doesn't quite work as well as I thought. Maybe there is a way to make some unsafe helper fn that can simultaneously convert from `~` to `@` and do the assignments, I don't know. Have to think on it.\n",
