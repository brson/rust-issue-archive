  "body": "This PR contains some code cleanup and the fix for issue #8670.\n~~I am not sure about issue #8442 (could not reproduce it). @jdm, could check after this is merged and possibly close the issue then?~~ (closed now)\n\nSome interesting facts: With this commit, it should be possible to compile libstd with `-Zdebug-info` (it does not work yet with `-Zextra-debug-info` but we are getting there). Switching debug info on increases the compile time for libstd by about 2 seconds.\n\n@catamorphism I get one failing test in rustpkg:\n`package_script_with_default_build` says: `task <unnamed> failed at 'Couldn't copy file', /home/mw/rust/src/librustpkg/tests.rs:689`\nWould you have any idea what that is about? Seems be something wrong on my machine...\n\nCheers,\nMichael\n\nFixes #8670\n",
