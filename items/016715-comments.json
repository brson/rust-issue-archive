    "body": "> The Rust type `int` is a two's complement signed integer type with target-machine-dependent size. Its size, in bits, is equal to the size of the rust type uint on the same target machine.\n\n\u2013 Rust Reference Manual (2014-09-17)\n\nThis is the only thing I see that specifies `int`. I see no guarantee that `int` is the same as any other integer type, so I don't see where it follows that `int` is at least 8 bit long. I also see no guarantee why an array can't have the size as size that doesn't fit into an `int`, for example `int::MAX as uint + 1` as that's completely addressable using pointer arithmetic using `uint`, yet is too big for `int`.\n",
