  "body": "Revert map.each to something which takes two parameters rather than a tuple.  The current setup iterates over `BaseIter<(&'self K, &'self V)>` where 'self is a lifetime declared _in the `each()` method_.  You can't place such a type in the impl declaration.  The compiler currently allows it, but this will not be legal under #5656 and I'm pretty sure it's not sound now.  It's too bad that maps can't implement `BaseIter` (at least not over a tuple as they do here) but I think it has to be this way for the time being.\n\nr? @thestinger\n",
