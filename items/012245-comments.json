    "body": "Marvelous tests, amazing design, nice job!\n\nThe only major comment I have is that if you `use Bar;` then you get the error message at the location of `use Bar;`, not the usage of the private `Bar`. This seems a little odd because the error message isn't quite accurate. The error message could in theory say whether it's private in which namespace, but I don't think that'd be too useful either because most shouldn't have to know about the two namespaces.\n\nI think that we definitely want to land this at least as-is because it fixes the backwards-compatibility issues. Error messages can always be refined later down the road. I think something like this could be fixed with a side table mapping paths to the imports they were resolved with, but at some point this is also diminishing returns because this is a fairly rare use case anyway.\n\nSo, two things:\n1. What do you think about reporting the error at the path vs the import?\n2. If we leave as-is, could you tag the location with a `FIXME` and open an issue about it?\n\nAgain, awesome work!\n",

    "body": "The reason the error messages are a bit wrong is that I didn't want the def map to point at two things for imports - I thought that would be too irregular. But that means we don't really know if we are pointing at a type or a value in privacy.rs and so we sometimes get a slightly wrong error message. In other words, although the privacy information is aware of namespaces, the definition information is not. So when we rely on the latter we get incomplete/incorrect info. This only happens for error messages, so I didn't think it was breaking a major assumption about definitions for.\n1. I prefer to leave the error message on the import rather than the use of the import because the actual error is with the import - it is the import referring to something which is private, not the path - which is referring to the import which is public.\n2. So, I think the thing to fix is the error messages - I can certainly do those things if you agree this is what should be fixed.\n",
