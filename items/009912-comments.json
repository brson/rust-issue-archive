The rough point was to permit structs to extend other structs and to permit traits to extend a struct as well. If one struct S extends another struct T, then S is a substruct of T, and &S is a subtype of &T (as well as ~S <: ~T). S begins with all the fields of T. If a trait extends a struct S, it must be implemented by the struct S or some substruct of S. \n",

If you have an `&IElement`, you can access its `Element` fields directly, and `setAttribute` will be called 'virtually'. Forwarding to the \"base class\" implementation is an interesting question: I guess it might work by casting `self` to the appropriate ancestor type, then calling the method? But I'll defer to others here.\n",

    "body": "Unfortunately I have a counterproposal.\n\nI was thinking about how subtype relationships might be precisely specified, as well as potential subtype relationships between some built-in types, and along the way stumbled into the realization that we might be better served by a plan modelled after GHC's [Coercible](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.8.1-rc1/html/libraries/base-4.7.0.0/GHC-Exts.html#g:8).\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe first issue is that if you were to have `struct B: A { ... }`, the relationship between `B` and `A` is very different from the relationship between `&B` and `&A`. The latter two have exactly the same representation (so `&B` is a proper subtype of `&A`), but `B`'s representation only _starts with_ `A`. This is surprising to no one (it was covered in @nikomatsakis's blog post), but it's awkward _syntactically_: how do you distinguish the two in constraints? Both are valuable: `T` starts-with `U` implies, for instance, that `&T` may be safely transmuted to `&U`, while `T` is-a-proper-subtype-of `U` has stronger implications, for example that `&[T]` may be safely transmuted to `&[U]`.\n\nThe larger issue is that while we might think we want single inheritance and subtypes, what we actually want is safe zero-cost conversions between binary compatible types, of which subtypes induced by single inheritance are only a smallish subset.\n\nIt went like this. I was thinking: hmm... wouldn't it be nice if `[T, ..n]` were considered a subtype of `[T, ..m]`, provided `n > m`? And wouldn't it be nice if `(A, B, C)` were considered a subtype of `(A, B)`? And these seemed like interesting possibilities, but they made me a little bit uncomfortable. And then I realized that you also might like to coerce `&[T, ..n]` to `&T`, and to coerce between `T` and `[T, ..1]` and `(T,)` (the singleton tuple), and stipulating a subtype relationship of any sort between these is _plainly_ preposterous. I then realized that there's much, much more: including conversions between any two out of a type and any newtypes of that type, conversions between same-sized numeric types (like `int` and `uint`), and conversions which are akin to mass-borrowing, such as `&'s [~T]` to `&'s [&'s T]`. I then thought of GHC's `Coercible`, which does similar things.\n\nSo hopefully well-motivated, here's the plan.\n\n### Interface\n\nThe user-facing interface would be exposed as a trait and a function/method:\n\n```\ntrait Coercible<T> { }\n#[inline(always)]\nfn coerce<U, T: Coercible<U>>(x: T) -> U { unsafe { transmute(x) } }\n```\n\nThe trait would be wired-in to the compiler, and user-defined impls of it would be illegal. `coerce()` would coerce between any two types where the target type \"is a proper subtype of\" the input type. Note that `coerce` is never a virtual call, as it is not a method of `Coercible`: `Coercible<T>` doesn't have a vtable, and could be considered a built-in \"kind\" alongside `Freeze`, `Send`, etc.\n\nWhere single inheritance and subtyping conflate many different ideas, among them transparent access to superstruct fields, zero-cost conversion from sub- to supertypes, and these conversions being implicit/automatic, `Coercible` captures and exposes only the thing which is truly important: the zero-cost conversions, and for a much wider range of scenarios.\n\nThere would be another such wired-in trait which I'm going to call `HasPrefix`. `T: HasPrefix<U>` corresponds to `T` starts-with `U` from above, while `T: Coercible<U>` corresponds to `T` is-a-proper-subtype-of `U`.\n\n```\ntrait HasPrefix<T> { }\n```\n\nThe only reason `HasPrefix` is important is because it gives rise to `Coercible` relationships, as in the example above: `T: HasPrefix<U>` => `&T: Coercible<&U>`.\n\nThe most important aspect of the single inheritance proposal is that you could abstract over it, as with traits: traits could specify that they could only be implemented by structs inheriting a given struct, and therefore fields of that struct could be accessed through trait objects without any additional overhead. Here you could accomplish the equivalent by making `HasPrefix<Foo>` a supertrait of your trait. Perhaps more flexibly, if syntax allows, you could also put it in the \"kinds\" list: `&MyTrait:HasPrefix<Foo>`. Accessing fields of the struct would be syntactically noisier, as you would need to insert explicit calls to `coerce()`, but in performance terms it would be exactly the same. In general, anything you could express as substruct or subtype relationships in the single inheritance proposal could be expressed as `HasPrefix` and/or `Coercible` bounds, while the reverse is not true.\n\nIn terms of surface syntax, we could have a function or method like `coerce()` or `cast()` as I've been assuming above, or perhaps we could tie it into `as`. I prefer the former, because it allows the target type to be inferred, while still allowing it to be specified explicitly using type application, or once we gain type ascription anywhere, more ergonomically as `foo.cast(): TargetType`. \n\n### Implementation\n\nAs with GHC's Coercible (see previous link), these might not actually be implemented by having honest-to-god wired-in impls of them, but it's easier to explain if you pretend that they would. So pretend that things of the following nature would also be wired-in.\n\nFor any two types `A` and `B` out of a base type and any newtypes of it (meaning a struct with a single member), and also any two numeric types of the same size, and also any two zero-sized types:\n\n```\nimpl Coercible<A> for B { }\nimpl Coercible<B> for A { }\n```\n\nFor singleton arrays and their element:\n\n```\nimpl<T> Coercible<T> for [T, ..1] { }\nimpl<T> Coercible<[T, ..1]> for T { }\n```\n\nFor tuples of a given size with all elements of the same type, and fixed-length arrays of that size and type:\n\n```\nimpl<T, static N: uint> Coercible<[T, ..N]> for (T, T, .. times N) { } // fake syntax\nimpl<T, static N: uint> Coercible<(T, T, .. times N)> for [T, ..N] { }\n```\n\nFor any struct `B` and its first field `A` (single inheritance would be a subset of this single case!):\n\n```\nimpl HasPrefix<A> for B { }\n```\n\nFor tuples and longer tuples:\n\n```\nimpl<A, B, ..X, Y> HasPrefix<(A, B, ..X)> for (A, B, ..X, Y) { }\n```\n\nFor arrays and longer arrays:\n\n```\nimpl<T, static M: uint, static N: uint> where N > M HasPrefix<[T, ..M]> for [T, ..N] { }\n```\n\nThe following is for all types and their prefixes, and all generic types with covariant \"pointer-like\" type parameter contexts. It's what takes you from \"`U` is a substruct of `T`\" to \"`&U` is a proper subtype of `&T`\". I'm going to make this idea of a \"pointer-like\" context more precise in another RFC I'm working on, but for now let's just say that it's any generic type whose shallow in-memory representation is independent of the identity of `T`, such as pointer/reference types. Importantly, a type parameter of any type with a destructor would be considered invariant, which means that `~T` could not be coerced to `~U`, as desired. (I'm not sure if this is _precisely_ the right rule - are there type with destructors where we would want to permit it? Are there types without destructors where we wouldn't? - but it seems like a good first stab at the problem.)\n\n```\nimpl<U, T: HasPrefix<U>, R<covariant pointer-like context>> Coercible<R<U>> for R<T> { }\n```\n\nVice versa for contravariant contexts:\n\n```\nimpl<U, T: HasPrefix<U>, R<contravariant pointer-like context>> Coercible<R<T>> for R<U> { }\n```\n\nFor proper subtypes we can coerce across all covariant contexts, not just pointer-like ones, meaning for instance that we can can coerce a whole array at once (`&[T]` -> `&[U]`, with `R` = `&[]`):\n\n```\nimpl<U, T: Coercible<U>, R<covariant context>> Coercible<R<U>> for R<T> { }\n```\n\nAgain, vice versa for contravariant:\n\n```\nimpl<U, T: Coercible<U>, R<contravariant context>> Coercible<R<T>> for R<U> { }\n```\n\nNow some special-cased coercions for mass-borrowing. We can't directly coerce from `~T` to `&'s T` because we have no idea what `'s` should be, but it works if the whole thing is frozen for `'s` by an outer reference. I don't have the stamina right now to think through whether the converses would also be valid in the contravariant case (though I suspect they would). How to extend this to library-defined smart pointers is also left to future work.\n\n```\nimpl<'s,     T, R<covariant context>> Coercible<&'s R<&'s T>>         for &'s R<~T> { }\nimpl<'s,     T, R<covariant context>> Coercible<&'s mut R<&'s mut T>> for &'s mut R<~T> { }\nimpl<'s, 't, T, R<covariant context>> Coercible<&'s R<&'t T>>         for &'s R<&'t mut T> { }\n```\n\nReflexivity:\n\n```\nimpl<T> HasPrefix<T> for T { }\nimpl<T> Coercible<T> for T { }\n```\n\nTransitivity:\n\n```\nimpl<A, B: HasPrefix<A>, C: HasPrefix<B>> HasPrefix<A> for C { }\nimpl<A, B: Coercible<A>, C: Coercible<B>> Coercible<A> for C { }\n```\n\nWhew! That's all I could think of right now. Unlike GHC, we do _not_ have symmetry in general: a whole lot of conversions are in one direction only.\n\nAs in GHC, these make-believe impls are wildly overlapping and incoherent, but that doesn't matter, because we don't care which impl is selected (they have no vtable), only whether or not one exists. \n\nAnd also as in GHC, to preserve abstraction boundaries, as a general principle, for those impls which involve conversions between user-defined types, they would only \"be in scope\" when the means to do the conversion manually are in scope. This means that you could only cast `&Struct` to `&FirstFieldOfStruct` if the first field of the struct is visible to you, you could only cast `Foo` to `NewTypeOfFoo` if its constructor is visible, and other similar rules along these lines.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI believe this proposal would have many beneficial aspects. By jettisoning those parts of single inheritance and subtyping which are not truly important and concentrating on the ones which are, it would allow greater power and flexibility, while also hopefully allowing a simpler implementation which localizes the logic related to zero-cost conversions to a single part of the language, the built-in `Coercible` and `HasPrefix` traits (as opposed to every potential assignment, function call, etc. being subject to implicit subtyping rules). The drawback, which may also be seen as an advantage, is that coercions need to be explicitly invoked by the programmer. In exchange, the scope of possible coercions is far greater.\n",

    "body": "IMO, Single inheritance works very well in many common,wellknown situations - for a start I beleive its absence makes your AST code harder to navigate. (having it reduces naming& navigation effort and this is a REALLY big deal without an IDE).  Many node types would just derive from 'SpannedNode' etc, less having to remember 'which submember is this in' .. and with less reused names between different structs its easier to find the element in question.\n\nGiven that the feature seems simple i haven't worried about its absence - I know there are many conflicting demands for language features.. but I do worry if you proclaim that it isn't important or its 'never' :(\n\nI think it _does_ often work well for game entity layouts, and does work well for UI scene descriptiions aswell. So a programmer familiar with these patterns will find Rust code feels clunky :(\n    \"bullet.pos\" vs \"bullet.ent.frame.matrix.pos \" // arghh, its my most common property and now it has the longest name\n    \"bullet.radius\" vs \"bullet.ent.radius\" etc // ah which nesting level is that property at.. etc\n\nIt has a very simple low level representation - its possible to do single inheritance easily in ASM by just by reusing slot offsets ... so it makes sense for a low level language to represent it, IMO.\n\nYou still have the option of using composition where needed - its not like having the feature proclaims that programmers _must_ use inheritance hierarchies; and Rust already has superior ways of doing interfaces so I dont think having it will make Rust programmers suddenly succumb to poor OOP patterns or anything.\n",

    "body": "@dobkeratops an even simpler feature that would allow one to access fields (and maybe even methods) on super types is anonymous fields (if they mean what I think they mean - i.e. fields without a name, flattening their contents into the current structure).\n\nI have to disagree on the last paragraph, having a feature that makes certain patterns (much) nicer will draw new and old Rust programmers alike, causing them to resort to workarounds to keep their nice single inheritance working.\n\nMaybe my previous statement \"this feature will force the language into an expressiveness dead-end\" was exaggerated, but I still believe it can do harm.\n\nIn case anyone was confused by my decoherence - I _certainly_ want a feature which can model single inheritance nicely. But I also want it to support multiple inheritance, including layouts that aren't possible in C++, without any additional cost.\n\n**EDIT**: @Kimundi reminded me that [`Deref`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/12491) when [automatically applied](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/12610) can emulate single structural inheritance:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo {...}\nstruct Bar {\n    super: Foo,\n    ...\n}\n// This can even be done by a simple macro:\nimpl Deref<Foo> for Bar {\n    fn deref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a Foo {&self.super}\n}\nimpl DerefMut<Foo> for Bar {\n    fn deref_mut<'a>(&'a mut self) -> &'a mut Foo {&mut self.super}\n}\n```\n\nBut that doesn't allow multiple anonymous fields/inheritance, so I'm wary about overuse.\nAt least it's a hack and not a core language feature in and of itself.\n",

    "body": "@eddyb anonymous fields do not properly implement inheritance because they do not allow the supertype to invoke methods that are implemented on the subtype.\n\nTo see where the problem arises, let's start with a struct type and its paired interface. To gain cheap-ish (though not super cheap, a virtual call is still required) access to the fields, you can make the `TNode` type implement `Deref<SNode>`:\n\n```\nstruct SNode { ... }\ntrait TNode : Deref<SNode> { ... }\n```\n\nSo far so good. Now let's create a subtype `SElement`:\n\n```\nstruct SElement { node : SNode, ... }\nimpl Deref<SElement> for SElement { ... }\ntrait TElement : Deref<SElement> { ... }\n```\n\nNow we want to implement the virtual methods on `TNode` for `SElement`:\n\n```\nimpl TNode for SElement { ... }\n```\n\nNow we hit a problem! `SElement` already implements `Deref<SElement>`, and hence it cannot implement `Deref<SNode>` (this is of course dependent on the precise rules governing generic traits that we adopt, cc #5527, but I believe we must have a functional dependency with the `Deref` trait (and indeed any trait with methods) in order to keep the system making sense).\n",

(from the outside it looks like the class inherits multiple classes, though they're actually just inner objects).\nIt can be hidden from the user, as a simple implementation, or exposed to his heart's desires.\nAn example \"exposed\" syntax (just as inspiration)\n\n```\nwraps obj1\n    include *\n    exclude such_and_such, such2\n    rename method1 to meth1\nend\n```\n\nso basically those methods get generated, and the implementation is just a one liner, forwarding to the inner objects.\nin this way you get a simple implementation of pseudo multiple-inheritence.\nyou may need a few more adjustments, what I had in mind is how the eiffel language tackled the user api. \n",

Or is there a different way to approach this problem other than inheritance assuming we do not copy-paste the fields to each Git object type?\n\nEdit: it looks like we might be getting virtual structs.\n",

    "body": "Hello, newcomer here, I stumbled upon this thread recently. (It's top or one of the top Google results for queries the likes of \"rust inheritance\".)\n\nThere is some very interesting reading here, esp. by @nikomatsakis and @glaebhoerl . However,  both proposals make me uncomfortable. Both of them are quite complex and it's not immediately obvious what the use case would be like.\n\n@nikomatsakis 's proposal breaks the separation between traits and structs, which is something I've always regarded as a great virtue of Rust. Traits extending structs? IMHO it's a concept too reminiscent of `class` known from C++/Java/C#/... -type of languages.\n\n@glaebhoerl 's proposal introduces two new 'magical' (ie. compiler-special) traits, which by itself is not necessarily a bad thing, however I don't feel it's justified even by wider applicability. Do we _actually_ need to convert `[T, ..1]` to `T` via an explicit syntax rather than a different already-existing explicit syntax? The same thing applies to `[T, ..n]` \u2192 `[T, ..m]` coercion - don't we already have `slice` for that sort of thing?\n\n**Couldn't this be done in some kind of a KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) way?** I'm not sure I have enough theoretical foundation to propose a solution myself, so the following might be a complete nonsense, but I'm giving it a try anyway:\n\n`struct Foo: Bar {...}` defines a struct `Foo` inheriting struct `Bar` via following principles:\n1. layout-wise, `Foo` is the same as `Bar` with `Foo`-specific elements appended at the end.\n2. **All traits implemented for `Foo` are also automatically implemented for `Bar`.** In consequence, any `&Foo` could be used with the same traits as `&Bar`. Note that this actually _avoids_ the sort of relationships described by @glaebhoerl - `Foo` is, strictly speaking, in no way related to `Bar` and the same applies to `&Foo` and `&Bar`, the only relation is that they share implementation of traits. This also implies that there would be no casting between the two - see below for notes.\n\n**How would dynamic dispatch be done?** Since traits already provide that and they also already provide possibility for partial implementation (albeit somewhat limited) it would only make sense to use these features for dynamic dispatch in the context of inheritance. The only thing needed would be to allow partial re-implementations of traits that are defined for parent. Basically, when defining `impl` of a trait for a descendant, the `impl` of this trait for parent would be considered default for the `impl` for descendant.\n\n**No upcasting/downcasting? That's bad.** Well, there are pros and cons. For example, if you needed to create a vector of polymorphed objects, it would need to be `Vec<&BarTrait>` where `BarTrait` is a trait implemented for `Bar` (and consequently also `Foo`). The pros are:\n- Using traits like this is probably already fairly familiar with Rust programmers\n- There is no need for any special casting and casting-related magic whatsoever\n\nCons:\n- There always is a performance overhead of the vtable. It takes some pondering to tell how serious a problem this is. I've seen reports that a vtable lookup only takes an instruction or two tops (in C++, using GCC - frankly I don't know how many it is in Rust). Anyway, in cases where avoiding vtable lookup is necessary a custom-tailored solution might be used, it would probably not be that hard.\n- There is no downcasting. However, downcasting is pretty much just one of applications of RTTI, which I'd expect to rather be designed separately from inheritance (for the most part) along with a discussion whether it is really a useful thing in the first place.\n\nI'm well aware that this is a very simplistic approach and that I've probably overlooked a thing or twenty, so feel free to criticize anything :)\n\nRegardless, whatever approach ends up being featured in the language (if any), I'd be really glad if it:\n- Did not break the nice separation between structs and traits\n- Were simple enough to understand and use - for instance, rust-lang/rfcs#223 is IMHO _ridiculously_ complicated\n- Involved as few magical traits, functions, operators, etc. as possible (\"magical\" meaning with special behaviour defined by the compiler). Again, this is a reason why I really dislike rust-lang/rfcs#223 , as it involves 1 compiler directive, 1 global function and some 5 special types ... _Are they being serious!?_\n\nSo, yeah, that'd be my two cents..\n",
