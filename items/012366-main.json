  "body": "Fixes #12350.\n\nParentheses around assignment statements such as\n\n``` rust\nlet mut a = (0);\na = (1);\na += (2);\n```\n\nare not necessary and therefore an unnecessary_parens warning is raised when\nstatements like this occur.\n\nNOTE: In `let` declarations this does not work as intended. Is it possible that they do not count as assignment expressions (`ExprAssign`)? (edit: this is fixed by now)\n\nFurthermore, there are some cases that I fixed in the rest of the code, where parentheses could potentially enhance readability. Compare these lines:\n\n``` rust\na = b == c;\na = (b == c);\n```\n\nThus, after having worked on this I'm not entirely sure, whether we should go through with this patch or not. Probably a matter of debate. ;)\n",
