Thanks!\n\nHonestly, I haven't pondered the code in depth (too much bit twiddling), but I would be more confident with some accompanying tests, particularly a regression test for the issue you are fixing. You could add them to stdtest::io, probably using a string_reader.\n\nBeyond that I wonder why chars_from_buf gets so little reuse out of the str::\\* methods, since there are some there for parsing unicode.\n",
