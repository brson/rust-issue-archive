    "body": "> From the description I take it this doesn't suffer from the compile time problem mentioned in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21418#issuecomment-70925491?\n\nRight, I compared compile times for (IIRC) rustc_trans and rustc_typeck and there was no measureable difference in compile times with the assume in stage 2 (or maybe it was stage 1 that I tested, shouldn't matter).\n\nI also just bootstrapped a new version of #21418 and that took ~24 minutes from finishing stage0 libcore to finishing stage2 librustc. Considering that just rustc_trans took 13 minutes when the slowdown was there, it looks good to me ;-)\n\n>  (Out of interest what changed in LLVM?
