I don't get any similar error here and have no idea what might cause it.\n\nThe fix of completely removing `@` from the AST is what I described as the \"proper\" way to fix it. It's very hard however, while not much code relies on the sharing of `@` some does, and it's enough to make completely removing `@` very difficult.\n",
