    "body": "The ability to override these was never an intended feature. It was a consequence of the implementation avoiding an extension trait. It doesn't make sense to do an ad-hoc override of a method like `last` dozens of times when random access iterators are a general purpose concept. It's also not a workable solution for methods like `seek`. There are better ways to approach this issue, and it should probably go through the RFC process.\n",

The library I am interfacing with (leveldb) also provides no way to interface with the iterator in any other fashion then skipping to \"last\", so I just cannot build reusable methods there.\n\nThis means that I would have to implement a non-standard iterator at that place, loosing convenient access to `IteratorExt`.\n\nThe underlying problem is that I cannot provide a more specific implementation taking priority over the implementation for `A`.\n",
