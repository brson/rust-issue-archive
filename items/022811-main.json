  "body": "Ok, this was a hard one, and the description will also be somewhat long. We provide tools to tell what exact symbols to emit for any `fn` or `static`, but don\u2019t quite check if that won\u2019t cause any issues later on. Some of the issues include LLVM mangling our names again and our names pointing to wrong locations, us generating [dumb foreign call wrappers](https://gist.github.com/nagisa/8185783075626d98e094), linker errors, extern functions resolving to different symbols altogether (`extern {fn fail();} fail();` in some cases calling `fail1()`), etc. \n\nBefore the commit we had a function called `note_unique_llvm_symbol`, so it is clear somebody was aware of the issue at some point, but the function was barely used, mostly in irrelevant locations.\n\nI published this PR mainly as RFC, because I\u2019m not sure about approach taken here, and want to hear people\u2019s involved with trans thoughts in general.\n\nP.S. This is [breaking-change] because it makes dumbly written code (such as issue-15562.rs test) properly invalid.\nP.S.S. this in its current form fixes all those issues about #[no_mangle] on trait methods.\nP.S.S.S. were this PR received positively, I\u2019d like to clean it up some before merge.\n",
