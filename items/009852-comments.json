Therefore, if I have a static constant-expression that refer to the first `array`, it won't be affected by modifications made to its mutable copy.\n\nThis was more or less what wanted to achieve when I asked bstrie on IRC (which led to this bug report)\nBut I'm quite a beginner in Rust and maybe I'm missing some important point...\n\nEDIT: well, in fact, I'm realizing there's nothing specific with arrays here. There'is the same problem with any type providen that some static expression refers to another by pointer. Should'nt it be possible for the pointed value to be declared as mutable and modified, so that modifications will affect other static expressions pointing to it ?\n",
