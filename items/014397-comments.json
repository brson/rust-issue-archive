    "body": "@nikomatsakis r?\n\nThis needs another rebase already, but given that the last one took nearly a week, I wanted to get this up for review before I do that. I don't expect anything significant to change. It passes make check locally.\n\nIt is not worth looking at individual commits since the later ones change _a lot_ of what happens in earlier ones. But I haven't squashed them because I thought it might be informative to see the steps taken (at the coarsest level) to get to where I got to.\n\nWith these changes we do deep coercions in the sense of structs with value fields which get unsized to produce an unsized struct. But we don't yet do the deep coercions of pointers.\n\nThere are still a few special cases on vec/str vs unsized, these are mostly where traits are different. I hope these go away when I do the DST-ification of traits.\n",

    "body": "Q for @nick29581 : is `impl W for W { ... }` where `W` is a trait, is that part of DST?\n\n(My head still spins every time I look at a declaration like `impl W for W { ... }`, but I am under the impression that we do not want a trait T, when regarded as an unsized type, to automatically implement T.  Perhaps that impression is incorrect at this point.)\n\nHere is the example that I was trying to hack together when I encountered the \"need\" for `impl W for W { ... }`. \n\n``` rust\n#![allow(dead_code)]\n\nextern crate debug;\n\nfn main() {\n    struct Foo<type T> { x: int, y: T }\n    trait W for type { fn weight(&self) -> int; }\n    #[cfg(buggy)]\n    impl W for W {\n        fn weight(&self) -> int { (*self).weight() }\n    }\n    impl W for (int, int) {\n        fn weight(&self) -> int { self.val0() + self.val1() }\n    }\n    impl<type X:W> W for Foo<X> {\n        fn weight(&self) -> int { self.x + self.y.weight() }\n    }\n\n    let f : Foo<(int,int)> = Foo { x: 1i, y: (2i, 3i) };\n    let g : &Foo<(int, int)> = &f;\n    let h : &Foo<W> = g;\n    println!(\"h.y.weight(): {:?}\", h.y.weight());\n    println!(\"h.weight(): {:?}\", h.weight());\n}\n```\n\nWhen you compile without `--cfg buggy`, you get \"failed to find an implementation of trait main::W for main::W\". If you add `--cfg buggy`, you get:\n\n```\n% ./x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc --cfg buggy /tmp/h.rs && ./h\nerror: internal compiler error: unexpected failure\nnote: the compiler hit an unexpected failure path. this is a bug.\nnote: we would appreciate a bug report: http://doc.rust-lang.org/complement-bugreport.html\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace\ntask 'rustc' failed at 'get_base_type() returned a type that wasn't an enum, struct, or trait', /Users/fklock/Dev/Mozilla/rust-dstnrc/src/librustc/middle/typeck/coherence.rs:169\n```\n\ngist of the backtrace for the above: https://gist.github.com/pnkfelix/ad6cf810a87c2876cc57\n",
