It just seems to me that this question gets raised: if you can do it on an immutable variable, why can't you do it through an immutable reference of that variable?\n\nThx\n",

    "body": "This is expected behaviour. Rust (by default) only allows mutation when it can guarantee that the value being mutated is not accessible via any other path or reference. The compiler understands this for the local variable, because it knows that `my_ref` is the only instance, but this isn't true with the shared reference `&self` since there _can_ be many shared borrows.\n\nThanks for filing!\n",
