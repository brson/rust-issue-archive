    "body": "Wow, this one appears to be the combination of two separate issues:\n1. if a macro invocation is allowed to expand to a item/statement (rather than an expression), it is assumed to do so (https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/5941)\n2. a macro expanding to multiple items is silently truncated at the first one (https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/8012)\n\n#5921 means that, in `twice!($b) + 1`, the `twice!($b)` gets treated as a statement/item macro, and then #8012 means that the trailing `+ 1` gets dropped (and so the behaviour is incorrect, _and_ no error is reported).\n\nThis can be fixed by forcing the `twice!($b)` to be evaluated in an expression context (that is what is happening with the `1 + twice!($b)` form), which can be done with some parens:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! twice_one(\n    ($b:expr) => ( (twice!($b) + 1) );\n)\n```\n\n(Closing as a dup of those two issues.)\n",
