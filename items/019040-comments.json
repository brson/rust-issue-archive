    "body": "Moving response to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19040#commitcomment-8638674 out of the commit and onto the PR itself, so that notifications are sent out more generally.\n\n> I don't have time to read through all of the RFCs. \n\nIt does take a lot of time to keep up, I agree (though I find it much easier to track RFCs than individual PRs). What can I say, there's a lot going on!\n\n> It returning a value or having different buffering semantics would be a breaking change to the API.\n\nYes, I agree, and marking it stable is committing to not returning a value and performing buffering.\n\n> It doesn't just panic on I/O failure, it panics on broken pipes which is a completely normal part of *nix programming. Nearly every program used in shell pipelines has to cope with broken pipes when a program like head closes early.\n\nIt seems to me that panic is pretty reasonable (it's also what [other languages do](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c336dabafff816422297)). Programs that do not require fine-grained error handling (like many command-line utilities) can thus use `println!` and recover from the panic in order to terminate gracefully.\n\nIn any case, this discussion has come up numerous times before (e.g., [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/13824)). The arguments for/against have been made. I think it's time for this commit to move forward and this argument to be closed.\n",
