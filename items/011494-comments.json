    "body": "The example just below that piece of text is showing an immutable reference; a mutable reference would be created with `let z = &mut x;`.\n\nIn any case, while it's true that taking a mutable reference (e.g. `z` above) to a value stops mutation through any other pointer, it doesn't freeze the object: you can mutate it through `z`. However, the existence of any immutable reference stops all mutation, through any reference (or even directly mutating the object).\n",

    "body": "Though after reading your explanation makes it clear, the text is confusing as is. I believe the language, \"_Lending an immutable pointer_\" isn't clear to someone unfamiliar with Rust, like me, who is just learning the terminology, whereas \"_Taking an immutable reference_\" as @alexcrichton describes here is perfectly clear to me, and probably others coming from a C perspective.\n\nJust my 2 cents :)\n",
