I was a bit surprised to learn about `#![doc(test(no_crate_inject))]` as well, but in the grand scheme of things it's not necessarily such a bad attribute to stabilize in terms of future breakage. The failure mode is that the _doc tests_ for a crate _may_ fail (e.g. libstd just uses them to control lints), which may not be the worst in the world. Right now rustdoc is super lax about attributes and generally ignores anything that's malformed.\n",

Currently the `#[fundamental]` types are references, function traits, and `Box<T>`. Of these, the only ones rustdoc is interested in is references and `Box<T>`, and of those the only one with an actual `#[fundamental]` attributes is `Box<T>`. This basically means that if you implement a trait for `Box<T>` it won't show up in the \"Implemented Traits\" section of the documentation of type `T`.\n\nI think that the logic for detecting `#[fundamental]` on `Box<T>`, however, may be quite difficult. For example it needs to realize that the `Self` type for the `impl` is a path, it's then tagged `#[fundamental]`, it then has one type parameter, and that one type parameter is then the type we're interested in. I think for now we get some good wins by just picking up references (easy to detect), and we can certainly always expand more into other types later!\n\nI suspect that if we start growing the set of `#[fundamental]` types we'll need to implement this logic, but for now it doesn't seem super pressing (but I could be wrong!)\n",
