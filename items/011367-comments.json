    "body": "This was an explicit decision in the refactoring of `std::comm` recently. The main factor in doing this is to maintain readability and usability of most code. Having some notion of \"port and chan\" in the name just clutters up the symbols. This does breach normal convention, but it is also something that easily becomes normal and natural once you use it for awhile.\n\nThe names aren't set in stone forever, but I've heard generally positive feedback about the renamings. If we end up finding a better convention, then I think it's a good idea to rename, otherwise I think they're going to stay the way they are for now.\n\nClosing.\n",
