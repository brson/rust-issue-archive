    "body": "I would either add this to compiletest (`src/tools/compiletest`) or make it a tidy check (`src/tools/tidy`). If in compile\u00a0test, I would probably look for the code that loads in tests. I'm somewhat preferring using tidy for this, but would be fine with either. I'm also not entirely sure we even want this -- tests without assert_eq/assert seem fine to me, if for example they're testing for a lack of segfault or similar. We also don't have a compile-pass test suite so some run-pass tests are maybe just compile-pass tests (again, without assert_eq/assert). So I'm not sure that this is entirely the best issue to work on; if you're interested in this area I would look at one of these: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/40713 or https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33581. I can probably provide some details on thoughts on either issue, just leave a comment if interested.\r\n\r\nIf you want to implement this, feel free though. I think that we'll run into a lot of false positives, but I could be wrong. Let me know if there's anything we can help you with!",
