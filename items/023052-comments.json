    "body": "So while I understand mutexes and reference counting from other languages, I've never worked with a language that enforced safety at compile time. I understand why the compiler doesn't like the original program (where the data would be moved into three different threads), but I don't fully understand why doing\n\n```\nlet data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(vec![1u32, 2, 3]));\n```\n\nand then `data.clone()` followed by `data.lock()` silences the compiler errors (I get the gist of it, but how it actually happens feels somewhat \"magical\" to me). I think walking through the types that are returned and how they fix the ownership issues would be helpful here. Explaining why the mutex doesn't implement `Send` would also help to give an example of when you shouldn't implement `Send` on an object.\n\nAlso, does something need to implement `Send` to be captured by a `move ||` closure? I think the explanation of `Send` at the top should explicitly spell this out.\n",
