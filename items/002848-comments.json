    "body": "Technically, the compiler was behaving correctly: `beta` is a variable here, since you forgot the import. But I agree it's very confusing. In f39477d9260c5b346df5e5a71abaaca891a8195d I added a new hint to the error message that prints out all the pattern bindings when resolve fails with \"inconsistent number of bindings\". Try it out and let me know what you think!\n",
