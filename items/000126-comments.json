    "body": "This is because the task fails to unwind correctly if it's never executed. Here child2() never gets a chance to start before it is killed by main(). At this point the task's stack is in an inconsistent state which confuses the unwind glue. The frame pointer should be in the right place, and the frame_glue_fns should be initialized.\n\nThe unwind glue fails to drop the reference to the string, thus causing a leak.\n",
