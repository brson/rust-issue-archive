    "body": "The primary purpose of these strings is to not take up names like `/usr/lib/libstd.so` in a normal installation (that's a bit privileged). Cargo also does this so you can have two crates called \"foo\"  from either different sources or with different versions.\n\nI feel that `libstd-1.0.0.so` is still a bit more privileged than it needs to be and there's also some form of versioning on Linux anyway, so it may be odd to put versions elsewhere in the filename.\n",
