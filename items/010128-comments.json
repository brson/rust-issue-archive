    "body": "I played around with this for a bit using the `backtrace` function on OSX and linux. OSX refused to give any symbols at all (the `backtrace` function returned 0), and linux gave awful symbols names because all of our symbols in executables are flagged as `internal`. When getting a backtrace from a library, the symbol names were all acquired, but they were also all mangled.\n\nNot entirely sure how useful this would be in light of this, and it also turns out that `-Z extra-debug-info` doesn't improve symbols at all. Certainly worth the interesting project tag!\n",
