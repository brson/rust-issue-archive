The alternative is feature gating everything after macro expansion, and \"somehow marking\" the `std` macros as \"ok to expand to unstable code\". Or perhaps not expanding to unstable code in the std macros! Not sure if that's feasible or not without reviewing them (which I haven't done yet), but I imagine format_args will be the sitckler.\n",
