Furthermore, the adoption path that the feature gate provides isn't just for rustc, it's also for any third-party code that is impacted by this. And it's also more important with this change than with most, because this change is very deliberately removing functionality from Rust with no replacement (notably, because private supertraits are disallowed despite the expectation of nearly everyone who responded to the RFC, AFAIK there's no way to expose a trait that cannot be implemented by third-parties).\n\nIt's also important to note that this is a very controversial change to begin with. Not just because there was not a clear community consensus, but also because you have chosen to merge in the RFC despite the majority of the feedback being negative. You should be trying to avoid giving the community any more cause to be unhappy with this change.\n",

I think though that we do need to  amend the rules in two ways:\n1. Associated items in an impl count as public if the impl is implemented for a public type (when multidispatch comes around: if impl for only public types).\n2. `pub use` requires that its end point be public and reachable, but not that each individual step along the way be public.\n\nThe intution for point 1 is that, if these rules are doing their job, you the outsider cannot get your hands on an instance of a private type, nor can you name it, therefore you could not trigger the impl nor invoke its methods etc if any of the types are private.\n",

Alternatively we could change feature gate to opt IN to the new rules for time being until they are settled (and then only use it in tests).
