    "body": "There's a first pass at this in https://github.com/eholk/rust/tree/task-wakeup\n\nIt should be useable, but you might need to grab the scheduler lock to use it safely. Basically, derive a class from `rust_task::wakeup_callback` and then pass an instance of that class to `rust_task::on_wakeup`. Once the task gets woken up, your classe's `on_wakeup` method will be called.\n\nI'll work on making sure it's more robust, but it'd be good to see some actual use of this.\n",
