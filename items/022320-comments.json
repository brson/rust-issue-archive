    "body": "@petrochenkov yeah, seems like because of those reference impls this approach will require negative bounds at some point.\n\nHmm, I wonder how bad it would be remove those `impl` for `&T`/`&mut T`. IIRC, those are mainly to allow `&mut [] == &[]`, `&[] == &[]`, etc. But those would be already covered by the blanket `T: AsSlice` implementation. I guess you wouldn't be able to do `&5 == &5` though.\n\nYet another idea to reduce the impl bloat, is to make the `==` more magical and make it auto-deref/reborrow both sides until there's only one reference. As in given `a: &mut [_]`, `b: &Vec<_>`, then `a == b` would desugar to `PartialEq::eq(&*a, b)`. That way you would only have to focus on the base cases `[T]`, `str`, etc and not bother with the `&'a T` implementations, and while we are at it, we could (maybe) make it apply the \"unsize\" step to go from `[T; N]` to `[T]`. (cc @nikomatsakis is this idea feasible?)\n",

    "body": "@japaric \nI've made an experiment and replaced the problematic blanket impls for references with specific impls for `&[T]`/`&mut [T]`. It breaks a lot of code and sometimes there's no trivial way to fix it.\nAs an example look at the range comparisons in libcore/iter.rs (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcore/iter.rs#L2863). Those functions should be able to compare all kinds of iterators originating from `iter()`, `iter_mut()` or `into_iter()` but they can't be specialized to work differrently with reference iterators (\"dereference and compare\") and non-reference iterators (\"just compare\"), so our favorite reference impls do all the job for them and range comparison functions only do \"just compare\".\n",
