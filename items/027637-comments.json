    "body": "I thought about tackling this as a nice easy doc change and a foray into contributing, but when I saw the usages of `InvalidInput` and `InvalidData` there really isn't definitive differentiation to go on.\n\nI did a code-search on GitHub for usages of the two:\n- [Here's the usages of `InvalidInput`](https://github.com/search?q=InvalidInput+language%3Arust&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).\n- [Here's the usages of `InvalidData`](https://github.com/search?q=InvalidData+language%3Arust&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).\n\nThey both appear to be used almost identically, in that people are using both to represent corrupted or malformed parameter data. My gut feeling says `InvalidData` was meant to be the error type for this job (parameter _values_), and that `InvalidInput` was meant for returning errors related to parameter _types_ across program boundaries (eg. arguments to external programs, shell calls, etc). Not sure who would know, but would be good to get some confirmation of what these were supposed to mean.\n",
