    "body": "Sorry I should have made this clearer: this change affects running _documentation_ tests under rustdoc, e.g. \n\n``````\n// foo.rs\n#![crate_id=\"foo\"]\n\n//! This is a small crate\n\n/**\n```rust\nassert!(true);\n```\n\n```ignore\nassert!(!false);\n```\n*/\n/// foo always returns 5\npub fn foo() -> int {\n    5\n}\n``````\n\n```\n$ rustdoc --test foo.rs \n\nrunning 1 test\ntest foo_0 ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured\n```\n\nThis is the result I get after building from master, when it should really output `test result: 1 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored; 0 measured` for the last line.\n\n> I'm a little confused about the changes to libtest, could you provide a before/after of what you changed? \n\nLooking over the diff again I just realized my misunderstanding of some code in libtest. I (wrongly) believed that libtest was also dropping tests marked as `ignored`, and tried to \"improve\" the code. The main problem for this issue is just rustdoc ignoring the tests. I'll remove my changes to libtest and update the PR branch.\n",
