These are all in comments and not code, but it still failed? \n\nAlso, you said to make the following to an i32:\n-    /// let a = [1i, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n-    /// let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nI thought that if an integer doesn't have a suffix, it's typed as an i32 as a default? If so, why should this need an i32 suffix?\n",
