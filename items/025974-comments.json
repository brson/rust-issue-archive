There's not reason for the architectures here to make a call to an external function other than that it's just tougher to translate them into inline assembly.\n\n> Should I just inline them?\n\nUnless there's a big benefit to doing so, I'd avoid it for now. This code is probably on its way out anyway if we can move to stack probes and otherwise it's just somewhat of a maintenance burden.\n\n> Does something (llvm?) provide these as intrinsics?\n\nUnfortunately, no :(\n",
