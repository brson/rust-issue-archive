If we did the rewrite you suggested, at\nleast according to the current rules, it would mean that the\ndestrutors always execute at the end of the current block, more or\nless, which is usually not what people want. The current rules are\nmostly that temporary destructors end at the end of the current\nstatement, unless the temporary is being assigned into a `let`-bound\nvariable, in which case they live as long as the variable.

    "body": "I just want to leave my 2c that this is a very frustrating issue for newbies. I didn't think of myself as a newbie, having written two fairly stable libraries in rust, but today I was trying to write a memory manager for micro-controllers, learning about `unsafe` and `PhantomData` and all sorts of fun stuff -- all of which went great. Then, when I was ready to test my library I hit this compiler error which I had never seen before.\n\nThinking it was something I did with the internals, I began to question my entire way of doing things. Long story short it took me the better part of 4 hours to finally realize that nothing was wrong with my library. No -- what was wrong is that I hadn't put a `let` statement on every `unwrap`. I really feel like rust has left me down -- the behavior as-is is super unintuative.\n\nI wish I had listened to the compiler better... maybe that is the lesson I really should learn here.\n",

This will hopefully get done soon, [you can see a draft here](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rfcs/blob/rfc66-amendment/text/0066-better-temporary-lifetimes.md).\r\n\r\nMy basic plan (at a very high level) is to:\r\n\r\n- step 1: convert the construction of the \"extended temporary\" tables into on-demand \r\n    - I hope that typeck doesn't need these results; I think they are only needed by borrowck, but I have to verify\r\n- step 2: have that construction also demand the signatures of functions that are called and the typeck tables, so that we can find out what methods are being called\r\n    - if that doesn't work, a bit more refactoring will be needed\r\n    - if it *does* work, we should be able to use that to compute the temporary tables easily enough...",

    "body": "I'm wondering about how this feature will interact with [non-lexical lifetimes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2094). Consider the following:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let x;\r\n    {\r\n        x = &String::from(\"foo\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, this results in an error: `temporary value dropped here while still borrowed`. Under RFC 66, the lifetime of the temporary value (the result of `String::from(\"foo\")`) would be extended to encompass the lifetime of its referents. The original RFC is pretty unspecific about the exact behavior of this extension.\r\n\r\nMy question: with NLLs, the lifetime of the reference in `x` is shortened:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let x;\r\n    {\r\n        x = &String::from(\"foo\");\r\n        // `x` is dead here\r\n        // Is the `String` dropped here?\r\n    }\r\n    // Or is it dropped here?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould the lifetime of the temporary created by `String::from` be extended to match the lexical (scope-based) lifetime of `x`, or would the compiler see that the reference stored in `x` is dead and drop the `String` immediately?",

I would love if this RFC got more attention. I bet this issue would be generating a lot of buzz if people knew\r\n\r\n* It's probably 100% possible to implement today\r\n* There is an existing backwards-compatible RFC for this feature\r\n\r\nI understand why this isn't a high-priority issue.

That would prevent us from making improvements like NLL without changing the runtime semantics of code, which is not good. This RFC is actually much more limited \u2014 it runs before any inference etc has been done. \r\n\r\nI've not carved out any time for my expanded version of the RFC -- I should at least push it somewhere I guess -- but I still think this is a good idea =)",
