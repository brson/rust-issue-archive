I think today that `enum { A(i8), B(i8) }` is the size of two words because the discriminant is `uint` and the payload is `i32`, but in theory the enum can be a 16-bit struct of two i8's.

    "body": "And it's even worse than that.  I'm glad @alexcrichton suggested some tests of enums with fields, because we have a problem there: `Either<u8, i16>` is 4 bytes long and therefore immediate, and its type_of is `{i8, i16, [0 x i8]}` (taking the highest-alignment case and padding it, like Clang does for unions), which means that the body of the `Left` case is lost and replaced with stack garbage because the second byte the LLVM type is alignment padding.\n\nIn contrast, before the immediate type stuff landed, it didn't matter that fields of one case might overlap alignment padding of another, because we'd always do pointer casts and access the memory at the correct type.  And without the enum discriminant size changes, an enum with any non-unit-like fields is necessarily larger than an `int` and so not immediate.\n\nI _think_ I know how to fix this.\n",

    "body": "This _almost_ works.  I'm seeing breakage in the rustpkg tests due to stack exhaustion while generating drop glue, which goes away if I raise `RUST_MIN_STACK` to 4194304 (rather than the default of 4000000).  This suggests that rustpkg is invoking rustc without going through `rustc::monitor`, which seems like a bug.  I'm not sure what the right fix there is.  I also don't know why my changes would increase stack size.\n\nBut the rest of `make check` passes for me (Linux, x86_64 and i686).\n",
