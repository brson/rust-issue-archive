I was unaware of a performance cost from splitting into sections. Is there data to support this (benchmarks I can run to analyze what happens)?\n",

I may have measured the size increase incorrectly last time, it's definitely much less drastic now than it was before. The link time for hello world does increase, on linux it jumps from 25ms to 75ms (I forgot to measure this earlier). It's still under 100ms, however, which is the main goal that I was shooting for before.\n",
