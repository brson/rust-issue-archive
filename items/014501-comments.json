    "body": "This PR is for an RFC that has not been accepted (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/77), and it was agreed upon based upon the data that you collected, so I just wanted to ensure that the data is accurate. If there are inconsistencies, then we're accepting that RFC under false pretenses, which seems like something we should definitely deal with now, not later. I'm not saying we should debate about capture clauses.\n\nIt looks like your data only deals with the class of upvars being capture, but it sounded like you were surprised by a few use cases when implementing this. Some upvars were copyable, but they needed to be captured by reference (due to how they were used in the closure). Does your analysis take into account these use cases, or are they accidentally outside the originally counted 10% of closures that needed to change?\n\nOne of my worries is that this new by-val capture is double-bad where you need by-ref captures. Not only do you have to create another local for the capture, but you also have to indent the entire closure by creating a new scope to kill the borrow. This is a fixable issue, but it will seriously reduce the prevalence of closures in libraries to do what would possibly otherwise be simple tasks.\n\nI also agree with @pnkfelix that this is difficult to review because it's all jumbled together (and github is super slow at huge diffs). Could you at least separate the rustc analysis changes, and then per-library migrations? It may also be ok to have rustc analysis changes and rustc-library migrations in the same commit (just splicing this commit up by folder in that case).\n",

This upvar has a copyable type, and it looks like your data classifies it as a copyable upvar. Your statistics would then include this as a closure which doesn't need to be modified. How does this closure get classified in your data?\n\nI'm still not opposed to this change, I wanted to verify that your data was accurate because this was much larger than I was expecting. If there really are 5172 unmodified closures, then this seems like it's still beneficial. I was just expressing that on the surface it appears that the data you collected may be inaccurate, and was curious if you discovered anything during this migration which would cause you to revise your results.\n",
