    "body": "This is actually working as intended due to the way we parse statements and expressions. In a statement context we'll parse the match statement early on and then look for an expression afterwards, so the problematic case above fails to parse. In all other situations we know we're parsing an expression so we can look for `&&` afterwards. As this is working as intended, though, I'm going to close.\n",
