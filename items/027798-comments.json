    "body": "The long-term vision of concurrency support within `std` is a bit unclear. The deprecation here reflects a general desire to stick to binding system primitives (as we do with locks). For now, user-space synchronization can live out of tree. (Under this rubric, channels don't really belong either, and in hindsight that would probably have been a reasonable call.)\n\nAll that said, in the long run I believe that it's important for Rust to have some official user-space concurrency constructs. This could be a rust-lang crate, or eventually land in std.\n",
