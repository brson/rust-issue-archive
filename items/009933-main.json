  "body": "As discovered in #9925, it turns out that we weren't using jemalloc on most\nplatforms. Additionally, on some platforms we were using it incorrectly and\nmismatching the libc version of malloc with the jemalloc version of malloc.\n\nAdditionally, it's not clear that using jemalloc is indeed a large performance\nwin in particular situtations. This could be due to building jemalloc\nincorrectly, or possibly due to using jemalloc incorrectly, but it is unclear at\nthis time.\n\nUntil jemalloc can be confirmed to integrate correctly on all platforms and has\nverifiable large performance wins on platforms as well, it shouldn't be part of\nthe default build process. It should still be available for use via the\nLD_PRELOAD trick on various architectures, but using it as the default allocator\nfor everything would require guaranteeing that it works in all situtations,\nwhich it currently doesn't.\n\nCloses #9925\n",
