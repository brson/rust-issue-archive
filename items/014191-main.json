  "body": "We were correctly determining the attributes needed for the parameters for extern fns, but when that extern fn was from another crate we never bothered to pass that information along to LLVM. (i.e never called `foreign::add_argument_attributes`).\n\nI've just changed both local and non-local (crate) extern fn's to be dealt with together (through `foreign::register_foreign_item_fn`) so we don't run into something like again.\n\nFixes #14177.\n",
