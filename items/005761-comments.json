    "body": "@thestinger \n\nThat sounds reasonable. There is the question of how the SIGTERM equivalent should work on Windows, though - it looks like a can of worms to implement such a thing, and it only works for GUI apps (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2055753/how-to-gracefully-terminate-a-process).\n\nI suppose the Windows equivalent of the SIGTERM sender could either do nothing or alternatively just call TerminateProcess like the the SIGKILL equivalent does. It might be safer if it did nothing because on Unix SIGTERM may well be ignored by the target process.\n",
