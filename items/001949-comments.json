Just replace lenny with wheezy, which is the current debian testing version and next stable one. It will require about 3GB hard disk.\n\nI like it as a fast way to test somewhat experimental software a bit isolated from my main system, even though the combination of debootstrap and chroot is not an ultimate security feature (see for example: http://blog.technologyofcontent.com/2011/04/sandboxing-for-multi-tenant-applications/)\n",
