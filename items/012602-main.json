  "body": "Whenever a failure happens, if a program is run with\n`RUST_LOG=std::rt::backtrace` a backtrace will be printed to the task's stderr\nhandle. Stack traces are uncondtionally printed on double-failure and\nrtabort!().\n\nThis ended up having a nontrivial implementation, and here's some highlights of\nit:\n- We're bundling libbacktrace for everything but OSX and Windows\n- We use libgcc_s and its libunwind apis to get a backtrace of instruction\n  pointers\n- On OSX we use dladdr() to go from an instruction pointer to a symbol\n- On unix that isn't OSX, we use libbacktrace to get symbols\n- Windows, as usual, has an entirely separate implementation\n\nLots more fun details and comments can be found in the source itself.\n\nCloses #10128\n",
