I would imagine that these cases are not being inlined by LLVM because it's _impossible_ to inline a non-generic, non-`#[inline]` function, not because they shouldn't be.\n\nWith LTO, however, LLVM optimizes _all code_ so _everything_ is candidate for inlining, which is why I would suspect that these functions may not need to be `#[inline]`.\n",
