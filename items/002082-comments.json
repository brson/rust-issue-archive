    "body": "We're likely to take the word `extern` to stand in for `native` in the current module-declaration scheme. But I agree that these two matters ought to be unified. Here's my suggestion:\n- Differentiate declarations and definitions. For both consts and fns. See #1071\n- An `extern` module is one that is full of declarations only.\n- A declaration is only legal when qualified with `extern` explicitly, or implicitly within an `extern` module.\n- A definition _might_ be `extern` as well. If so, it's equivalent to today's `crust` fn types. That is: by placing `extern` on a definition you're saying you want to make _that definition_ visible-and-usable to external language/linkage rules.\n- We define a default interpretation of the ABI-and-language-rules-you-mean when you say `extern`, and permit overriding that by attributes rather than fixed strings. The default is C and cdecl or something.\n",

In general we haven't any support for item-qualifier blocks yet (eg. `extern` blocks, `pub` / `priv` blocks, `unsafe` blocks for globals as in #553) but I'm not opposed to that approach. It'll take a bit of legwork, is all.\n\nLibrary names on arbitrary modules will probably come to pass as part of #2176, though I am not sure. Lots of interdependencies in this cluster of bugs, sadly.\n",

We express most stuff through `extern`.\n\nThe first step in making this is just to make `extern` work for `crust` and `native` presently.\n",
