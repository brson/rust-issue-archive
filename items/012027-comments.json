An example of this is #8449.\n\nBy bundling compiler-rt, we can both have a better understanding of what our dependencies are, plus we are going to be able to correctly lower all valid LLVM IR to something that we can compile.\n",

    "body": "This is an amazing effort, thank you for doing this! Some thoughts:\n- I would expect all rust programs to depend on `compiler-rt`, similarly to how all rust programs depend on `libmorestack`. You should be able to compile various parts of rust without the standard library.\n- I think we'll want to abuse the `llvm-auto-clean-trigger` for also triggering a rebuild of compiler-rt (I can help with the makefiles)\n- I'm a little worried about the number of patches which you have on top of `compiler-rt` master, but we haven't made a fantastic effort yet to upstream our patches, so this is probably fine for now. We'll also want to put the fork at `rust-lang/compiler-rt` (like llvm/libuv/gyp/etc).\n- To prevent the inclusion of libgcc, we may want to start using `-nodefaultlibs` on platforms.\n",
