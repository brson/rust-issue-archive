If people like this idea, I can write an appengine app to do this or something else.\n\nBy way of example and test, I have a package available at github:elly/rust-hello, http://www.leptoquark.net/~elly/rust-hello.tar, and uuid:83941200-18b3-41b1-8316-b98a2950b33a.\n\nAnyone have thoughts on this? :)\n",

I think it is a promising start.\n\nrustc and cargo need to agree on where rust software lives so that cargo-install libraries are automatically resolved by rustc. rustc can already give you the global sysroot with 'rustc --sysroot', but we should probably also have something like --hostlibs, because rust libraries currently live under /usr/lib/rustc/${arch}/lib. And then we also probably need rustc and cargo to share the same idea of where user-specific stuff lives.\n\nI like just building packages straight from their git repo.\n",
