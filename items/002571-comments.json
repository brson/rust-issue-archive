Even if I could get it to compile, it doesn't determine nor address the underlying reason for this bug.\n\nIt could be useful to see if this is a problem on 32-bit hardware in general, if anyone has any lying around.

    "body": "I investigated on this box and noticed that it has very little RAM (512MB maybe). I reproduced the error once and also rustc got killed by the OOM killer once.\n\nMy current theory is that the addrspace change forced LLVM to use more RAM, so when we go to spawn the linker process it ends up failing, but I haven't actually debugged the call to rust_run_process to see what happens.\n\nThe real problem here may be that we don't report better errors when fork fails.\n",
