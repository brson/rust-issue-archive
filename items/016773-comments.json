I think a lot of the usability and casting problems you are seeing is because a `*mut T` should really be silently coercable to `*const T` (as in C). The fact that it is not seems like a bug. I plan on opening an RFC about this, don't anticipate any reason for it not to sail through.\n\nIn this particular case, for example, returning a `*mut T` should be strictly more convenient, from a casting point of view, as a `*const T`.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis I think what @carllerche is trying to say is that in C, `const*` is a strictness opt-in, while regular pointers are assumed to be sloppy. The Rust approach **appears** to be strict in both cases, when, in fact, `mut*` is just trying to communicate sloppiness.\n\nI think both @carllerche and I would prefer `const*` to communicate strictness and plain old `*T` to communicate sloppiness. There may still be some use-case for `mut*` in that scheme (if the FFI bindings know that it actually **is** safe to mutate), and that would actually be a useful thing to communicate.\n",

    "body": "> It makes sense for Rust to respect the actual C type signatures, especially since that's what automatic binding generation would do - and we should not be doing it by hand anyway (too error prone and not at all portable).\n\nI can't imagine a way that defining the return value of `strerror` as `const*` would produce a portability hazard. Are you thinking that there could be cases where a program was **required** to mutate the memory returned by `strerror`, but only in platforms where the backing memory was not static? This seems extremely farfetched to me.\n\nThe benefit of declaring memory that we know to be static as const is the same as the stated reason for this feature: to help programs avoid mistakes in Rust that would be easy to make in C through use of the Rust type system.\n\nThe proposal by @carllerche and me is to start off with \"sloppy\" (type-system mutable) pointers, and only mark them as `const*` if we **know** that the backing memory can be constant. In some cases, that will be because the C type signature uses `const*`. In this case, it's because the spec explicitly says that the memory must not be changed.\n\nSpecifying the return value as `mut*` actually produces a worse portability problem: someone may come to depend on the mutability of the memory on a platform that allows it, and then fail on other platforms. Marking memory that can be static on some platforms as `const*` seems like the exact opposite of a portability hazard.\n",
