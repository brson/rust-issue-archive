    "body": "[The RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1040-duration-reform.md) for `Duration` explicitly avoided this method:\n\n> This proposal does not include a method to get a number of milliseconds from a Duration, because the number of milliseconds could exceed u64, and we would have to decide whether to return an Option, panic, or wait for a standard bignum. In the interest of limiting this proposal to APIs with a straight-forward design, this proposal defers such a method.\n\nAs a result, I think that accessor methods like this may wish to go through an RFC. For example I would have questions along the lines of:\n- What about other units of time? Should we have `as_foo` for minutes, hours, microseconds, nanoseconds, etc?\n- Should there also be `subsec_foo` for microseconds and milliseconds?\n",
