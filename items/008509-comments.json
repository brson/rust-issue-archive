    "body": "Hmm, well, the ABI strings aren't quite able to handle this example because they only distinguish by architecture, not by O/S. But perhaps we should fix this. In that case, one could put `extern \"stdcall cdecl\"` and it would select stdcall on Windows. but I imagine the reason I didn't do this is that sometimes on linux code still uses the pascal calling convention. This could be accommodated by having another name for pascal calling convention on linux; I'm not sure what the standard names in use are though. Otherwise, I tend to agree with @brson; a macro might help here. (It's quite possible the current ABI sets should just go away in favor of such macros as well)\n",
