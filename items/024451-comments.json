I'm not so certain about the `WARN: {}` syntax here, but we don't have any prior work here outside of compiler diagnostics.\n\nI would personally feel it's a little too late to make a change like this, but I agree that if we do this it should make its way into the beta channel. If this does go in it would also be nice for the `--help` of test binaries to not show `--nocapture` at all by default.\n",
