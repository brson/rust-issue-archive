    "body": "Some detail: Moz is developing https://wiki.mozilla.org/L20n to handle Firefox's localization needs, and hoping to standardize this API in JS. Localization is hard, and serious software tends not to use the localization support from any language platform. It's best if we make _no effort_ to solve this problem _badly_ and leave it to a completely library-based solution that can be evolved in the community and officially endorsed once it's fully-baked.\n\nWhat we _do_ need to investigate still is _internationalization_ and locales. Internationalization is the mechanical conversion of locale-specific types like dates according to standard rules, whereas localization is the human translation of locale-specific data such as strings.\n\ni18n is the subject of https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/14494\n",
