    "body": "Hmm, looks like I missed this case when I fixed a very similar issue (moving in multiple guard expressions). The issue is that the way the final guard is handled means that it acts as if it can't fail. Wiring up the contents of `prev_guards` to arm exit in the case where the arm has no guard and no bindings (including wildcard) should fix it. It should also do the same at the very end, adding edges from the remaining guards to the exit of the match expression.\n\n@Manishearth I tried disallowing it, but there's some code around that moves in guards. Its also a breaking change.\n",

Borrows due to by-ref bindings in matches are scoped the match expression itself, meaning that something like:\n\n``` rust\nmatch foo_opt {\n  Some(ref foo) if cond => { ... }\n  None => { foo_opt.val = bar; }\n}\n```\n\nwill complain that you can't assign to `foo_opt.val` because it's already borrowed (which is clearly not true).

    "body": "The current status of MIR-borrowck indicates that we can address the [first example][] and the [second example][]. We also correctly reject the `cfg(segfault)` case in the [third example][]; but it unfortunately *also rejects* the `cfg(not(segfault))` case in that same [third example][].\r\n\r\nMy inclination is to land regression tests, alongside `feature(nll)`, for the three cases that segfault under AST borrowck. We obviously can also deploy `feature(nll)` as long as it is opt-in while the `cfg(not(segfault))` case continues to be rejected. At that time, we should file a new ticket to investigate extending MIR-borrowck to accept the `cfg(not_segfault))` scenario outlined in the [third example][].\r\n\r\n[first example]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29723#issue-115922164\r\n[second example]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29723#issuecomment-155130061\r\n[third example]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29723#issuecomment-340737840",
