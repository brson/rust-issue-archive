    "body": "I'm hesitant to add this to the standard library \"just so we can have it\", and I remember something similar to this was proposed recently, but I'm unable to find it now.\n\nThe question that I would have is to what degree are we providing hashing algorithms? Why not provide things like sha1 and friends? Most of those probably don't belong in the standard library itself, but rather as part of the standard distribution.\n\nI would be more comfortable extracting this to `libhash`, but even that is not necessarily the best solution.\n",

    "body": "I'd be very happy with an extraction to `libhash`, but I viewed that as an orthogonal change. The proposal you were mentioning came from #11783 by @erickt. Based on the discussion there, I assumed that this would either go in `std::hash` or `libhash`, but, given that `libhash` does not even exist yet, the discussion of which is correct and how many algorithms we provide would go in the PR creating `libhash`.\n\nIf you would rather me roll that into this PR, then I'm willing to do so, but I saw that as seperate and possibly worthy of a RFC.\n",
