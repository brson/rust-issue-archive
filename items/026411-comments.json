    "body": "So the backtrace-debuginfo test fails with optimizations enabled because LLVM can tail-merge the blocks that call `dump_filelines` now, which means that we get the same line info for both of these call paths:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotdash/rust/blob/e4872167f5dda8eebc3b68a2050f870fa4457b50/src/test/run-pass/backtrace-debuginfo.rs#L92\nhttps://github.com/dotdash/rust/blob/e4872167f5dda8eebc3b68a2050f870fa4457b50/src/test/run-pass/backtrace-debuginfo.rs#L103\n\nDoes anybody have an idea how to \"work around\" that optimization? If not, I'd like to just remove the second call, as that seems to be testing LLVM rather than rust.\n",
