    "body": "I had a cursory look into 0install today. Here's what I've found.\n\nEvery 0install package is defined by an XML metadata file, called a [\"feed\"](http://0install.net/interface-spec.html). The feed contains the package name, description, version, dependencies &c -- the kind of metadata we already provide in `lib.rs`.\n\nDependencies are specified similarly to rustpkg -- using URLs -- but instead of linking to the git repository, we link to the appropriate XML feed instead. The 0install resolver recursively downloads these feeds, building a graph of dependencies, before running a SAT solver on the whole lot.\n\nPackages are installed in a global cache, keyed by a checksum of the package contents. This checksum is included in the feed. We should eventually remove the hash suffixes from our library names, since 0install makes this system redundant.\n\nA good first step would be to write feeds for `rustc`, `rustdoc` et al., and publish them on the main site. The [packaging tutorial](http://0install.net/packagers.html) has plenty of info on this.\n\nNext, we should figure out how to build Rust packages with 0install -- maybe write a cheat sheet mapping rustpkg annotations to 0install elements.\n\nThe only issue I have is usability. 0install's XML format is much harder to write than our current annotations, and has too many degrees of freedom. We can solve this by writing a wrapper (let's call it `rage`) that generates feeds automatically, but that sounds a bit hacky. Any ideas?\n\nI'll try to experiment further with 0install over the next few days. Stay tuned :musical_note:\n",

    "body": "> we could write a converter to convert the current annotations to this XML format (possibly server-side)\n\nI did consider this idea, but it's very brittle. You'll need to run this hypothetical converter every time you modify your own projects, taking care to keep it in sync with your crate file.\n\nOn the server side: 0install doesn't support downloading git repositories directly, only tarballs. So we have to serve archives from the server as well.\n\nThere's also a leaky abstraction here. Despite our best attempts at hiding the 0install syntax, the user will need to learn about the format eventually, when they run into the limits of our annotation system. Then they'll have two syntaxes to worry about.\n\n> fork 0install and implement json.\n\nThat's possible, and a bit more elegant, but difficult. The [existing code](https://github.com/0install/0install/blob/master/ocaml/zeroinstall/feed.mli) seems to be tightly coupled to the XML representation, so it'll take a bit of hacking to work.\n",
