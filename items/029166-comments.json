    "body": "(It looks like `vec::Drain` may need similar treatment too, but I am having trouble actually making a concrete test illustrating the necessity there -- it seems when I call `.drain` instead of `.into_iter` in the above test case, even stable and beta complain about lifetime issues.  Maybe the old dropck is catching something I'm missing in my manual analysis of `vec::Drain`, so I'm not going to lump that in until I see evidence that it is warranted.)\n\nUpdate: Oh, duh, `Drain` has a lifetime bound (and a `Drop` impl), so of course the old dropck was going to reject it.\n",
