    "body": "UPDATE: This comment appears to have been a bit confused! See [revised instructions below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18510#issuecomment-331167807).\r\n\r\nNo work has been done on this to my knowledge, but I am in favor of the solution you proposed @coder543, and would be happy to work with you on implementing it. If nothing else, it would help us gain experience with overhead etc. \r\n\r\nI think that the strategy we would use is to modify the code that generates MIR (our mid-level intermediate IR) for calls, which is found [in this file here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5803f99bd4c53c3f469df26513ffa2e058094c53/src/librustc_mir/build/expr/into.rs#L204-L253). You can see that it generates the [code to execute upon unwind right here, on this line](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5803f99bd4c53c3f469df26513ffa2e058094c53/src/librustc_mir/build/expr/into.rs#L240) -- currently, this is always cleanup code. We could modify it to inspect the type of the value being invoked (and, in particular, its ABI) and generate alternate unwind code that aborts (I'm not sure the best way to encode an abort right now though).\r\n\r\nThe function being called is stored in [the `fun` variable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5803f99bd4c53c3f469df26513ffa2e058094c53/src/librustc_mir/build/expr/into.rs#L240), which is an `Operand<'tcx>`. Operands support a `ty` method (defined [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5803f99bd4c53c3f469df26513ffa2e058094c53/src/librustc/mir/tcx.rs#L212-L219)). In principle, I suppose, we could call it like `fun.ty(&this.local_decls, this.hir.tcx())` -- that method is only meant to be called after MIR construction is complete, but I think it will actually work just fine. (Otherwise, we could extract the type of the function being called from the HAIR, which is the intermediate representation we are building things from; but that's just a touch more involved.)\r\n\r\nThe main question then is how to generate MIR that aborts. Right now I think we have no way to encode an abort into the IR. We could probably add an ABORT terminator (i.e., a new variant of the MIR data structure `TerminatorKind`, found in `src/librustc/mir/mod.rs`). \r\n\r\nSo, if you were going to implement this, I think we would do the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Add an ABORT terminator to `TerminatorKind` and work through the various implications. That could be a PR by itself, although it'd be presently unused.\r\n2. Inspect the types of callees as described above, find those with `C` ABIs, and generate an ABORT terminator instead.\r\n\r\nThat might be two PRs, or maybe one. To get started, one might also skip the first step, and just experiment with having the compiler print out a match when it finds a C ABI function, and then worry about how to handle it.",

    "body": "@coder543 hey, sorry I dropped the ball on those notifications! Missed them somehow. Still digging out of a months-long hole. \r\n\r\nAlso, re-reading my mentoring instructions, I think **I** was confused! That is, I also believe that the goal is to catch unwinds in an `extern \"C\" fn foo() { .. }` function, but the instructions I wrote seem to be talking about intercepting calls to `extern \"C\"` functions, which is sort of irrelevant. Sorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\nThat said, it's still true that we need an abort terminator, but the job is substantially easier I think. We just need to find when we are generating MIR for `extern \"C\"` functions and modify what we do in the final *unwind* block -- currently we generate (I think) a `TerminatorKind::Resume`, but we would instead generate `TerminatorKind::Abort`. (Alternatively, we could just change how to *interpret* `Resume` -- i.e., its meaning might depend on the ABI of the enclosing function, with anything non-Rust meaning \"ABORT\", but somehow that feels a bit hacky to me.)\r\n\r\n@arielb1 does that sounds reasonable to you?",

As of now I have only manually inspected mir and llvm-ir to see that it looks correct.\r\n\r\nYes! Tests should definitely be added. One way to do this is to write a `run-pass` test that invokes itself using `Command`, passing some arguments and then checking the return code.  [`sigpipe-should-be-ignored.rs` is an example of a test that uses that technique.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d9ecdfe3a7a579b9ec89355168f13760c670d4d4/src/test/run-pass/sigpipe-should-be-ignored.rs)\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure why my is_foreign_item row is not working, I think that would be better if we could use it\r\n\r\nCan you say a bit more, I'm not sure what that means?\r\n\r\n> For all places where the compiler complained about a missing `TerminatorKind::Abort` branch\r\n\r\nOK, I'll double-check when you open a PR.\r\n\r\n> Not sure what to do on the mir inlining pass. But it does not seem to happen in my small tests, maybe this is something experimental which is not enabled by default?\r\n\r\nIt is experimental and does not happen by default. You can enable it with `-Zmir-opt-level=2`. It would be great if you did test it -- I think you should be able to \"link up\" the abort block from the inlined function into the abort block in the caller, presumably handling it in a similar fashion to how resume is handled or something...I'll have to go look in more depth.\r\n\r\nIn general, it'd be great if you wanted to open a PR and we can discuss in more depth there! Feel free to tag it with `[WIP]` in the subject line, and be sure to put `r? @nikomatsakis` so that it gets assigned to me.\r\n\r\n",
