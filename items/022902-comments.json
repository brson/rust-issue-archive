    "body": "Sorry to complicate a straightforward issue, but the Primitive str docs list trait implementations (and relevant examples/explanations) that aren't listed in the std::str docs.  I include the link to `StrExt` and have a quick explanation of why it exists. My question is should I find a way to list those traits and examples in the std::str module as well, or include a link to the primitive (or both.)\n\nPros to providing links to both the primitive as well as `StrExt` instead of including primitive information in the module doc is that it allows very clear and intuitive rhetoric where you can directly reference the primitive and `StrExt` as two sides of the same coin.  The downside is that we then have 3 places where information about `str` exists.\n\nIf we find a way to include the trait implementations in the module docs then it consolidates things in one place, empowering Ctrl+F.  However it doesn't really reflect the organization of the code itself.  Plus, I'm not sure rustdoc has the ability to do that, which would kind of decide it anyway.\n\nYay reading way too much into the line \"copy the text from http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html into it.\"\n",
