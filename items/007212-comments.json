    "body": "Unique boxes are equivalent to a paired malloc/free in C, they don't use garbage collection and would have to copy.\n\nA persistent data structure has to be implemented with @ (garbage collection) or Rc (reference counting). There's no global garbage collector so they won't be sendable between tasks, and `Rc` isn't sendable because it doesn't use atomic reference counting.\n\nI have #4987 open about reimplementing the persistent tree to make it actually useful, and new bugs can be opened for other specific data structures. I don't think it really makes sense to have a metabug for this.\n\nRealistically, concurrent access to persistent data structures would require implementing a global garbage collector for immutable data. There's `extra::arc` for sendable atomic reference counted types, but reference counting is only acceptable for persistent data structures with a low fanout, like 1 for a list, or 2 for a binary tree. For acceptable performance, most persistent data structures would require implementing a global garbage collector for immutable data.\n",
