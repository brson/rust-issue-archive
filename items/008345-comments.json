    "body": "From a \"runtimeless rust\" perspective, this is a bit of a nuanced issue. I believe that there are a few viable modes of operation which may be desired for \"split stacks\":\n1. You use the default split stacks. This means LLVM is configured to emit calls to `__morestack` and you're linking to `librustrt` and `libmorestack` to provide the corresponding implementations. As the default mode, this will prevent running over the maximum stack limit, and you will automatically switch stacks once you hit the stack limit (as determined by the runtime).\n2. You do not want the _default_ `__morestack` implementation, you are saying that you will provide your own. This implies that `librustrt` and `libmorestack` are _not_ linked to by default. This means that LLVM will still emit instrumentation at the prologue of each function, but you will get a linker error if you don't link to a library with a function called `__morestack`. \n3. You don't even want instrumentation. This means that LLVM will cease emission of prologues, and rustrt/morestack aren't linked to by default.\n\nI think that the vast majority of people will fall into option 1 (they're just using rust normally), and then a large portion of the remaining people will fall into bucket 3. In bucket 3 there are no assumptions made about the stack, and it's up to your own runtime to guarantee that you have enough. This could involve allocating guard pages, but regardless the compiler doesn't need to know about it.\n\n@thestinger brings up a good point though in that option 2 should not be left out. There are many situations where stack overflow is a serious problem, and having checks against that is very beneficial. The downside of this option is the stack limit _must_ be stored in _one_ particular location (where LLVM expects it). I think that the most difficult part here will be clearly documenting what option 2 implies for each architecture. From a user's perspective they'll have to ensure that the stack limit is in the right place before calling any rust code (or use a #[no_split_stack] attribute).\n\nFrom that, as an actionable item, I would propose the following following states based on crate attributes:\n- no attributes - the is the default behavior as it is today. You link against `libstd` by default, you've got segmented stacks, and the support for those comes from `librustrt` and `libmorestack`\n- `no_std` - this is as it is today, it simply disables linking against `libstd` by default (note that `librustrt` and `libmorestack` are still linked by default). You'd be able to still access the C++ runtime, but it wouldn't be there by default (it's just supporting split stacks through malloc, I'm not sure if this works right now)\n- `no_default_morestack` - disables linking to `librustrt` and `libmorestack` by default. This encompasses case 2 above, and it implies the `no_std` attribute (because `libstd` depends on `librustrt`)\n- `no_split_stack` - disables segmented stacks entirely for the crate as a whole (case 3). Furthermore, this implies `no_default_morestack` which in turn implies `no_std`.\n\nWhat do others think about this? These attributes have diverged a bit from discussing optional split stacks to more of a runtimeless-rust, but most of this is still about split stacks so I decided to leave it here rather than on the metabug.\n",

It probably makes more sense to omit it on a function-by-function basis, and require that those functions be `unsafe` so that the caller is responsible for making sure there's enough stack space for them.\n\nThe solution to the 1-5% performance hit from the checks is to use guard pages and only insert the check when functions allocate more than the guard page size - it shouldn't be too hard to teach LLVM to omit them in those cases.\n",

    "body": "Omitting `no_split_stack` doesn't quite sit well with me. It's certainly unreasonable to mark every function in a crate as `unsafe` (plus that defeats the whole point of `unsafe` analysis). I'm not worried here about the performance hit at all, I think that's an entirely separate discussion from this.\n\nIf rust is a language which wants to target _everything_, then I think it should be configurable in almost every way. I can think that perhaps various microcontrollers or kernels don't need to bother with stack protection and it just provides an extra burden to define.\n\nThat being said, it would be very easy to emulate `no_split_stack` by using `no_default_morestack` and then writing a no-op `__morestack` function. I think that that's a bit of a hacky solution which is encompassed better in `no_split_stack`.\n\nThinking about it though, I can't think of too many strategies that would actually be taken, so there would probably be just a few libraries (maybe officially maintained?) which provide this functionality.\n- First we've got the default librustrt\n- Then there could be the windows-like library which allocates guard pages and tells LLVM to skip checks on functions with < 1 page of stack space.\n- Finally there could be a library that just invokes a function on stack overflow\n\nRegardless though, I think that there should be a `no_split_stack` attribute and there should be a large amount of documentation on the various directions you can take with stack management in rust.\n",
