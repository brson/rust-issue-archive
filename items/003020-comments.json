    "body": "I'm not sure I follow what this would mean -- pipes are 1-1, so either this means sending on multiple pipes (which can be done with a vector iteration and doesn't need to be a primitive), or sending on a pipe whose other endpoint is a SharedChan. Conceivably this could mean iterating a `try_send` until it fails, but there's no way for a `Port` to know if its `Chan` is shared or not, let alone atomically make sure a woken receiver doesn't receive again before the broadcast is finished.\n",
