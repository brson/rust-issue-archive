    "body": "The infinite loop is an unfortunate side effect of failing. Right now whenever a task fails, it will print that it fails _before_ checking to see whether it's already failing. If this printing raises a condition (an I/O error), then you'll fail because of no handler and start the cycle all over again.\n\nThe infinite loop would be better dealt with if the condition weren't raised on (or caught explicitly), but the condition definitely shouldn't be raised after #9901 lands. Regardless, I believe that removing conditions will help expose the error going on here so we can deal with it better.\n",

Not really a great long term solution (since two failing tasks would then race on the set/unset of the global flag), but it at least yields a more reasonable stack to traverse in gdb.\n",
