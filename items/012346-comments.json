    "body": "As the 1.0 release is focused on the API stability of the standard library, I don't think that this is going to happen in the mainline distribution. The shipped version of `libmarkdown` (if we create one), will be intentionally gated off with `#![experimental]`. We do have a number of libraries in this situation (see the lists on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18585), as well as a theoretical strategy for dealing with how to ship them.\n\nTimes have changed since this bug was created, however, and we primarily now have Cargo. I think for now we'd have a difficult time refactoring `librustdoc` to extract the `Markdown` implementation in any sort of a usable fashion, so I'm going to close this for now because we're able to have a high-quality markdown crate in the Cargo ecosystem rather than the standard library itself.\n\nWe can certainly investigate bringing in an excellent implementation for use by rustdoc as well!\n",
