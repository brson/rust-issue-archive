    "body": "For a long while rustc was adding '-lm' to the linker flags and nobody knew why so we removed it. I am very curious about why this is happening and why it happens specifically when building a rustc test runner.\n\nI suspect that linking libm to every crate is ultimately not the right thing to do, since rust code doesn't have any inherent dependency on it nor does the runtime link to it.\n\nIf we can't figure out what the real issue is then maybe we have to do this, but this time with comments explaining why.\n",
