    "body": "This is more possible with today's rustbuild build system, but I think it's pretty unlikely to happen for awhile. We're bootstrapping from nightlies so we do actually have a libstd to use, but a prerequisite for this is probably to get the compiler off unstable APIs from the standard library, which would likely be a pretty major effort in itself.\n\nFor now though I'm gonna close as hopefully rustbuild targets a number of concerns with build times and such, and also targets the concern of building with a stable rustc (as in theory `cargo build` would \"just work\" if it's only using stable libstd APIs)\n",
