    "body": "Semi-related: I have been wondering whether we should start distributing a wrapper script for invoking `bin/rustc` that sets up the `[DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and other environment variables appropriately.\n\nI saw a user recently who untarred the `tar.gz` binary package and tried to copy `bin/rustc` into a different location.  I advised them to \"just install it globally\", but I would prefer to have some support for the use case where you do _not_ install the distribution into `/usr/...`.  I have been maintaining my own private script for supporting this, but it would probably be good to determine what our general attitude is about this.  (That is, if the team thinks we can stomach supporting a wrapper script, then I can work on making my own script more robust and making it distributable.  If the team hates the idea of a wrapper script ... well, then that's unfortunate given that we've also discarded using rpaths...)\n\n---\n\nUpdate: Oh, the reason that this is related to this topic is that a wrapper script can be written to support multiple release channels, either by having multiple scripts that point to the different spots as necessary, or by having a single script that reflectively dispatches on `$0`, i.e. guessing based on whether we see `beta` or `nightly` in the script's name.\n",

You probably don\u2019t want to import it as-is into the Gentoo packaging system, but you could take ideas. Specifically, it \"installs\" different Rust versions in different directories. (It just extracts tarballs with pre-built binaries, but I believe it\u2019s equivalent to building with `./configure --prefix=/something`.) Then, wrapper scripts run executables from one install or another after setting up the environment, most importantly the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.\n",
