    "body": "If my understanding is correct, hexadecimal floats in C/C++ are there because decimal floats are not guaranteed to round correctly [1]. In Rust, however, after #27307---I suspect this is not necessarily intentional though!---*almost all* decimal floats (#31407 describes edge cases that are practically irrelevant) should round to the nearest, so you can just give rustc an appropriate number (say, 30) of fractional digits and will get the correctly rounded number. This would be a \"practical\" answer for now.\r\n\r\nOne thing for which I still think hexadecimal floats are relevant is a conversion from C/C++. You wouldn't want to convert all hexadecimal floats to decimal yourself :) I have recently written an experimental procedural macro that does exactly this, converting hexadecimal floats to decimal floats (that rustc can understand), but had been reluctant to release one because the status quo was not actually guaranteed so far---it's a pure luck in my opinion. If there is a way to construct a float with exact bit pattern only from constexprs I will adapt that.\r\n\r\n[1] For example, ISO C99 only requires that decimal floats should be converted to a representable number within \u00b11.5 ulps (\"the result is either the nearest representable value, or the larger or smaller representable value immediately adjacent to the nearest representable value\").",
