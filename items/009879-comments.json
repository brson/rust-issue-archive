    "body": "IMO, Rust got it right by putting the inner type of a vector inside rather than before the braces (i.e. `[int]` rather than `int[]`). I'm eager in preserving that property, even if it does make the fixed-length syntax a little more unsightly.\n\nPersonally I don't have an issue with `[T, ..n]` on its own. However, now that we've introduced the three-dot ellipsis into the parser (as per #10064), I do worry a little that we'll be tempted to use it elsewhere, and without a clear and memorable meaning for these symbols we risk people never being able to remember when to use `..` vs when to use `...`. So then, _is_ `..` our \"repeat\" operator? And is this consistent with all the contexts in which it is used?\n\nAs for proposals, I really want to avoid overloading `:` even more (especially if we plan on going through with pcwalton's generalized type ascription syntax one day). Maybe we could do something with `#`? `[int#5]`, perhaps. Though I don't think that really looks any better than the current syntax.\n",

(cc #10064)  Compare: `[int, ...32]` vs `[int, ..32]`. Three dots somehow looks more _intensional_ to me, whereas `..` looks like it could have been a typo. But is this vague reasoning enough to cause us to modify existing code? Probably not. I should have spoken up earlier I guess!\n",
