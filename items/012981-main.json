  "body": "This commit adds an artificial and \"very high\" bound on the size of an unbounded\nasynchronous channel. An unbounded channel runs the risk of memory exhaustions,\nresulting in a process abort (currently OOM is not a fail!()). This is often a\ndisastrous failure mode, so instead this commit attempts to mitigate some of the\nworry by imposing a large limit which will theoretically get triggered before\nhitting OOM.\n\nThis commit also adds an ability to sidestep these assertions by using the\n`unchecked_channel` method to create a Sender/Receiver pair. This function is\ncurrently marked as `#[experimental]` due to leaking implementation\nabstractions.\n",
