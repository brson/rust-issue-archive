    "body": "How common is utf16 c strings outside of windows api compatibility? I thought that it was quite rare, which would make me think that a trait in the `c_str` module doesn't quite fit. If we do go with this, I find it odd that `to_c_str()` returns a `CString` and `to_c_utf16_str()` returns `Vec<u16>`. I think that `Vec<u16>` is an ok type to use, and I like that it uses RAII and not closures, but this seems like it may just want to change `as_utf16_p` in the `win32` module to just returning a `Vec<u16>`.\n",

    "body": "Hmm, the patch doesn't seem necessary as I initially thought - I thought `as_utf16_p` should be renamed to `with_utf16_p` and it'd be better if it is available regardless of OS (so added a trait at `c_str`).\nBut I now think there's too small usage of the trait outside of windows, while (re-)implementing `as_utf16_p` is still easy for such cases.\n",
