The `configure` script indicates that Python is needed for LLVM, but LLVM's docs say it only needs Python for its tests, and we (thankfully) don't run LLVM tests. Perhaps there is some flag that enables them, but by default that is not the case. Furthermore, `configure` seems to accept Python versions as old as 2.4 (or rather, rejects 2.3 because \"LLVM requires Python 2.4-2.7\") when provided with a `--python=<path>` argument, though as @tshepang found it will look for only 2.6/2.7 in the absence of this argument. But LLVM 2.8's docs state that Python \">=2.7\" is required (from lurking on the llvm-dev mailing list, I recall that this does **not** include 3.x).\n\nAs if all that wasn't bad enough, we have a number of Python scripts in `src/etc/` with no easy way to tell what Python version those require. Not all of those scripts are part of the normal build/development process (for example, some generate tables of precomputed constants). At a glance, I saw one use of the `with` statement in `featurechk.py`which gives us a lower bound of 2.6 for a normal process. It's also quite possibly that some 2.7 features have slipped in.\n\nHonestly I would be in favor of just requiring 2.7 regardless of whether anything even needs it.
