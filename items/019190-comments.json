    "body": "I've made a couple prototype implementations of this feature in rustdoc and discovered where the pain points are for me. For 1.0, I think the best thing would be a more conservative implementation of this feature, designed to accommodate the most common uses of `Deref` found in the standard library. This feature could always be made more accomodating later to support more exotic deref types, of course.\n\nWe absolutely need to be able to inline methods for these very commonly used, and often asked about, standard library deref pairs:\n- `str` methods on `String` (`&self` only, because there is no `DerefMut` impl)\n- `[T]` methods on `Vec<T>` (`&self` and `&mut self`)\n\nAnother nice to have would be additional sections on the `Vec` docs for methods available on, say, `Vec<u8>`, via autoderef to `&[u8]` and `&mut [u8]`.\n\nOther, more exotic `Deref` impls using where clauses and fancy generics and whatnot can be supported later.\n",
