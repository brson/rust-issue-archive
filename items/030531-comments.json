To fix this `:` would need to be removed from `FOLLOW(ident)` (and [`FOLLOW(block)` as well](http://is.gd/toG3MQ)), but that would be another breaking change :( . Of course type ascription is also a breaking change as evidenced by this issue, so it's one against the other. At least perhaps a lint could be added to catch this situation where type ascription influences macro expansion.\n",

    "body": "> validating the set of rewrite rules as a whole set of composed alternatives\n\nTo be clear, what I meant by this is that we might be able to walk across all of the rules in parallel, maintaining multiple cursors into the rules, rather than separately with a single cursor, and have the `FOLLOW` set for each token depend upon where all the cursors are located.  Right now the `FOLLOW(ident)` is the whole universe of tokens.  But what I'm thinking is that if you have one cursor pointing at an `expr` and another at an `ident` (representing the idea that the macro expander could eventually be trying to decide which rewrite arm to use), then the `FOLLOW` for that `ident` would be much more restricted, perhaps e.g. `FOLLOW(ident) = FOLLOW(expr)` in that context (or maybe it would need to be even _more_ restricted, I'm not sure).\n",

    "body": "So, @brson and I were just talking about this. I think my preferred solution is to fix the \"macro future proofing RFC\", since it seems obvious that this is basically a bug in that RFC and it is not achieving its aims. However, the precise best way to do that -- and the fallout from doing so -- is unknown.\n\nIn the meantime, perhaps the most prudent course of action is to either disable parsing of type ascription or else to require that a type ascription expression occurs within parentheses (`(<expr>: T)`). The latter would be better but harder. That way, we can avoid breakage while we have this discussion.\n\nLonger term, it seems _likely_ but not certain that this crate will eventually break, but hopefully that is because we tighten the macro future-proofing RFC, and not as an unintentional side-effect of adding a new expression form. Alternatively, if we decide we cannot fix the macro future-proofing RFC, we will have to be very careful about adding new expression forms, and probably wind up limiting ourselves to forms that require parentheses or are otherwise unambiguous.\n",

    "body": "We discussed this issue in yesterday's @rust-lang/lang meeting. The rough consensus was that we should **not** revert the type ascription change (nor other future extensions to the expression grammar). The bug here is that these macro definitions were accepted in the first place, basically, and we hope soon to revise the macro rules to correct that. \n\nFor some background: when we released 1.0, we set some parameters for what sorts of changes we could make to the Rust grammar. In particular, for things like expressions and types, which can be referenced from macro definitions, we established (in [RFC 550](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0550-macro-future-proofing.md)) a set of [legal \"follow\" tokens](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0550-macro-future-proofing.md#follownt) that must never be added to the grammar. For example, the follow set for an expression was defined as `=>`, `,`, and `;`. These sets were derived by looking at the existing Rust grammar and finding expression terminators we were already committed to: for example, expressions can already be followed by `,` in a tuple expression or function call. **Under those rules, the change to implement type ascription is legal.**\n\n[RFC 550](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0550-macro-future-proofing.md) also defined a static analysis that was intended to reject macro definitions which might be affected by (legal) changes to the expression grammar. For example, that analysis would reject a macro arm such as `$e:expr : $t:ty` because, there, `$e` is followed by `:`, which is not in the follow set for an expression. This means that if we were to add something like type ascription, the macro would break, and we did not want that to happen. However, as this issue demonstrates, that static anlysis contains a \"soundness bug\" when it comes to multiple macro arms.\n\nIn the medium to long term, we need to patch [RFC 550](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0550-macro-future-proofing.md) to correctly account for multiple macro arms. In the short term, however, macro authors will have to look at their own macros to check whether they might be broken by changes to the extension grammar. \n\nWe considered reverting the addition of type ascription but decided against it. Basically, once we fix [RFC 550](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0550-macro-future-proofing.md), those crates that are affected by type ascription are going to break anyway. On balance, it seems better to regress them **now** and gain type ascription (and the `?` operator, etc) than to wait and regress them later. **That said, it does imply that we need to be careful about phasing in new syntax -- warning periods may be required to help people adapt to changing macro definitions.** In this case, the fallout seems to be relatively limited, but it's something to be aware of going forward. (We considered going back and trying to add a warning period for this case, but it is fairly non-trivial to implement, and given the limited fallout doesn't seem justified, though I at least would welcome such a PR if someone did do it.)\n",

I can't come up with an example where `#![feature(type_ascription)]` changes the behavior of a one-arm macro (besides causing it to accept more invocations, of course), though there may be something I didn't think of. But I'm still not sure whether to blame the hole on arm interaction or not.\n",
