While you're at it if you feel motivated, `'x'` probably doesn't need the `'` characters around the literal because it should already be separated as a small code block. Just a preference though, I don't mind either way.\n",

    "body": "I don't think there's really a good convention on it one way or another. I've never been that impressed with github's code review tools. It's unfortunate that all history is lost in the github review if you rebase, but I generally think that it's fine to rebase.\n\nThankfully if you do comment on the commit itself github still  marks the old comments with \"show outdated diff\", so  at least there's a small consolation. If you comment on the overall pull request diff though I have absolutely no idea what github does to track those between revisions.\n\nAnyway, thanks for putting up with me :)\n",
