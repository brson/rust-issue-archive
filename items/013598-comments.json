For example, if we need to impose this restriction to avoid import cycles, I can accept that.  But I want to make sure we did not just accidentally regress this feature without consideration.)\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I guess from my POV, I do not see `use a::...` as synonymous with `use self::...`\n\nIt makes sense to me that `use a::...` would be restricted to the public interface of `a`; from my POV, one would like `use a::[STUFF]` to have the same meaning at any valid use-decl context within a given crate (i.e. I would like to be able to freely cut and paste such use-decls down into other fns or mods), and that would require restricting `use a::...` to the public interface of `a`.\n\nBut `use self::[STUFF]` cannot possibly enjoy the same property.  It cannot have the same meaning in other mods within the crate.  So it would make sense to me for it to obey different rules about lookup, where it would have access to the non-pub names that have been imported into the current mod.\n",
