    "body": "So I just looked at this again. It looks like \"Blocks can deinitialize upvars\" isn't actually true -- I tried it, and got \"error: assigning to upvar\". So it doesn't look like any kind of assignment to upvars is allowed, including move. So that's good.\n\nAs for closing over things with constraints on them, is that really a problem? Closing over non-function-typed upvars shouldn't be a problem, as upvars can only be read and not written. Also, only top-level known functions can have constraints on them -- there are no unknown functions whose types are known to have a constraint. So I _think_ this is a non-issue as well.\n\nCan I safely close this?\n",
