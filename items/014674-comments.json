In this particular case, it might be possible to just panic!() (and have us get all the nice things that come with panicing, like an optional backtrace).\n\nTo avoid adding heuristics to detect this case, it might make sense to just have oom try to panic first, but detect recursion and in that event execute a simpler non-allocating bailout.\n\nThe above would actually be fairly helpful even if we keep the plain call to abort().\n",

    "body": "@jmesmon I believe it's possible to `panic` with a static allocation, if the handler checks for that case (and doesn't treat the pointer as a `Box<T>`).\nThen you're left with allocations in destructors, which are rare (I don't recall a single one, actually. unless it's a panicking destructor).\nEven if there are spurious allocations, they may still not hit the OOM condition - basically what you're saying, AFAICT.\n\nOh, I see @alexcrichton mentions optimizing allocations.\nThat makes it trickier, if `nounwind` actually results in significant optimizations around allocations.\nThere's still the choice to invoke the backtrace machinery and then `abort`, if you have a hook for that in `liballoc`.\ncc @dotdash\n",
