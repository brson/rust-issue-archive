  "body": "Allows DSTs to be sized generically at runtime.\n\ncore::mem::{size/align/min_align}_of_val have also been slightly altered\nto use the new intrinsics, and to also allow DSTs.\n\nDoesn't work for DST enums and tuples, because I had nothing to test with to ensure it works. Taking a pointer to a DST enum or tuple is currently an ICE(#16812). Would it be better to wait until that ICE is fixed before doing this? Would it be better to add skeleton functionality that _should_ work once the ICE is fixed?\n\nTrait Objects currently seem to only store `min_align` in their vtables (presuming that [this](http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/01/peeking-inside-trait-objects/) is correct? My tests suggest that the value stored there matched `min_align` rather than `pref_align`, at least) so `pref_align_of_val` will just return that for now. Is that okay?\n\ncloses #19063\n",
