    "body": "Rust's libraries greatly favor composition over specific functions such as this. As with your other issues about new macros, these are mostly conveniences and don't particularly serve any fundamental purpose.\n\nThe existing macros in `libstd/macros.rs` should all exist because of a fundamental reason. For example, `format!` could never be a library function because it takes a variable number of arguments on which is has special constraints. The macros you have proposed often do not have a fundamental reason to be macros, and would work well with simple functions instead.\n\nFor this reason, I'm going to close this and the associated issues about macros. Issues can be created about adding convenience functions if you like, but I do not believe that this functionality belongs in macros.\n",
