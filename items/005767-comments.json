    "body": "This sounds reasonable at first, but I'm not sure if I agree with this. It seems to rule out very legitimate use cases. In the borrow checker, for example, we build up little trees representing loan paths. I use `@` because it's convenient. And I compare them for equality. It seems like we wouldn't be able to do that under this proposal, because we would already have hardwired `@` comparison to be pointer only.\n\nMaybe I'm too blase about infinite loops, but I kind of feel like cycles in eq are....not our problem. You can always implement your own version of Eq for types that may contain cyclic references, nobody forced you to derive it.\n",
