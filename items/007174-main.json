  "body": "This change prevents the indentation in code blocks inside the /// doc comments\nfrom being eaten. The indentation that is the same across the consecutive doc\ncomments is removed by the uindent_pass in librustdoc.\n\nThe bug can be seen, e.g., here: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/std/iterator.html#example-12\n\nI also altered how the block comments are treated, for consistency. There isn't much testing done on the documentation output (I added a few tests of my own for the modified function), so I don't know if anything relied on the previous behavior. I checked a number of documentation files and observed either no change in output or changes that consistent of the above bug being fixed.\n",
