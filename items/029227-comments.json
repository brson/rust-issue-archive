Certainly it's not something that I fully understood we were\ndoing. In particular, I think that\n\n```\nmatch v { CONSTANT => true, _ => false }\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nv == CONSTANT\n```\n\nshould always be equivalent, _if_ both of them compile. (I could imagine\nthat the match version might not always compile). The current behavior of\nconverting constants into patterns obviously doesn't preserve this\nequivalence, which seems pretty wrong to me, but it also doesn't work very\nwell with things like associated constants.\n\nOn Fri, Oct 23, 2015 at 3:21 AM, Eduard-Mihai Burtescu <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @nikomatsakis https://github.com/nikomatsakis I believe I've seen MIR\n> building turn constant patterns not into plain x == constant but PartialEq::eq(&x,\n> &constant) - wouldn't that be a bug, given that patterns need to be pure?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29227#issuecomment-150495908.\n",
