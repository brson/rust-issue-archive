It's kind of annoying because I also use `left`/`right` for layout alignments that shouldn't change between LTR and RTL.\n\nI don't think we need to deprecate these methods. A documentation tweak could clarify the current implications on their behavior. Do we even have a way to detect an RTL configuration anyways? Perhaps this is best left to an external crate to implement these methods as a precursor to a more general localization framework. \n",

Consistently trimming at the start/end no matter the direction of text seems likely to be the desired behaviour in most circumstances (i.e. even ones that encounter non-LTR text).\n",

    "body": "**Libs team consensus**: for now, we should make sure the documentation is clear about exactly what's happening here. In the long run, we'd be interested in a deprecation/renaming, but we'd like to have some better tools in place to do so. \n\nThe problem is that if we just deprecate it normally, all crates using the functionality have to choose between deprecation messages and upping the version of Rust they require. Neither choice is great.\n\nThe core team has discussed the idea of regular \"long term support\" releases, or otherwise some way to flag releases in a coarser-grained way. That can be useful for deprecations like this -- they would give something more like a small \"epoch of Rust\" to attach things like deprecations to, rather than forcing lib authors to just arbitrarily require Rust v1.7+ or whatever.\n\nMore broadly, we'd like to establish a policy for this kind of minor cleanup -- where the change makes things more clear, but doesn't close any fundamental holes or anything.\n",
