    "body": "I've become disillusioned with the idea of having real dynamically sized types for vectors. I don't really see any major win. The big thing seems to be that we can make our evec syntax `~[]` and `@[]` in a principled and compositional way.\nEven so, a lot of special casing will still be required, and we need to deal with adding a notion of dynamically sized types to the type system and figuring out what operations will be permitted on them. It seems to me that it will _increase_ implementation complexity, not decrease it, and won't provide any real user facing benefit.\n\nI think that what we want to do is leave the type system as is but make `~[]` and `@[]` be special cased to be syntax for evecs.\n",
