  "body": "This PR adds a nicer wrapper around the volatile intrinsics. It also places the new volatile module under unstable.\n\nI added the following types:\n- `VolatilePtr`\n- `VolatileInt`\n- `VolatileBool`\n\nThere is also static types that deal with the specialized types (such as `VolatileBool` and `VolatileInt`)\n-  `INIT_VOLATILE_BOOL`\n- `INIT_VOLATILE_INT`\n\nThese can be used basically the same way Atomics are used (I think). \n\nSomethings to consider:\n- I'm not sure if the static API/method is correct\n- Only two specialized types exist (`int` and `bool`). Other types are super easy to add.\n- The `VolatilePtr` doesn't work with pure values, because there needs to be a destination pointer for the intrinsics. One way I can think of allowing this directly (without using another variable) is to reserve a new memory region, with the size based on the passed type, and copying the data over to that region.\n\nI added tests for all the current functionality and they all pass on my machine.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I need to change, add, remove, etc...\n",
