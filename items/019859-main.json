  "body": "This test would read with a timeout and then send a UDP message, expecting the\nmessage to be received. The receiving port, however, was bound in the child\nthread so it could be the case that the timeout and send happens before the\nchild thread runs. To remedy this we just bind the port before the child thread\nruns, moving it into the child later on.\n\ncc #19120\n",
