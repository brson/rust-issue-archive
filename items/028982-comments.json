It is a choice between having to do `session_leader(true).tty(fd)` every time, and having `.session_leader(false).tty(fd)` not do what it says (because what it says cannot be done).

    "body": "@nagisa I understand wanting to be able to undo any setting on the `Command`, but that currently isn't possible for many other settings (e.g. `args()`), and only indirectly possible for most of the rest (e.g. to remove all set env vars, you'd have to call `env_clear()` and then rebuild setting the inherited env vars). `session_leader()` is the odd one out here in taking a boolean value, more on this below.\n\n@alexcrichton Being able to run a closure after the fork is definitely the solution to everyone's problem. Literally none of the functionality in `os::unix::CommandExt` would need to be in `std` if that were available. Reading old issues, though, it seemed like that had a soundness issue I didn't fully understand that blocks it for now. If there's not a soundness issue, I'd be glad to implement that also.\n\nI also don't think that setting controlling terminal is niche, though: its a fundamental part of job control just like creating a new session. Passing in termios flags and window size parameters (which `fork_pty(3)` accepts) is what I'd say is niche, but that's all possible to write in a third party library if std will let us set an fd as the controlling tty.\n\nMerging these two conversation streams, I'd actually say that creating a new session and setting the ctty for that session are deeply coupled behaviors. Currently the API lets you create a new session, but only one without a controlling terminal. I think the actual best API here is for `session_leader()` to take an `Option<&T> where T: AsRawFd`, which will be made into the controlling terminal for the session of the child process. My branch has been updated to reflect the new proposed API. I think being able to unset the various configurations on the process builder is a separate conversation, though.\n\n(I've incidentally removed a misleading comment from the docs, though it seems out of place that the API docs for session_leader gives instructions on how to create a daemon in the first place.)\n",

    "body": "@withoutboats Ah yeah I agree that most of the extension trait on unix may not be necessary, but that doesn't mean we should remove all the methods! It's definitely nice for us to handle some of the most common use cases (like this if it turns out to be that way) in the standard library itself. The purpose of the escape hatch \"run this closure\" would just be to provide _any_ ability to do this externally so this sort of functionality could grow outside first.\n\nI also think old issues about safety and such don't necessarily matter so much, this may need to be `unsafe` but beyond that there shouldn't be anything fundamentally impossible about this I believe.\n",

Obviously having to pass a closure to the child to run after the fork is not very convenient and shouldn't be the only way to set up the child. I do think that it doesn't make a lot of sense to support `session_leader()` without supporting setting the controlling terminal of the new session.\n\nI'll look into opening a separate PR with a run-after-fork closure. I think the closure would be an `FnOnce() -> ()`?\n",
