    "body": "So for the original installer, both the installer and the uninstaller\nseems to think that the path is empty (and gives a warning to that\neffect). That probably explains why it just splats it with the rust\npath and nothing else (it mistakenly thinks the path is empty). The\nonly thing I can think of off the top of my head is that it's reading\nthe user's path but writing the system's path (the second half of that\nstatement is definitely true at least!), since my user path is empty.\n\nThe second installer seems to append the path to the user's PATH\nvariable. This works, however windows installers normally give you the\noption of installing just for yourself, or for everyone (the latter\noption would put it on the system's path).\n\nThe version of rustc.exe installed with that second installer hangs\nafter compiling. If I kill it, the executable produced seems to work\nthough. Perhaps I'll dig through it later and find you a call stack.\n\nSeb\n\nOn Tue, Jan 24, 2012 at 7:30 PM, Graydon Hoare\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> http://venge.net/graydon/rust-0.2-install.exe might also \u00a0be worth taking a look at, if you trust Random Binaries From Me.
