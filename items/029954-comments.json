Is it possible that the right fix to #29857 is just to change `ty_is_local_constructor` to not panic and instead return true or false or maybe even a `Result`? This would be basically more inline with the usual error strategy, which is that when you see an error result, you should suppress all downstream errors.\n\nOTOH maybe it's ok to have trait selection fail and we just suppress the output of failed trait selection (which I know we attempt to do anyway). \n",

    "body": "@arielb1 \n\n> I should really be reading my e-mails more often.\n\nNo worries, me too. :)\n\n> The root cause of the problem here is normalize_to_error again. It means that candidate evaluation can give us some TyErrors, and if we get unlucky the TyError can mix in with the underlying selection candidate. I think that just moving the selection predicate ahead of the projection in evaluation order would fix this - I will try that later today - but I am not sure whether that is a better idea.\n\nSo I think what you are saying here is that, but for `normalize_to_error`, we would not be seeing `TyError` at all, and if you reordered things, we might restore that invariant? That seems...fine, but it seems like being prepared for `TyError` is also a perfectly fine thing to do.\n",

Still, it's not obvious to me how this could happen, I'd expect that such an error would be reported during the WF phase. Anyway, it's clear we have to land SOME patch here. I am going to briefly experiment with a patch that is more accepting of type-error today, then we can make a final decision.\n",
