    "body": "This semester has turned out to be rather busy, so I won't be able to work on this for a week. Feel free to close this PR to clear up bors's queue.\n\n@bstrie: I plan to look into the \"cannot move out of dereference of {@, &} pointer\" error once I'm done with this one (since I hate that error with a passion).\n\n@nikomatsakis: I'd like some feedback on an approach I plan to take. When both `sub_r` and `sup_r` have named lifetimes, we have to decide which should replace which. For the following function,\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a Foo) -> (&'b int, &'a int) {\n    (&x.bar, &x.bar)\n}\n```\n\nit would be wrong to replace `&'a Foo` with `&'b Foo`. Instead, we should replace `&'b int` with `&'a int`. A heuristic we could use is to always give `sub_r` (return value) the lifetime name of `sup_r` (argument), but it's unclear to me if that always work.\n\nWhat I plan to do is, first, collect all the SubSupConflict where `sub_r` and `sup_r` are free and have the same `sup_r` (unless there's the case where a return value has to have the same lifetime as two parameters). From those, I would create a `replace` set, which tentatively consists of NodeId of places I would have to replace, and extract their lifetime names into a `same_lifetime` set. Then I would walk through the parameters and the output to check for places where the lifetime name is in `same_lifetime`, and if it is, I add that NodeId into `replace`. Finally, I walk through `replace` to start rebuilding the function declaration.\n\nSo for the following function,\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a Foo) -> (&'b int, &'a int, &int) {\n    (&x.bar, &x.bar, &x.bar)\n}\n```\n\nwe would get `SubSupConflict(&'b int, &'a Foo)` and `SubSupConflict(&int, &'a Foo)`. If we pretend that the NodeId of the parameter and the three items in the return tuple are 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively, our `replace` set would be `{1, 2, 4}` and `same_lifetime` set would be `{'a, 'b}`. Then when we walk through the inputs and output and see that the `'b` in `&'b int` is in `same_lifetime`, so `3` should also be added into `replace`. Finally, we generate a name, say `'c`, and give them all the same name, which would give us: `(x: &'c Foo) -> (&'c int, &'c int, &'c int)`.\n",

    "body": "So this pull request looks pretty good! This is very close to what I had in mind. I am pleased we were able to do it purely in error reporting. I suspect that it would also be good to investigate and improve the code that selects what inputs to provide to error reporting as well, but that's a separate question.\n\n@ktt3ja as far as your question concerning a more advanced example, I don't necessarily think we need to solve that particular problem, but I'll not that it's not necessarily wrong to suggest replacing `'a` with `'b` or vice versa. It seems like the key thing would be remove the unused lifetime parameter from the list. Nonetheless, I'm less concerned about cases where the user gave two lifetime names and they didn't match -- much more concerned about anonymous lifetime parameters.\n\nI think the best thing to do would be to cleanup this patch a bit (for example, to find a good lifetime name, perhaps search through `'a` ... `'z` to find one that is unused?) and land it as is. If you have more time and want to go further, I suspect we can improve the algorithms in region inference that select the two regions to report errors about.\n",

I want to get the message as simple as possible.\n\nThat said, maybe leave the code commented out or in some way disabled that iterates over and reports more details.

I'm unsure how hard it would be to support methods--I would need to run it on some test cases to get a better understanding, and unfortunately I can't work on it right now. I would prefer that this lands for now so that we get bug report for things I may have overlooked.\n\nFor your last two paragraphs, do you mean that we don't report the type/inference errors at all, and change the suggestion span note into an error? Do you want it to go with this PR?\n",
