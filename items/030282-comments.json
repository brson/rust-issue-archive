    "body": "The function was actually inlined. If you check the IR, you'll see that there's no call to `teeest`, neither a direct, nor an indirect one. \n\nWhat's happening is that inside the `black_box` call, you have a closure that captures `func`, so the closure environment holds a reference to the `teeest` function. And by putting that into the `black_box` call, you stop the compiler from removing it. So the function is only kept because its address has been taken. It has been properly inlined and it is never actually called.\n",
