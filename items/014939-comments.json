    "body": "The ability to use single-pass hashing instead of state machines is important and seems to be missing or at least not leveraged. At the moment, Rust's SipHash implementation is _far slower_ than a naive C implementation, and that's without getting into the large gains you can get by using SIMD.\n\n> but the FNV hashing should satisfy much of the need for speedier hashing.\n\nI don't think that's a satisfactory workaround. In addition to not providing protection against pathological data (DoS attacks), FNV is also a very weak hash and suffers from many collisions even with random inputs. It's also not the default hash, and the out-of-the-box performance is what matters most. AFAIK, a proper SipHash implementation is significantly faster in terms of cycles per byte than FNV, and should be winning on large keys where the initial cost becomes less significant.\n",
