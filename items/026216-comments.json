The only argument I could understand is that it increases page load (but that's only relevant for the online version) and you can improve that by using CDN's + local fallback. \n\nIs there another argument against it?\n\n@alexcrichton I used Open Sans from google fonts so it's not added to the repo. It does show up when you browse locally and have a an internet connection. But if it doesn't load it's no problem at all because you fall back on the old font ;)\n\n> Could you put up a copy online of the entire book to browse and compare?\n\nI think I can :) I will post a link when it's done\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton @steveklabnik here is the link: http://www.mathieudavid.org/test/rustbook/patch1/\n\nI am working on a version to change font style at the moment I have included FontAwesome through CDN link I will add a local fallback to use words instead of icons when it doesn't load (for offline support). Once done I will put it online for you to review.\nIf then you still think that FontAwesome should not be included I will remove it and do only word menu :)\n\n**Update:**\nI have a really nice animation that hides the sidebar when a button is pressed. It needs a little bit more testing, but it seems to work correctly on all screen sizes.\n\nFor the variable font-sizes, it's a little trickier than I thought. I have to convert all the font-size to `em` instead of `px`. But that is defined in the shared css with rustdoc and I am too afraid to break things in the docs.. The ideal solution would be to separate the css for the book completely. This would also make it a tiny bit less dependant on rustdoc. And it would also make it possible to make multiple themes.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**Update 2:**\nI put online what I already had, you can check it out [here](http://www.mathieudavid.org/test/rustbook/patch2/). It's not done yet, but it is fancy ;)\n\nJust to be clear, this is not in the PR (yet)\n",

But I'm not sure what I have to modify. ~~I guess I will have to modify the make file to copy over those static assets to the \"production\" folder, but I have no clue how?~~ **edit:** I found a way in the `build.rs` file from the rustbook.\n\nAlso it would be super convenient to add a make target like `make trpl-static` that would just copy the static files without rebuilding the rust code, for when you only modified the css or js.\n",

Could this maybe be discussed on the internal forum, to see what others think about it?\n- It's not downloaded locally, meaning that it's not yet another dependency\n- If this font fails to load (for example offline), the next font on the list is used, that is the current font. So it's not like it would fail to render.\n- Open Sans is one of the most widely used fonts from google CDN, there is a very very big chance that the user already has it in his browser cache, so he probably doesn't even need to reload it (= improved page load)\n\nAnd I think it's easier on the eye, but that's a matter of personal taste ;)\n\n---\n\n**Was there a change with `make trpl`?**\nThe behavior changed on my computer, now it rebuilds everything every time I run this command, taking hours.. :/\n",
