The implementation of `C` for `int` breaks this contract, because there the function `test` cannot be called with a trait just implementing `A`. Shouldn't arguments in subtypes of traits be [contravariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_%28computer_science%29#Contravariant_method_argument_type), e.g. the call `fn test<T: A>(&self, x: T)` should be valid for every implementation of that trait. With contravariant arguments, the following would be possible:\n\n```\ntrait A {\n    fn foo();\n}\n\ntrait B: A {\n     fn bar();\n}\n\ntrait C {\n    fn test<T: B>(&self, x: T);\n}\n\nimpl C for  int {\n    fn test<T: A>(&self, x: T) {\n         x.foo();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation of trait `C` does not break it's contract, because the function `test` for `int` could be called with an argument with type `B`, because the type in the implementation is more general.\n",

I've added a simple run-pass testcase with contravariant arguments.\n\nThe patch in it's current form requires the bounds to be unique, so the following definition would be problematic:\n\n```\ntrait C {\n    fn test<T: Eq + Eq>(&self);\n}\n\nimpl C for  int {\n    fn test<T: Eq + Eq >(&self) {}\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure if a bound definition with non-unique traits should be valid.
