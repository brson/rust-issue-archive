    "body": "@klutzy is [correct in the diagnosis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22628#issuecomment-75372764). The fact that `stdtest` hangs is pretty new to me and I haven't had the chance to investigate it much.\n\nNote that the fix for all the tests in @klutzy's linked comment was to `join` on all threads. I had a patch to use `scoped` but it should have instead been `spawn` + `join`. @Manishearth I see a few linked commits to this issue which add calls to `sleep`, but I believe it is better solved with a `join`.\n\n> Could you dump thread/stack status of hanged process (when this occurs again) using [Process Explorer](https://technet.microsoft.com/ko-kr/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx)? [This article](http://windowsexplored.com/2011/04/28/know-the-stack-or-more-hang-analysis-using-process-explorer/) explains how to see list of threads and stack trace of each thread.\n\nI took a peek, and unfortunately all I could deduce was that a thread was blocked in `accept`. I was unable to get any indication of _which_ `accept` it was blocked in (no symbols were available).\n\n> and changed the max builds per windows slave to 1 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-buildbot/commit/9911005f4df1695a6f09142c02eced4ecf04a218\n\n@brson, why change the max builds? I'm under the impression that the error does not come from this but rather the fact that something just hangs for too long. Killing `stdtest` at the start sounds like a good idea though. Note that this was my impetus for opening #22448.\n",
