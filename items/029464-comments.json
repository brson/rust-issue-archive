    "body": "Thanks for the pull request, and welcome! The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the PR! This unfortunately must be a change to the prelude of the standard library right now as we don't have macro imports or stability, and as a result this requires an RFC to land first (to have some design discussion about this and such). This has also come up before in issues like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14505, so there may be some good historical context there!\n\nFor now, however, I'm going to close this, but if you need help writing an RFC please just let me know!\n",
