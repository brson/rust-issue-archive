  "body": "If a task is spinning in an accept loop, there is currently no method of gracefully shutting it down. This PR introduces a way to do so by cloning the acceptor and implementing a close_accept method to unblocking any pending acceptor.\n\nAs with other I/O methods like this, it is `#[experimental]` from the start and sadly carries with it a good deal of code to support it. Much of the complication is from the fact that you can now concurrently accept on the same socket.\n\nI tried to add a good deal of tests for this change, but another set of eyes is always appreciated!\n",
