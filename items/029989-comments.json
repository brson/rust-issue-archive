The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pnkfelix (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

That way we can support tools nicely (nicer than the current error messages) while also allowing us to evolve the typical error messages without feeling like everything has to be perfect immediately.\n\nFor example, I like Elm's use of color in error message to direct the reader's eye (https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3ti20g/not_rust_specific_compilers_as_assistants_elm_016/), but that's not something that we need to bikeshed immediately. For now just removing the redundant filename to fix #3533 would be a win on its own.\n",

    "body": "@evincarofautumn: GNU paths are very handy. One of the small things that annoys me about Elm's errors is the lack of those paths. They don't need to be repeated constantly like rustc currently does, but it would be a shame to lose them in the interests of going too far towards hiding complexity. I guess with machine-readable errors in the future, it might become easier to make 'beginner' and 'advanced' front-ends for error formatting (that may not be desirable though).\n",

The one that was cited earlier by @evincarofautumn is [this GNU page](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Errors.html), which proposes:\n\n```\nsourcefile:line1.column1-line2.column2: message\nsourcefile:line1.column1-column2: message\nsourcefile:line1-line2: message\n```\n\nInterestingly, we don't seem to do any of those today, and yet emacs correctly highlights regions for me, so it must understand some superset of those formats.  Also, that web page is a bit weird, since it seems to indicate that `line.col` OR `line:col` is fine, implying that e.g. `sourcefile:line:col-line:col:` would be ok too.\n",

For example, it seems somewhat inconsistent to have error messages begin on a new line and `help` messages not. Also, the `->` kind of looks like Rust code, and it won't work \"out of the box\" with emacs (or any other editor, as far as I know), so that seems like a step backwards.\n\nTL;DR we should iterate on this more, but it's going in a good direction -- and we should take care to ensure that editors continue to work well. :)\n",

    "body": "We discussed this at the compiler meeting, conclusions:\n- we are happy to pursue improvements to the formatting of error messages in general, and I am happy to mentor any such effort,\n- we must not break editors which parse our error messages (we can't expect them to use JSON error messages like IDEs, and there is a de facto standard for error formats which we should adhere to, even if that makes error messages less ideal),\n- there was some discussion about exactly what would be an improvement, it is therefore probably better to make PRs which tackle a single change at a time,\n- in particular\n  - grouping errors together with notes/help/etc. seems like a big win,\n  - removing paths from the snippet margins probably a good thing,\n  - removing line numbers from snippets is debatable,\n  - using -> rather than : is a non-starter because of editors\n- we don't want to take changes that are big enough (or breaking enough for editors) that require a legacy error format.\n",
