    "body": "> Perhaps the num_cpus function could just move to the std::os module?\n\nI thought about doing this in the first place, but a reexport seemed more conservative than a move. If it's ok to move the function, I can try that in another PR.\n\n> I also don't think that doc(hidden) is recognized by rustdoc right now. Does it inline the documentation for you?\n\nI probably worded that bad, `doc(hidden)` does hide the docs _in some cases_. What I meant to say is that I tried several (all?) combinations of `doc` attributes (hidden, no_inline, inline) on the reexports (`pub use ...`) in the first commit, but I could only get one of these two outcomes:\n- Both `std::rt::num_cpus` and `std::os::num_cpus` appear in the docs.\n- `num_cpus` doesn't appear in the docs at all.\n\nBut I couldn't the desired outcome: Only `std::os::num_cpus` in the docs - until I changed the visibility of the `util` module to public.\n\nEDIT: Adding `doc(hidden)`/`doc(no_inline)` to the `pub use self::util::num_cpus` in the first commit, does **not** hide `std::rt::num_cpus` from the docs.\n",
