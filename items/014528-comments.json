    "body": "This seems like an absurdly specialized iterator, especially for a single use-case. If we had integral generic parameters, then an iterator that returns `[T, ..N]` would be a more generically useful thing, but a specialized iterator just for adjacent pairs?\n\n`ImmutableVector` defines a method [`chunks()`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/trait.ImmutableVector.html#tymethod.chunks) that does basically what you want, though it returns a `&[T]`. You could try writing the same thing for `StrSlice`, having it return a given number of `char`s at a time (with `&[char]`). Or you could just call `.as_slice()` and use `.chunks()`, as hex parsing means you only care about ASCII chars. You could also use my open PR #14425 for a `.filter_scan()` adaptor to recreate your `Pair` as needed:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut char_iter = data.chars().filter_scan(None, |st, x| st.take().map(|a| (a,x)).or_else(|| { *st = Some(x); None }));\n```\n",

    "body": "Hi guys, thanks for the comments. The efficiency issues and read-after-<code>None</code> are minor issues that I'm happy to fix if the PR would be accepted.\n\nAs for the specialization of this adaptor, I had thought that I had more use-cases than just hexadecimal parsing, but in fact I can't think of one outside of string parsing, in which case it would be much more generally useful to implement <code>.chunks()</code> on <code>StrSlice</code>. So I'm going to close this and maybe come back with that later this weekend.\n",
