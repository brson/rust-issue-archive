    "body": "@alexcrichton The buildbots work because we don't use `--enable-clang` on them as far as I'm aware. The reason for my change is when I was building with `--enable-clang` as well as trying to target android it would pass `-Qunused-arguments` to `arm-linux-androideabi-gcc` which doesn't recognize the flag and thus would fail. I believe @pnkfelix was the one who added it originally. I just moved it to only be added to the build triple's `C[XX]FLAGS`.\n",
