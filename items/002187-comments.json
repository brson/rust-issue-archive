    "body": "Brian's stuff got me to thinking.  To be honest, I don't really understand what the problem with the floating point modules was precisely (I guess I have to go look at core::float?), but I am sure we can solve it through some combination of ifaces/impls, macros, and (eventuaIly) traits. The annoying part is that only the first one exists today, or so we thought: but Brian's module trick essentially gives us C's `#include`, so in fact we do have a kind of macro today (and macros let us build up simple traits, too).\n",

    "body": "Look at core::float. The gist is this: Each function in C lib math exists in one version per datatype (f32, f64, ...). I use native modules that in a first step rename these to identical function names.  After this point all that is wanted is to export the f64 ones as f64, the f32 ones as f32, and whichever happens to be identical to float as float.  Any suggestions welcome but please don't introduce unnecessary wrappers etc, I'd really like to keep this fast. I see traits here more as a means of building a number tower later on (maybe a \"native\" impl that directly links agains a C lib could help).\n",
