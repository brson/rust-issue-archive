  "body": "Note that this is not actually _used_ by default; it is a matter of\nconfiguration still, because you might want to:\n- Compile all .rs files with `rustc %` (where each can be built itself)\n- Compile all .rs files with `rustc some-file.rs` (where you are editing\n  part of a crate)\n- Compile with a different tool, such as `make`. (In this case you might\n  put a `~/.vim/after/compiler/rustc.vim` to match such cases, set\n  makeprg and extend errorformat as appropriate. That should probably go\n  in a different compiler mode, e.g. make-rustc.)\n\nTo try using it, `:compiler rustc`. Then, `:make` on a file you would\nrun `rustc` on will work its magic, invoking rustc. To automate this,\nyou could have something like `autocmd FileType rust compiler rustc` in\nyour Vim config.\n",
