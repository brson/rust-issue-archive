The editor discussion on the [getting started](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-getting-started-developing-Rust) wiki page does link to another page that lists the Sublime Text 2 package. I'm not sure that we should actually mention Sublime Text 2 in the tutorial since it isn't officially supported.\n\nI'm open to suggestions about how to address versioning in docs. rust-lang.org links to the current release docs (not the one you mentioned), but the wiki additionally links to the current docs from the git master branch.\n",

    "body": "Sublime Text 2 is mentioned on the [github tutorial](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md#editing-rust-code) but not on http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/0.3/tutorial.html or http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html, and I was using \"main site\" to refer to both of these, for some reason. I really should have been more clear.  \n\nAs for versioning, when I posted this issue, I wasn't sure how I managed to get to the 0.4 docs. Apparently, it was through the [rust.md introduction](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/doc/rust.md#introduction) which seems to lead to an [0.4 version](http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html) of the docs. The github docs just need to lead to the version of the docs linked to from http://rust-lang.org.\n\nI also forgot that the tarball link on the [github tutorial](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md#getting-started) leads to 0.4.\n\nEdit: I would suggest redirecting http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/{filename} to the \"current version\"  and moving 0.4 to http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/0.4/{filemame}\n\nEdit again: my carets around the word filename didn't work-- I assume they were treated as HTML despite the backslash.\n",
