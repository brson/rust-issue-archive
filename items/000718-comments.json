    "body": "Poking around in gdb reveals that a forwarding fn is being called in an infinite loop.  Two forwarding fns are being generated.  In the executable I'm looking at now, the one for my_b.foo() is called forwarding_fn1 and the one for my_c.foo() is forwarding_fn13.\n\nFirst, the call to my_b.foo() takes us to forwarding_fn1, which takes us to my_a.foo().  This works fine.  Then, the call to my_c.foo() takes us to forwarding_fn13, which takes us to fowarding_fn1.  But then we get stuck on forwarding_fn1.\n\nSo, we don't _always_ get stuck on forwarding_fn1.  We only seem to get stuck when we arrive at it via another forwarding fn.  We call my_c.foo(); my_c protests and says \"oh, no, I'm not self, my_b is!\"; we head to my_b.foo(), but since my_c has already insisted that my_b is self, we don't hear my_b telling us that actually my_a is self.  I'll look at this some more when I get a chance to talk about it with graydon.\n",
