    "body": "We were talking about this with reference to the stabilization of `String`, and the conclusion that we reached is that while we think that `as_str` is probably the right name for this method, we don't necessarily want to change it _right now_. \n\nOnce https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/198 is implemented, then we'll likely just use `foo[]` to get a slice, rather than calling `as_str` explicitly. This means that if we make this migration _now_ all code will have to migrate from `as_slice` to `as_str`, and _then_ migrate from `as_str` to `[]`. In the interest of less churn, we may want to hold off on a change such as this.\n",
