    "body": "@catamorphism I just spent a bit of time digging into this after noticing that this problem affected me everywhere except in subdirectories of /tmp. \n\nThe problem is the os::rename_file here: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustpkg/package_source.rs#L205\n\nIt's calling libc::rename, which is returning -1 and throwing errno 18, cross-device link. So it looks like rustpkg will have to copy and delete instead of rename()ing if using /tmp, or maybe just clone into .rust/src directly. Eridius suggested this in #rust: \"perhaps there should be a dir in .rust that it clones in to, e.g. `.src` (to keep it hidden). It can use a lockfile as well, so subsequent invocations of rustpkg can detect stale half-clones, and tell from the lockfile that their owning rustpkg is dead\".\n",
