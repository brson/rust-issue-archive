    "body": "This looks pretty awesome, thanks @ktossell! There's a few other issues you may be interested in as well:\n- #15688 - I don't think we're exposing full ipv6 addresses \n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/517 - an RFC for the `std::io` module as a whole\n\nIt may be worth dealing with #15688 while rewriting the `IpAddr` types. Also, out of curiosity, is this following the design of another library you're familiar with? We'd probably want most of these functions to start out unstable/experimental, but overall the design seems pretty reasonable to me!\n",

    "body": "I was looking at #15688 and having a hard time trying to come to a conclusion about where the scope identifier should go. I'm leaning toward saying that it should be part of SockAddr, not Ipv6Addr. I'll see if I can make some progress and leave a comment over there.\n\nI'm most familiar with Python's IP address module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html. I mostly copied its features. Some similar modules are https://golang.org/src/net/ip.go and http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ipaddress/0.8.0/.\n\nI think it would also be good to have an IpNetwork (and Ipv4Network/Ipv6Network) and to extend IpAddr further, adding masking (x:IpAddr matches y:IpAddr up to the nth bit, z:IpAddr's 24-bit network address is w:IpAddr). I'm not sure IpNetwork would be totally appropriate to add to libstd by itself, since it's probably not directly required for other core features (like socket support requires IpAddr). But I think it's best to include network utilities (is-address-in-network, what-hosts-are-in-network, is-network-subnetwork-of...) when we're providing IpAddr. Without IpNetwork or comparison functions, IpAddr is much less useful. I guess I better bring all of this up in https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/576...\n",

    "body": "Sorry about being so slow on this @ktossell! At this point I've now [opened an RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/807) for the upcoming `std::net`. It may be nice to summarize these changes and put them in the `Addresses` section of the RFC which currently largely leaves this functionality as an open question.\n\nWould you be willing to help out in writing up a bit summarizing the direction this PR takes? If not I can also try drafting up something and send it over to you for proofing!\n",

This all seemed basically good as-is, so I've rolled it all into the upcoming `std::net` module here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22015.\n\nI'm gonna close this in favor of that now as we'll probably keep `old_io` as-is to prevent breakage.\n",
