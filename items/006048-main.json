  "body": "As part of the numeric trait reform (see issue #4819), I have added the following traits to `core::num` and implemented them for floating point types:\n\n``` rust\npub trait Round {\n    fn floor(&self) -> Self;\n    fn ceil(&self) -> Self;\n    fn round(&self) -> Self;\n    fn trunc(&self) -> Self;\n    fn fract(&self) -> Self;\n}\n\npub trait Fractional: Num\n                    + Ord\n                    + Round\n                    + Quot<Self,Self> {\n    fn recip(&self) -> Self;\n}\n\npub trait Real: Signed\n              + Fractional {\n    // Common Constants\n    fn pi() -> Self;\n    fn two_pi() -> Self;\n    fn frac_pi_2() -> Self;\n    fn frac_pi_3() -> Self;\n    fn frac_pi_4() -> Self;\n    fn frac_pi_6() -> Self;\n    fn frac_pi_8() -> Self;\n    fn frac_1_pi() -> Self;\n    fn frac_2_pi() -> Self;\n    fn frac_2_sqrtpi() -> Self;\n    fn sqrt2() -> Self;\n    fn frac_1_sqrt2() -> Self;\n    fn e() -> Self;\n    fn log2_e() -> Self;\n    fn log10_e() -> Self;\n    fn log_2() -> Self;\n    fn log_10() -> Self;\n\n    // Exponential functions\n    fn pow(&self, n: Self) -> Self;\n    fn exp(&self) -> Self;\n    fn exp2(&self) -> Self;\n    fn expm1(&self) -> Self;\n    fn ldexp(&self, n: int) -> Self;\n    fn log(&self) -> Self;\n    fn log2(&self) -> Self;\n    fn log10(&self) -> Self;\n    fn log_radix(&self) -> Self;\n    fn ilog_radix(&self) -> int;\n    fn sqrt(&self) -> Self;\n    fn rsqrt(&self) -> Self;\n    fn cbrt(&self) -> Self;\n\n    // Angular conversions\n    fn to_degrees(&self) -> Self;\n    fn to_radians(&self) -> Self;\n\n    // Triganomic functions\n    fn hypot(&self, other: Self) -> Self;\n    fn sin(&self) -> Self;\n    fn cos(&self) -> Self;\n    fn tan(&self) -> Self;\n\n    // Inverse triganomic functions\n    fn asin(&self) -> Self;\n    fn acos(&self) -> Self;\n    fn atan(&self) -> Self;\n    fn atan2(&self, other: Self) -> Self;\n\n    // Hyperbolic triganomic functions\n    fn sinh(&self) -> Self;\n    fn cosh(&self) -> Self;\n    fn tanh(&self) -> Self;\n}\n\n/// Methods that are harder to implement and not commonly used.\npub trait RealExt: Real {\n    // Gamma functions\n    fn lgamma(&self) -> (int, Self);\n    fn tgamma(&self) -> Self;\n\n    // Bessel functions\n    fn j0(&self) -> Self;\n    fn j1(&self) -> Self;\n    fn jn(&self, n: int) -> Self;\n    fn y0(&self) -> Self;\n    fn y1(&self) -> Self;\n    fn yn(&self, n: int) -> Self;\n} \n```\n\nThe constants in `Real` could be [associated items](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/04/03/associated-items-continued/) in the future (see issue #5527). At the moment I have left the constants in `{float|f32|f64}::consts` in case folks need to access these at compile time. There are also instances of `int` in `Real` and `RealExt`. In the future these could be replaced with an associated `INTEGER` type on `Real`.\n\n`Natural` has also been renamed to `Integer`. This is because `Natural` normally means 'positive integer' in mathematics. It is therefore strange to implement it on signed integer types. `Integer` is probably a better choice.\n\nI have also switched some of the `Integer` methods to take borrowed pointers as arguments. This brings them in line with the `Quot` and `Rem` traits, and is be better for large Integer types like `BigInt` and `BigUint` because they don't need to be copied unnecessarily.\n\nThere has also been considerable discussion on the mailing list and IRC about the renaming of the `Div` and `Modulo` traits to `Quot` and `Rem`. Depending on the outcome of these discussions they might be renamed again.\n",
