    "body": "Hmm, I have mixed reactions. I admire your attempt to find something categorically _better_ than `init`/`tail`, and this may be in the right direction. _And_ I really quite strongly dislike the name `init`, so I'm inclined to like anything that changes that (`prefix`, anybody?). _But_ I do have some concerns:\n1. The names `pop_first` and `pop_last` seem misleading in that they do not mutate the underlying data. I'd prefer a name like `split`, though `split` currently returns two slices. Perhaps `split_front_elem` or `divide` or something like that.\n2. The change to return a tuple is nice when it works, but `slice.pop_last().unwrap().1` is quite a mouthful (as compared to `slice.init()`). On the other hand, it's probably mostly the `unwrap`, which is the whole point of this PR.\n3. Note that we made a deliberate decision to have many slice methods continue to panic on invalid indices precisely because when we attempted to convert them all to return `Option`, it seemed by and large to just make code messier. \n\n(Also, in collections, we tend to use the names \"front\" and \"back\", so maybe we should stick to that, rather than \"first/last\". Or does that seem specific to `LinkedList`?)\n\ncc @alexcrichton @aturon \n",
