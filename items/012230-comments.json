    "body": "I rebased the PR to create adapter structs.\n\nHowever, I'm not a big fan of this solution, at least not as the basis for a more general pattern in Rust programming. When creating a decorator, I think it makes the most sense that the decorator takes the value to decorate by value. Decorators that do this have the nice property of being Send if the value that they are wrapping is also Send. Decorators that take the value to wrap by reference, however, I believe, are never Send which may be a bit limiting to their use cases. So, as the author of a decorator, I'd prefer to enable the widest possible use cases, so, I want to take the thing to wrap by value. As the user of a decorator, I'd like to be able to decide if I want the decorator to take ownership of the value that I want to wrap or if I want it to take ownership of a reference to it - thus giving me the most flexibility. Creating the adapter structs does solve these problems. However, I think it has some drawbacks:\n- Its a fair amount of boilerplate. As a library author, I have to create a new struct and then add a method to my trait to instantiate that struct. And the method that needs to be added isn't really related to what my trait does, its more related to how someone might use that trait. So, the method feels a little bit out of place. One potential issue is that different library authors might end up implementing this in slightly different ways - by_ref(), byref(), RefThing::new(), etc which isn't great for consistency. The 2nd issue is that many library authors might just decide to wrap reference types exclusively - this works for many common cases and is less code, but it limits utility by making the instances non-Send.\n- The syntax feels a bit weird. If I want to create a reference to something, I do: `let x = &y`. However, I can't pass `x` to a generic method that expects a type that implements one of y's traits. If I want to do that, I need to do: `let x = y.by_ref()`. This feels like 2nd-class syntax for doing semantically the same thing as the first. I could be wrong, but, I believe its only possible to implement `by_ref()` in cases where all trait method take self by reference - ie, the same set where Rust could just derive it for us and produce an error if that wasn't possible. This feels like bit of a wart for newcomers and it also feels like it will be fairly difficult to write up a set of simple guidelines for when a library author should create a `by_ref()` method.\n\nSo, my opinion is that this PR provides a feature that I think could be useful in the short term (its useful for me), however, it doesn't feel like a great long term solution. Having Rust derive the relevant impls automatically feels more natural.\n\nI've tried taking a look into what would be required to have Rust derive those impls automatically, but, I don't really know where to start. If someone can point me in the right direction, and if it something that's not too intensely difficult, I'd be happy to take a stab at it.\n",

Some thoughts I have are:\n- I agree that this is some boilerplate, but it doesn't seem much more unreasonable than the boilerplate of `impl<'a, T: Reader> Reader for &'a mut T { ... }`.\n- I don't think we have to worry about construction forms once the standard library has settled on one. It's the same worry for creating iterators, do you call it `.each()`, `.iter()`, or `.iterator()`? It seems that community conventions normally win-out and guide design.\n- I think you're right in that the compiler can only automatically derive this with traits that have all methods as `&mut` and `&`. I also would find it very odd for the compiler to automatically derive traits in just this specific use case.\n",

    "body": "It's more unreasonable, since it introduces a redundant type and a redundant method.\n\nRegarding automatic derivation, one could always add a #[deriving] variant.\n\nSomething to think about is whether it might make sense to forbid having traits with multiple forms of self parameters: this way, all traits would use a single form of self, and of course the by-value self version would inherit the &mut version, which would inherit the & version (and yes, it would also be illegal to inherit from traits with \"stronger\" self parameter methods).\n\nAutomatic derivation would then no longer have the discontinuity that traits suddenly stop being derived when you add a by-value self method to a trait made only of &self and &mut self, because adding such a method would be an error.\n\nAn equivalent alternative is to automatically construct the subtraits, so that for instance Trait[&] would refer to the methods in trait that take &self, Trait[&mut] to the & and &mut self methods, etc. (this adds more syntax but reduces redundancy).\n\nAn even more radical approach is to remove all forms of self parameter except by-value, and support the other forms by implementing the trait on &Struct, &mut Struct, ~Struct, etc.; however, this would probably be harder to learn and adds complexity in trait bounds (since you need to express \"T such that &T implements Trait\"), so I think it's a worse choice.\n",

    "body": "@bill-myers I really like the Trait[&], Trait[&mut] idea. It feels like it solves the problem at hand while also being minimally impactful to the language as a whole. It would be nice if Trait[&] were the default and it required extra syntax to use the version of the trait that included the by-value self methods, but that would be more impactful to existing code. Maybe it would be best to open another ticket to explore that idea (or one of your other ideas) more fully?\n\n@alexcrichton Regarding this implementation vs introducing a new impl, I agree that its roughly the same cost regarding boilerplate. I liked the idea of having Rust automatically create the impl, but after thinking about it some more, I think I'm starting to see why that's probably not a great idea. So, if this looks good to you and it looks like a good addition to Rust, please pull this.\n\nThanks everyone for the reviews and comments!\n",

    "body": "Short of changing the language, it's possible to create a generic `ByRef` traits in rust as it currently stands.  Their usage isn't all that friendly, but I think it's at least interesting and relevant to the discussion here.\n\nThe generic ByRef looks like this:\n\n``` rust\nmod by_ref {\n    pub trait ByRef<T> {\n        fn get_ref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a T;\n    }\n\n    // If we had a \"Deref\" kind, then rather than having to separately\n    // impl for each pointer type, then we might have something like this:\n    // impl<'b,T,U:Deref<T>> ByRef<T> for U {\n    //     fn by_ref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a T { &**self }\n    // }\n    impl<'b,T> ByRef<T> for &'b T {\n        fn get_ref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a T { &**self }\n    }\n    impl<T> ByRef<T> for ~T {\n        fn get_ref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a T { &**self }\n    }\n\n    // We can't make bare objects all implement this--so we have to wrap it:\n    pub fn by_val<T>(t:T) -> ByRefBare<T> { ByRefBare(t) }\n    struct ByRefBare<T>(T);\n    impl<T> ByRef<T> for ByRefBare<T> {\n        fn get_ref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a T { match self { &ByRefBare(ref x) => x } }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis gives you a `ByRef<T>` that is implemented by pointers to T (borrowed and otherwise) as well as a wrapper around T itself that hopefully optimizes out.\n\nLet's see how it's used--say we have this trait, and want to make a decorator for it:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo {\n    fn foo(&self);\n}\n```\n\nLet's further assume that both `Foo` and the `by_ref` module come other crates, and so we can't add `impl<T:Foo> Foo for &T` or `impl<T:Foo> Foo for ByRef<T>`.  We can still write a decorator that takes either a value or a reference, without having to create trait-specific wrapper types such as `RefFoo`:\n\n``` rust\nstruct FooDecorator<R> {\n    inner:R\n}\nimpl<T:Foo,R:ByRef<T>> Foo for FooDecorator<R> {\n  fn foo(&self) {\n    /* do something... */\n    inner.get_ref().foo();\n    /* and do something else... */\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis isn't pretty, and unfortunately it uglifies the usage, not just the declaration: while you can call `FooDecorator::new` directly on a borrowed pointer or owned box, if you want to decorate an object by value you have to use `FooDecorator::new(by_val(my_value))` rather than `FooDecorator::new(my_value)`.  Bleh.  In exchange for this, you get to write the decorator without altering the decorated type, and without having to repeat all of the decorated type's methods a second time (as you have to to create a trait-specific wrapper like `RefReader`.)\n\nYou could also create a `ByMutRef` which would basically look the same as `ByRef` with a few `mut`s in the right places.\n\nFor my tastes, the fact that you have to be aware of this mechanism when _using_ the decorator, rather than just when writing it, make it seem like it's not worth it.  I couldn't come up with a way to eliminate that--there's no way to tell the compiler that any bare T automatically implements ByRef<T>.  (You can write `impl<T> ByRef<T> for T`, but that can't coexist with the definitions for `&T` and `~T`, and without those there's no point.)  But if that problem could be solved, it might be worth considering whether something similar to this would be good to have in std and used, rather than having to write these kinds of wrappers for trait after trait.\n",
