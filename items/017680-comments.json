    "body": "This isn't necessarily a local problem with just macros, no matter what order we place item definitions and documentation, there are pathological cases where both systems are difficult to understand. Right now \"definition first then documentation\" is consistent with the rest of the style that rustdoc uses. Additionally, `bitflags!` is a bit of an outlier in that most macros are not as large.\n\nThat being said, the navigability of rustdoc I think could always use some improvements, but I'm worried that this is locally optimizing for one outlier.\n",
