  "body": "This somewhat simplifies the parser and, more importantly, makes it easy for the pretty-printer to fetch precedences.\n\nThe handling of the table is ugly, as Rust doesn't allow non-primitive consts, and the immutable thing has to be passed around.\n\nTests seem to pass, but valgrind always complains on my system, and I'm not completely sure how to interpret the output.\n",
