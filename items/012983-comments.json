    "body": "Could you put wording such as this in both the commit message and as a comment in the test?\n\n> It appears that the `--as-needed` flag to linkers will not pull in a dynamic library unless it satisfies a _non weak_ undefined symbol. The `linkage1` test was creating a dynamic library where it was only used for a weak-symbol as part of an executable, so the dynamic library was getting discarded.\n> \n> This commit adds another symbol to the library which satisfies a strong undefined symbol, so the library is pulled in to resolve the weak reference\n",
