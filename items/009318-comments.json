    "body": "This looks pretty good from a libuv-bindings perspective, but currently there is no safe method to use this. Right now you could register a handler, and then forget to unregister it, causing possible leaks or use-after-free situations.\n\nI'm not entirely certain about the semantics of our `&fn` vs `~fn` types, but it seems like perhaps there should be some safe bindings which have a destructor which un-registers the handler. Something along the lines of:\n\n```\nlet handler = io::signal::Handler::new(SIGINT, || {\n  println(\"look, I got a sigint!\");\n});\nhandler.install();\n// handler is un-registered when it is destroyed.\n```\n\nBasically the main takeaway is that the main purpose of `rt::io` is to provide _safe_ bindings to all the `libuv` functions. That's the main bulk of what still needs to be done for this pull.\n",

    "body": "Signal handling is historically an incredibly tricky thing to get right. I would imaging that a lot of \"the magic\" is taken care for us by libuv, however.\n\nIt would be nice to have very explicit documentation about the exact behavior of the signal handling in order to clarify what exactly it means to receive a signal. Right now there's a few things in this pull I think are missing. Some of them may just require clarification, but they should all be thought about and considered.\n- What happens if two handlers are registered for the same signal?\n- There should certainly be tests.\n- What happens if a signal is received and no one is listening?\n- What happens if signals are received when previous ones have not been processed?\n\nThose are the ones that I can think of off the top of my head, and I think that others would be alleviated with some more extensive documentation about the signal handling.\n",

    "body": "I was looking into libuv's implementation, and they appear to handle most of my concerns, so I'm not too worried about the semantics of signal handling. It looks like everything here is essentially \"what we'd want to do\" in the sense that it's all the right plumbing. The more concerning part to me is that the libuv types and implementation are exposed directly to `rt::io`. This needs to be reorganized to follow the same layout as the rest of the implementations of I/O in `rt::io`. \n\nThat would involve making an `Rtio` type inside of `rt::rtio` and then adding a method to `IoFactory`. Inside of `rt::uv::uvio` you would then implement the `Rtio` type for some `Uv` type (which does much of this internally), and then everything is wrapped up and exposed through `rt::io::signal` in a wrapper which uses the `IoFactory` to create an object. Also, the return value of `Listener::new` should be `Option<Listener>` because there may be no local `IoFactory`.\n\nI can touch up the documentation afterwards, I'm mostly concerned about the organization right now. Again, sorry this took awhile to get to, but now I feel like I'm up to speed with the runtime and feel comfortable doing an actual review :)\n",
