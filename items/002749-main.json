  "body": "Prior to this commit, every block comment /\\* */ required two closing tags for\nevery opening tag in order to terminate the highlighting. Setting and testing\nfor a variable was the culprit, though I'm not certain why, but they appear to\njust be boilerplate lines from whatever pcwalton based this file upon. I've\nlooked at other officially-distributed vim highlighting files and none seem to\ndo the test that this commit removes, so I'm fairly certain it didn't provide\nanything vital. And now comment highlighting works!\n",
