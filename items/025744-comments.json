The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

I definitely don't consider it a part of the contract of `Eq`, however, that the implementation does not panic (this isn't mentioned at all in the documentation for one), so in that sense I think that this is fine. I feel that this is such a core primitive type that we need to make it as ergonomic as possible to use, which entails implementing all of these core traits (including those that may panic).\n\ncc @rust-lang/libs, do others have a strong opinion one way or another about this?\n",
