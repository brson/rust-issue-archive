Without either piece of information, it is impossible to know whether this `IntoFuture` implementation will wait for both Futures to complete before completing itself, or have them race (except maybe that racing would be implemented for `Future` rather than `IntoFuture`, but that's far from obvious).\r\n\r\nAbout the extra output potentially cluttering the doc page: What about having the extra information hidden by default, with one of those `[+]` expanders that we have all over rustdoc pages already?",
