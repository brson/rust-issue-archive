Rust's doc comments not only have semantic rules coupling them to code objects, but their contents are even _compiled_ in some cases. What's more, their usefulness is not, like a traditional comment, found in marking up code as you look at it -- they are instead a wholly separate product, existing mostly so that you _don't_ have to look at the code.\n\nThey are, in short, an entirely different thing than the comments denoted by that ubiquitous C syntax, and should not be shackled to that syntax or terminology simply because their Javadoc forebears are.\n\nAs for the immediate issue, I think @bjeanes's solution is elegant.\n",

Now we're discussing a design with more kinds of doc comments and more ambiguity, which could lead to\n- poorer docs, in the case of a doc comment that should have been a normal comment now being implicitly appended to the docs above it\n- poorer error messages, since if a doc comment could have documenting an item before _or_ after it, it's more complex to tell the user where we expected an item\n- and more error messages, since we can't use both styles\n\ndepending, of course, on the chosen design.\n\nI am strongly against adding another kind of documentation comment; it will buy us very little (choosing the position of the documentation in source code) and complicate the involved tooling needlessly.\n",

    "body": ":+1:\n\nI like forcing documentation comments to be on their own line to eliminate ambiguity. Right now end-of-line ones are unintuitive: they cause an error or, worse, describe the wrong item. I think we should either get rid of them or fix them. \n\nIn the short term, we can just write a better error message (as @adambadawy suggested) and force documentation comments to be on their own line. It would avoid a lot of complexity. But it would be nice to ultimately allow end-of-line documentation comments. Sometimes it's more convenient to describe something on the same line. Plus it's intuitive; people will probably attempt to do it anyway. \n\nI like @vitoreiji's suggestion if we decide to keep end-of-line documentation comments:\n1. Documentation comments on their own line describe what appears on the next line.\n2. Documentation comments that share a line with anything else describe that content.\n3. It's illegal to describe something by using both forms.\n\nIn the error message, complain that multiple documentation comments describe the content and suggest that one of them should become a normal comment.\n\nIt's another error message, but it's one that people will rarely encounter if ever. Is there any reason one would want to use both forms at once?\n\nExamples:\n\nOK:\n\n```\nenum Option<T> {\n    /// Describes Some(T)\n    Some(T),\n    None,\n}\n```\n\nOK:\n\n```\nenum Option<T> {\n    Some(T), /// Describes Some(T)\n    None,\n}\n```\n\nBad:\n\n```\nenum Option<T> {\n    /// Describes Some(T)\n    Some(T), /// Also attempts to describe Some(T)\n    None,\n}\n```\n\nThe only downside I can think of is it would silently break comments that rely on the weird existing behavior. \n\nIf we force them to stand alone first, then they would break loudly. Then, once everyone has fixed those errors and moved the comments to their own lines, we could add the proper end of line comments. This way, nothing would quietly break. \n",

    "body": "I have actually read this issue twice before and it *still* took me around 10 minutes to figure out why I was getting this error. Specifically I had this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct Foo {\r\n};\r\n\r\nimpl Foo {\r\n\r\n    /// bar does something\r\n    fn bar(&self) {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// baz does another thing\r\n    /* fn baz(&self) {\r\n        // ...\r\n    } */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, normal code but I had commented out one function. It gives this error:\r\n\r\n    error: expected one of `const`, `default`, `extern`, `fn`, `pub`, `type`, or `unsafe`, found `}`\r\n\r\nThis is *really* confusing. Would it really be that hard to have the error say something like this?\r\n\r\n    error: expected documentable item (one of `const`, `default`, `extern`, `fn`, `pub`, `type`, or `unsafe`) after documentation comment, found `}`\r\n\r\nAnd then point to the `///` comment that triggered it. This would be a huge improvement and I guarantee it will save many people a lot of time. And Happy Christmas!\r\n\r\nEdit/PS: Obviously in this example code it is vaguely clear what the cause is... ish. But of course my *real* code is significantly more complex and it was extremely far from obvious what was causing the problem. Especially as one does not normally consider comments as affecting whether compilation succeeds or not. In fact I might go so far as to say compilation *should* still succeed in this case. I.e. it should be a warning.",

This is with Rust 1.17.\r\n\r\nAlso, it was suggested a couple of times above to allow documentation following the item it's documenting. I think that is a bad idea because it doesn't _scale_ very well. Basically, you quickly end up with very long lines. Go uses that system for the so-called struct tags and in my experience, it's been awkward to use.\r\n\r\nVertical space is cheaper than horizontal space, so I think it's good if Rust at least makes that the default way to format things.",
