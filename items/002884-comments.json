    "body": "In this patch rust's rt::fail is still a wrapper around C, so you will still be able to break on the C upcall_fail if you want. In the future, the plan is to get rid of upcall_fail (and the entire upcall stack switching path), so you'll have to break on rt::fail just like you'd break on any other rust function. I believe that should still work fine, as long as you have debugging symbols.\n",
