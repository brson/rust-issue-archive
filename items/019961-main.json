  "body": "This commit, like the second pass of `Option`, largely just stablizes the\nexisting functionality after renaming a few iterators.\n\nThe specific actions taken were:\n- The `Ok` and `Err` variants were marked `#[stable]` as the stability\n  inheritance was since removed.\n- The `as_mut` method is now stable.\n- The `map` method is now stable\n- The `map_err` method is now stable\n- The `iter`, `iter_mut`, and `into_iter` methods now returned structures named\n  after the method of iteration. The methods are also now all stable.\n- The `and_then` method is now stable.\n- The `or_else` method is now stable.\n- The `unwrap` family of functions are now all stable: `unwrap_or`,\n  `unwrap_or_else`, `unwrap`, and `unwrap_err`.\n\nThere is a possible open extension to `Result::{and, and_then}` to make the\nreturn type further generic over `FromError` (as proposed in #19078), but this\nis a backwards compatible change due to the usage of default type parameters,\nwhich makes the two functions safe to stabilize now regardless of the outcome of\nthat issue.\n",
