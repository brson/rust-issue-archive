  "body": "This PR is changing the error messages for non-exhaustive pattern matching to include a more accurate witness, i.e. a pattern that is not covered by any of the ones provided by the user. Example:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    match (true, (Some(\"foo\"), [true, true]), Some(42u)) {\n        (false, _, _) => (),\n        (true, (None, [true, _]), None) => (),\n        (true, (None, [false, _]), Some(1u)) => ()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n``` sh\n/tmp/witness.rs:2:2: 6:3 error: non-exhaustive patterns: (true, (core::option::Some(_), _), _) not covered\n/tmp/witness.rs:2   match (true, (Some(\"foo\"), [true, true]), Some(42u)) {\n/tmp/witness.rs:3       (false, _, _) => (),\n/tmp/witness.rs:4       (true, (None, [true, _]), None) => (),\n/tmp/witness.rs:5       (true, (None, [false, _]), Some(1u)) => ()\n/tmp/witness.rs:6   }\n```\n\nAs part of that, I refactored some of the relevant code and carried over the changes to fixed vectors from the previous PR.\n\nI'm putting it out there for now but the tests will be red.\n",
