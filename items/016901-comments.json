    "body": "If this function is intended for users then implementing the dlopen logic would be helpful because, yes, changing LD_LIBRARY_PATH after program startup has no effect on Linux, and ditto DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Darwin.\n\nBut DynamicLibrary::prepend_search_path() would not be a good API because it's a global static function.  A more useful API would be a non-static struct, e.g. DynamicLibraryLoader, which can be instantiated in user code.\n\nThe benefit is that it would allow users to create instances with differing search paths.  An instance of a DynamicLibraryLoader could have an add_search_path() that actually works because it would implement the search-path logic itself.  I wouldn't call it nasty or error-prone; the logic is pretty simple.\n\nAt first I thought that DynamicLibrary::search_path() could be consulted when constructing a DynamicLibraryLoader's initial search path, breathing a little more life into DynamicLibrary's utility.  In that world the global prepend_to_search_path() would serve a useful purpose -- it can be used to setup the default search path that's present when creating new instances.  But, thinking it through, global state is bad, and coupling these two structs would also be a bad idea, so, yeah, prepend_search_path() is kind of a useless API and should probably be documented as having caveats on most non-Windows platforms.\n",
