A few dozen of those were from `with_cond` calls (fixed in an earlier PR), and a few hundred from from lazy binops. I don't know how representative that is or if it saves much in terms of compile time, but the places I looked at were rather hard to read due to the extra branches and basic blocks. The fact that some of them were inside matches didn't exactly help ;-)\n",
