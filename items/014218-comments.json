I think that something like this may need to go through the RFC process first so we can flesh out all the details.\n\nI don't think just using a `cfg` attribute will work because it assumes that we're going to use the same syntax for forever, which is likely not true (we may add new syntactical constructs), in which case `#[cfg]` may not be sufficient (but perhaps it could be made to be sufficient!).\n",
