    "body": "(and a random thought I had while reflecting on this: if we actually allocated extra NodeIds with each expr type that introduces dummy nodes (at least, I _believe_ there is a statically determinable upper bound on the number of dummy cfg nodes per expr node), then the relation between Expr Node ID and CFGIndex would be a simple offset calculation determined from the NodeId of the block itself.  That would save us the time of building up the map that is currently used to represent that relation explicitly.)\n\n---\n\nupdate: the above idea isn't ridiculous, but it also isn't an obvious win: You still have the problem that the NodeId's are sparse, i.e. that there may be large gaps between different NodeId's associated with the same control flow graph.\n",
