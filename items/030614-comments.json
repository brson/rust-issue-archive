    "body": "@nagisa aha! I do feel like an explicit error type is probably better.\n\nA `Cow` conversion would actually be quite nice too, but that one maybe belongs outside the standard library. `from_bytes -> Result<Cow<CStr>, usize>` seems like a little too much magic to me personally, but I wouldn't be entirely opposed to it. An additional method could work too, but I'd have no idea what to call it... `from_bytes_cow` is a terrible name.\n\nEDIT: On second thought, I can't imagine a case when you wouldn't know beforehand whether your byte slice is terminated or not, and we already have `CString::new` for that.\n",

    "body": "Well, I'd break it into...\n1. It's currently \"impossible\" to create a `&CStr` from a byte slice. You can use a transmute but that makes assumptions about the memory layout of the `CStr` type, which may change in the future to a thin pointer. So `from_bytes_unchecked` is pretty important to have as a basic building block.\n2. `from_bytes` is the safe checked version of the above. It's the borrowed version of `CString::new`, which I find to be useful.\n3. It's essentially a lifetime-safe version of `from_ptr`, so similar usecases apply. Mapping data inside another slice to a `&CStr` (for example when zero-copy parsing some binary formats) is a concrete one that's come up for me.\n4. It feels nicer than `CStr::from_ptr(b\"hello\\0\".as_ptr() as *const _)` for literals. Making it `const unsafe` would be really nice too, though I'm not sure if that's possible to implement in today's rust?\n",

    "body": "> It's currently \"impossible\" to create a &CStr from a byte slice\n\nThis is actually somewhat intentional, because the ideal representation of `&CStr` is just a pointer. The `CStr` type itself should continue to be unsized, but it's just an implementation detail that the only way to do that today is via `[u8]`. The intention was that `CStr` doesn't keep track of the length, and hence it architecturally is indeed impossible to go from `&[u8]` to `&CStr` in a \"lossless fashion\".\n\n---\n\nI do agree that literal construction is pretty difficult, but that's more along the lines of needs-to-be-a-compiler-plugin than anything else I think to ensure that the nul byte is always at the end. In theory the `from_ptr` function is a noop (and hence a `const` candidate), but due to the reasons mentioned above it needs to calculate the length and hence isn't a `const` candidate.\n",

    "body": "> This is actually somewhat intentional, because the ideal representation of &CStr is just a pointer. The CStr type itself should continue to be unsized, but it's just an implementation detail that the only way to do that today is via [u8].\n\nWhether the `&CStr` type encodes the length as part of its type or calculates it when necessary is an implementation detail though! That's exactly why it helps to have that method as a forward-compatible way of converting, since an unsafe transmute won't necessarily work in future Rust versions.\n\n> The intention was that CStr doesn't keep track of the length, and hence it architecturally is indeed impossible to go from &[u8] to &CStr in a \"lossless fashion\".\n\nMy view would be that as long as you can reconstruct the `&[u8]` from the `&CStr` (even if a length calculation is involved), the conversion can be considered to be lossless and the types can be considered semantically equivalent (plus the extra invariants guaranteed by the `&CStr` type).\n\n> I do agree that literal construction is pretty difficult, but that's more along the lines of needs-to-be-a-compiler-plugin than anything else I think to ensure that the nul byte is always at the end.\n\nWell, if we assume a rustc with a more useful const fn story, we could implement it as a macro like so:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! cstr {\n    ($s:expr) => {\n        unsafe { ::std::ffi::CStr::from_bytes_unchecked(concat!($s, \"\\0\").as_bytes()) }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe same could be implemented via `from_ptr` if we can get rid of the length calculation. It's true that's a discussion not really that related to this PR.\n\n---\n\nAnother thought is that we could make `from_ptr` not involve a length calculation today, and defer it to when it's needed (if someone calls `.len()`, `.as_bytes()` or similar). Simply use 0 length as a sentinel that means the length isn't known. Or `-1 as usize`. And if you feel super adventurous, update the length with a volatile store (on platforms where that's guaranteed to be atomic) once it's calculated upon a call of one of those methods to avoid the check in the future.\n\n---\n\nIt's true that `from_bytes_unchecked` would be unnecessary from a performance perspective if `from_ptr` didn't involve a length calculation, as they'll potentially be equivalent in the future. I still feel like the lifetime tie-in is a nice advantage that makes this a useful API in any case. The safe version that checks for interior and trailing null is mainly for convenience.\n\nAlso, another case where this API is useful is when creating C strings on the stack in a `[u8; MAXPATHLEN]`, both for the lifetime borrow checking metadata and length check bypass.\n",

Though I'd argue that `CStr` is a general purpose container of non-0 bytes **that ends in a terminating 0 byte** and that  `to_bytes` is the wrong default; `to_bytes()`/`to_inner_bytes()` would've made more sense IMO, but it's too late to argue that now.\n\n> I wonder if perhaps a better name would be `from_bytes_with_nul` instead of just `from_bytes`.
