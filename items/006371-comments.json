    "body": "This doesn't look to be an error, just an unfortunate stage0 thing. If you add `#[cfg(stage0)]`, the warning goes away. The reason for this is that the `#[deriving(IterBytes)]` attribute used to generated code of the form:\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(IterBytes)]\nenum A { B, }\n#[doc = \"Automatically derived.\"]\npub impl ::core::to_bytes::IterBytes for A {\n    pub fn iter_bytes(&self, __lsb0: bool, __f: core::to_bytes::Cb) {\n        match *self { B => { 0u.iter_bytes(__lsb0, __f); } }; }\n    }\n```\n\nwhereas now it spits out\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(IterBytes)]\nenum A { B, }\n#[doc = \"Automatically derived.\"]\npub impl ::core::to_bytes::IterBytes for A {\n    pub fn iter_bytes(&self, __arg_0: ::bool, __arg_1: ::core::to_bytes::Cb)\n     -> ::bool {\n        match *self { B => 0u.iter_bytes(__arg_0, __arg_1) }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhich if you notice on the second argument, the path was changed from a relative path to an absolute one, which would explain why in later stages the `use core` isn't needed, but in stage0 it is.\n",
