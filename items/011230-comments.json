We've had a number of copy-on-write proposals in the past, but this is certainly clean and well written.\n\nCode-wise, the only comment I have is that a `Freeze` bound is probably still needed to allow safe sharing of read-only data.\n\nContent-wise, I'm a little in favor of this, but others should weigh in as well. We're still planning on dissolving libextra at some point, but this might make a nice addition for the `arc` module regardless.\n",
