    "body": "This will need to add support for `foo(\"bar\")` and then switch it in a later commit once we get a snapshot. \n\nI'm a little surprised that `foo(\"bar\")` is the same as `foo(bar)` because what about `foo(\"something with spaces\")`? Our attribute language has a nice symmetry right now where everything inside of the parens is just a continuation of the same grammar for what's inside the brackets. We're starting to violate that symmetry by disallowing `foo = \"bar\"` at the root, and I think for now we're keeping `foo = \"bar\"` inside of parens, so it's already a little off.\n\nRegardless, though, I think that `foo(\"bar\")` should be an equivalent form of `foo = \"bar\"` in that it's a name/value pair, not an inner list of attributes.\n",
