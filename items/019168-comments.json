    "body": "This would theoretically be resolved by putting the whole script into a function that then gets executed at the very end, so nothing happens until that is reached, e.g.\n\n``` rust\nf() {\n    rm -Rf \"${TMP_DIR}\"\n    need_ok \"failed to remove temporary installation directory\"\n\n    mkdir -p \"${TMP_DIR}\"\n    need_ok \"failed to create create temporary installation directory\"\n\n    ...\n    rm -Rf \"${TMP_DIR}\"\n    need_ok \"couldn't rm temporary installation directory\"\n}\n\nf\n```\n\n(Tagging as E-easy due to this, I believe the file is available in `src/etc`.)\n",
