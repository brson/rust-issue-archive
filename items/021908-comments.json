    "body": "As mentioned on IRC, this has already been filed as #12782 and #12916, and in both cases the decision was that this has to go through the RFC process. I filed an RFC that covered this as rust-lang/rfcs#88, which has lots of discussion, and the ultimate decision was that this is a post-1.0 feature.\n\nIf you have any feedback on this, commenting on that RFC is probably the best bet, as that's likely to be the starting point for any further discussion of this post-1.0.\n",
