It's not actually recursive though.\n\nThe fact that it compiles and gives the expected result suggests that this isn't a bug.\n",

    "body": "Well, that particular testcase isn't fundamentally unsound by itself, I guess... it's just hard to write testcases here because const_eval is very limited at the moment.  Another testcase, which I just came up with:\n\n``` rust\ntrait A {\n    type T;\n}\nimpl A for [u8; 257] {\n    type T = u8;\n}\nimpl A for [u8; 1] {\n    type T = u16;\n}\ntype T = <[u8; C] as A>::T;\nconst C: usize = 257 as T as usize;\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nRust currently rejects this with `non-scalar cast: `i32` as `<[u8; 257] as A>::T``... but clearly there's an inconsistency somewhere.  I would argue that we should explicitly reject this because of the recursion.\n\nIf we ever support size_of or array indexing in const_eval, those will also lead to very awkward results.\n",
