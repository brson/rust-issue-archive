At runtime, this may require some extra copying in order to do the necessary check before the function returns. But that seems to reflect what the programmer's intuition would be. The other alternative would just be to make arguments immutable if they're mentioned in any postcondition constraints. I like the first option better, though.\n",

The postcondition wants to look more like (size > 0u -> is_not_empty(*)) -- however, the implication arrow doesn't exist in our constraint language now and adding it was add some complexity. Of course, you could also write an alloc_vec_nonempty function with a precondition on size.\n\nAnyway, I still want to implement this feature, just not sure when.\n",

The `is_not_zero(size)` constraint would appear in the user code in both examples (with or without post-conditions for return types), because the user initializes `xs` using an `uint` literal. If he decides to get `size` as a parameter, then his code will be check-free again:\n\n```\nfn f(size: uint): is_not_zero(size) -> int {\n    let xs = alloc_vec(10u);\n    ret vec::head(xs);\n}\n```\n\nAlso I'd like to note, that the typestate checking with function post-conditions will remain a local algorithm.\n",
