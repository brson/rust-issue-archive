    "body": "@z0w0 I think the correct thing to do (which rustpkg doesn't currently do, as per @bjz ) would be to install to the first entry in the RUST_PATH as long as there is a user-set RUST_PATH (that is, one that's from the environment and doesn't just have default entries in it).\n\nThe change that results in this behavior was intended (by me) to make sure that if you haven't set a RUST_PATH, and you install a package with your current working directory being a workspace, you install into the existing workspace and rustpkg doesn't confusingly create a new .rust directory for you. But I think the behavior when there is a set RUST_PATH should be what @bjz is suggesting.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n",
