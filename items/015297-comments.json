    "body": "Oddly enough, running the tests from `cmd` with a windows style path with backslashes and semi-colons seems to work fine, although it frequently pops up dialogs complaining about missing dlls. I'm now rebuilding rust entirely from `cmd` to see how things work.\n\nEDIT: A freshly rebuilt rust from `cmd` still has the same missing dll dialogs. I'm not exactly sure if thats bad or not since the tests continue on regardless and don't report any failures.\n",
