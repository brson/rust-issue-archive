    "body": "> It does, but it also has downsides as well. You can't do all the stuff you can do with a 'real' checkout.\n\nAt one point shallow clones were pretty broken compared to 'real' clones (you couldn't push/pull from/to shallow clones, for example), but the situation is much better as of git 2.0. See https://github.com/git/git/commit/82fba2b9d39163a0c9b7a3a2f35964cbc039e1a and https://blog.oio.de/2014/02/06/better-support-for-shallow-clones-in-git-1-9/\n\nOf course, with a shallow clone one's options for digging through history are limited. But for someone who just wants to build, that may not be a big deal. \n\nMy personal preference is to leave `--depth` out, though. Not everyone is on git 2.0 and the Rust README hardly seems like the right place for git education ;-)\n",
