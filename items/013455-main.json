  "body": "Rust advertises itself as being compatible with linux 2.6.18, but the timerfd\nset of syscalls weren't added until linux 2.6.25. There is no real need for a\nspecialized timer implementation beyond being a \"little more accurate\", but the\nselect() implementation will suffice for now.\n\nIf it is later deemed that an accurate timerfd implementation is needed, it can\nbe added then through some method which will allow the standard distribution to\ncontinue to be compatible with 2.6.18\n\nCloses #13447\n",
