    "body": "- `char::to_lowercase` does some flavor of Unicode case folding. It includes some fun cases like mapping the Kelvin sign \u212a to ASCII lower case k.\n- `str::to_ascii_lower` only maps ASCII letters and leaves everything else alone. Although it often looks wrong on arbitrary input, it can make sense when used on a closed set of strings that is entirely ASCII like CSS\u00a0property names.\n\nThe PR currently uses `char::to_lowercase`, so the `to_lower!` macro name is consistent.\n",
