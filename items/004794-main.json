  "body": "Want to get this on the radar and moving forward. I'm having build issues in mingw32, so I'll probably be troubleshooting from afar on that front.\n\nThis work mostly involves:\n- Updating the libuv submodule (which, in the scope of this pull req, is pointing at olsonjeffery/libuv, pending a merge into master from graydon (which is, itself, tricky)) with the last 9 months or so of changes from them (refcount refactor and numerous other codebase cleanups)\n- Retooling the build process a bit, doing away with a bunch of gnarly scripting and, for the most part, just using libuv's own Makefile, which is great\n- Minor updates to the API to account for the loss of `uv_refcount`, we now just do a check for any live handles during the weak task exit check in `iotask`, and barf if we encounter any lives tasks\n- Adjustment to the various libuv structs, whose size changed in the intervening time\n\nNote on the last bullet: I want to turn another another patch, soon, to change the mechanism of libuv struct mapping to be dynamic and based off of malloc'd data wrapped in a rust wrapper to alleviate the headache of maintaining these structs across multiple platforms, as the libuv API exports stuff designed specifically for this purpose. The usual weighing of benefits/tradeoffs ensues.\n",
