    "body": "It should be faster than the current rust rsqrt, but I would not be surprised if there is an x86 assembly instruction that does it faster.  However, if we assume that rust will be used on non x86 platforms (ie ARM) then using x86 specific code isn't really the optimal solution.  I could be totally wrong though, and if `rsqrtss` is platform independent then I would be all for just adopting that in the regular rsqrt function (because if it is exact then there is no reason to have a separate function for it).\nEdit: also, as pointed out by [@killmous](https://github.com/killmous) `rsqrtss` only works with x86 processors with the SSE chip (introduced in 1999).  Obviously that only excludes a small portion of users, but I'm sure there are some people with old hardware out there.\nAlso, according to your link, \"both the MSVC and GCC compilers default to exclusively using the x87 for scalar math, so unless you edit the 'code generation' project properties... you\u2019ll be stuck with code that uses the old slow way.\"\n",

    "body": "I'm against merging this in as it currently stands.\n\nGiven the massive performance increase of using `rsqrtss` over Carmack's algorithm, throwing it out because it 1) doesn't work on 15-year-old hardware and 2) only works on x86 is silly. We have conditional compilation to manage the cpu platform differences and using something like CPUID to check for SSE seems like a faster option, even with the branch. Or are you planning on supporting the  21-year old computer market as well? It seems like adding a second function for performance reasons, then ignoring an order-of-magnitude faster possibility defeats the point.\n\nThis shouldn't be part of the `Float` trait. The very concept of a fast rsqrt function suggests that it isn't widely applicable and indeed doesn't make a lick of sense for a hypothetical arbitrary precision floating point type.\n\nThe implementation of `fast_rsqrt` for `f64` is unacceptable. Loosing half the precision is not a valid solution. Either it shouldn't be available at all or should be implemented in a way that doesn't produce such a massive amount of error. A brief search finds that the double-precision version is identical except for using `i64` and `0x5fe6eb50c7b537a9` as the magic number. \n\nThere are no benchmarks. Irrelevant of platform capabilities, anything that touts performance _needs_ benchmarks.\n",
