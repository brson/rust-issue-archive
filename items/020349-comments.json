    "body": "It's historical, extracted from the rustc `back` module which was itself always misnamed. It's always been a dumping ground.\n\nI don't recall why we started resolving symlinks in parts of the compiler. Perhaps @alexcrichton does.\n\nWhen those utility functions are dumped in rustc its usually because they weren't good enough quality for std, or because somebody failed to win that argument, or just didn't want to make the effort of pursuing it.\n\nRefactoring in the compiler is always well received.\n",
