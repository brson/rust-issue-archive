  "body": "As we start to move runtime components into the crate map, it's becoming harder\nand harder to start the runtime from a C function as rust is embedded in another\napplication. Right now if you compile a rust crate as a dynamic library which is\nthen linked to another application, when using std::rt::start there are no I/O\nlocal services, even though rustuv was linked against and requested. The reason\nfor this is that there is no top level crate map available specifying where to\nfind libuv I/O.\n\nThis option is not meant to be used regularly, but rather whenever compiling a\nfinal library crate and linking it into another application. This lifts the\nrequirement that to get a crate map you must have the final destination be an\nexecutable.\n",
