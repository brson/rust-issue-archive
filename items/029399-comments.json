The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

This is indeed a backwards-incompatible change, and @huonw pointed out that we could do something like implement `AsMut` for `RefCell` but we're not able to implement `AsRef` (a use case for having one and not the other). In general these conversion traits are meant to be as lightweight as possible, reinforcing the decision to not tie them to one another.\n",
