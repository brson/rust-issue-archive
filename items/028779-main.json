  "body": "This lint warning was originally intended to help against misuse of the old Rust\n`int` and `uint` types in FFI bindings where the Rust `int` was not equal to the\nC `int`. This confusion no longer exists (as Rust's types are now `isize` and\n`usize`), and as a result the need for this lint has become much less over time.\n\nAdditionally, starting with [the RFC for libc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1291) it's likely that `isize` and\n`usize` will be quite common in FFI bindings (e.g. they're the definition of\n`size_t` and `ssize_t` on many platforms).\n\nThis commit disables these lints to instead consider `isize` and `usize` valid\ntypes to have in FFI signatures.\n",
