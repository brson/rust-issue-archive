    "body": "Update:\n\nI worked on fixing this: it occurs at 2 levels, the Rust level and the LLVM level. I believe I fixed the Rust level with 3f5b50fd9b6ad505319f85fe5b056a0d05073c0b. \n\nHowever, LLVM relies on autotools, and line 1713 (AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS) of LLVM's configure.ac appears to generate a block which was resistant to my fixing; it kept producing ${llvm_src}/and/a/path in configure, where $llvm_src would have paths in it. Someone who understands autotools will have to make that work. Note that except for that block, I think I fixed the configure.ac - but I haven't pushed those changes yet since it doesn't work.\n",
