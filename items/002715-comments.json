    "body": "Yeah Alexandrescu's range iterators are cool. He gave a good talk on them at Boostcon a few years ago: http://blip.tv/boostcon/boostcon-2009-keynote-2452140\n\nI expect they were influential in the design of iterators in D. I played around with implementing them in C++. I'm not sure if Rust will have the heavy metaprogramming capability that makes them compile-time optimizeable, but that may be true of all types of iterators and generic operations. But they are very powerful and worth looking into.\n",
