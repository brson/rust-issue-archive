(Though if the spec implies doing it in string constants, then that is probably just sloppiness in the writing of the spec.)\n\nRelated bug: #2253\n\nupdate: To clarify, graydon originally wanted to do NFKC normalization in the lexer (as noted in the bug above), but he changed his mind and so we have been in a bit of a state of limbo ever since.  But as I said above, the scope of that normalization was, I think, intended to be restricted to identifiers, not all lexical syntax (i.e. not the interior of string constants).  \n",
