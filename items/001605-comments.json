    "body": "I have tracked down the cause for this and have a fix that I didn't push yet due to the release.  It's actually the test that is at fault. The problem occurs when using 32 bit integers.  The length of the string to be md4ified is stored in a uint and then encoded as part of the data.  But it's expected to be 64-bits long (potentially).  There is a loop that right shifts, encoding each byte into the data.  But the result of a shift that is wider than the value being shifted (e.g., a u32 being shifted by 32 bits) is undefined in C and in LLVM (and hence in Rust, at least as currently implemented).  This leads to weird results.  For some reason, when optimizations are turned on the expected result (8 >> 32 == 0) is produced.  But with optimizations off you get other values.\n",
