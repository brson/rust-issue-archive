    "body": "So, I've been investigating different options of reducing space usage for spans but I've not been really successful.\n- At the moment it's not possible to omit some spans from metadata but not others. The reason is that spans occur in the AST and we use `derive`-generated `Encode/Decode` implementations for these data structures. If we had a `#[dont_serialize_me]` attributes for fields, we could do something here. However, I didn't want to add this feature in a rudimentary, ad-hoc fashion, just for this one use case.\n- I made the compiler store spans in the variable-sized LEB128 format also used in DWARF. This however didn't give the expected space reduction because our RBML writer is super-wasteful, tagging each `u8` I emit with a type-tag and a byte storing the size of the number. This results in at least 3 bytes and up to 12 bytes per `BytePos` and between 6 and 24 bytes per `Span` which totally defeats the purpose of storing things in LEB128.\n\nA maybe acceptable intermediate solution is to store spans as one `u64` in order to cut down on RBML tagging overhead. In a preliminary test this worked quite well under the circumstances. I'll push a cleaned up version of this the day after tomorrow.\n\nThe real problem though is how metadata is encoded in general (an issue already recorded in #21482). It's super-verbose and I doubt that all this tagging really has much of a benefit. Coming up with a better data format will be necessary sooner or later.\n",
