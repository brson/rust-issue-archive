    "body": "@cmr I'm interested in having a lint that enforces that a given enum (marked with an attribute) always benefits from the null pointer optimization. And by that I mean it's an enum that takes a type parameter and I want to flag any uses of the enum that result in a concrete type that's not null-pointer-optimized. I would then add this attribute to `libc::Nullable`, and promote that type as the right type to use for nullable functions in `extern` blocks. We're currently recommending using `Option`, but this use only works if we can guarantee that it's null-pointer-optimized, and right now we make no such guarantee.\n\nMore specifically, I'd want to ensure that it maps to `RawNullablePointer` (as opposed to `StructWrappedNullablePointer`), although that part shouldn't really be in question (as it's a function of the number of fields of the non-nullary variant), but it is part of the guarantee we need to make for correct FFI.\n\nNote that this lint also requires knowing which enums to consider. Implementing this on top of your current hacky work (assuming `node_levels` instead of `enum_levels`) could be done by only recording the level in the map if the enum is marked with the attribute, and otherwise ignoring it. That way trans would consider any non-annotated enums to be `Allow` even though the enum itself would default to either warn or error.\n",
