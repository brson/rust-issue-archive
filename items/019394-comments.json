    "body": "I think it's tough, or maybe intractable, for rustdoc in its current form to do this the \"right way\". As best as I can tell, if rustdoc would need to take every trait implementation which has a type parameter (`impl Trait for Vec<T> where T: SomeOtherTrait` is similar to a blanket implementation), and walk all documented types to check which ones fall under the impl. It gets worse when you consider generic types like `Vec<T>` (`Vec<i32>` might fall under a blanket impl, but not `Vec<u32>`, for example).\n\nA workable solution might be some kind of rustdoc-specific attribute that indicates an impl is a \"blanket impl\", with a (Rust) path indicating where the docs for that trait's methods should be inlined. That way at least the common extension traits in the standard library would be documented on the types they extend.\n\nSomething like:\n\n``` rust\n// Not totally relevant since `IteratorExt` is gone now, but...\n\npub trait Iterator { /* ... */ }\npub trait IteratorExt { /* ... */ }\n\n// vvv problematic if this path is re-exported eventually\n#[rustdoc_blanket_impl(\"$crate::iter::Iterator\")]\nimpl IteratorExt for T where T: Iterator {\n    /* ... */\n}\n```\n",

I also agree with @Manishearth that this is all working as intended today.\n\nWe don't have too too many more blanket impls in the standard library beyond conversion traits, so I don't think the need for this is so great any more. I'm going to close this for now due to it working as intended, and we can reopen in the future if the need is great enough with a specialized attribute like @tomjakubowski showed perhaps.\n",
