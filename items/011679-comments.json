    "body": "I have found that after trying to run the command it generates the `.rust` folder.\n\nWithin the `.rust` folder I have this path `.rust/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/github.com/trevorriles/` and that directory is empty.\n\nThen if I create my repo directory in that folder using \n`mkdir .rust/build/x86-64-unknown-linux-gnu/github.com/trevorriles/hello` \nI can now run \n`rustpkg install github.com/trevorriles/hello` \nand it works without issue.\n\nFigured I would share this as it might help the developers figure out what the root problem is here.\n",
