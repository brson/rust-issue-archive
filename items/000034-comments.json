    "body": "See https://github.com/graydon/rust/wiki/Constrained-types for our current thinking on this (mistakes are solely due to me). A problem with inserting checks for explicit casts is that it still requires further type system restrictions. Like, suppose you wrote:\n\n```\nlet p = (a, b) as ordered_pair;\nlet q : ordered_pair = p;\nq = (2, 1);\n```\n\nThis is a bad program, because (2, 1) is not of type `ordered_pair`. But it's not clear how to design the typechecker and typestate so as to reject it. One simple solution is just to disallow `ordered_pair` as a type on the LHS of a declaration. \n\nSo since we have to introduce this restriction anyway, it seems to make sense to limit the introduction forms for things that have constrained types -- that is, the only place where the name of a constrained type can appear in a declaration is a function signature. \n\nThis is still very much of an open question, so I'm open to debate. I haven't had breakfast yet, so let me know if any of this doesn't make sense ;-)\n",
