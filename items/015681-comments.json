    "body": "There are actually two lints in play here, the `unused_result` and `unused_must_use` lint. The latter is turned on by default, whereas the former is not turned on by default.\n\nThe `unused_result` lint is much broader than the `unused_must_use` lint where it applies to any type, not just those marked with `#[must_use]`. In this example you're opting-in to the more strict semantics instead of relying on just `unused_must_use`. \n\nJust the must-use lint will not warn about this program, so I'm going to close this as working as intended.\n",
