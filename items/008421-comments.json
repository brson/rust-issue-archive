    "body": "I found out that llvm won't optimize this unless the constant _also_ has an internal-type linkage. Thatmeans that statics marked `pub` won't benefit from this.\n\nAdditionally though, TLS keys all have significant addresses, and in my opinion it would be a real bummer to have to mark all of our tls keys with `address_significant`. An awesome solution to that possibly would be exportable macros from tls (and the macro throws on `address_significant`).\n\nFor now I think that normal statics shouldn't have this thrown on by default for the TLS reason, but other than that use case it's certainly worth a shot to see what starts crashing and burning.\n",
