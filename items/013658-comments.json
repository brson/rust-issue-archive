    "body": "Even assuming proper conversion from `Vec<T>` to `~[T]`, I think this brings up a valid point. `slice::from_fn` and `slice::from_elem` are not in anyway problematic with DST as they are provided a length at runtime. All the other functions removed in #13588 have to do with growing and shrinking, but `from_fn` and `from_elem` do not. It seems perfectly reasonable to reinstate them.\n",
