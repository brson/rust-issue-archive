Certainly LittleLock itself couldn't be initialized statically, but we could have a yet-more-primitive mutex that could still be initialized statically. Also, from a casual glance, LittleLock's destructor is just for deallocating the lock, which would not be necessary if we had the types defined in Rust.\n",
