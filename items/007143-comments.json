    "body": "Triage: no change.\n\nI'm personally ambivalent on this, but it might have some neat uses. FWIW, GHC is growing something tangentially related, [\"overloaded record fields\"](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/84), the core part of which is (in pseudo-Rust terms) essentially trait(s) `HasField` that give `T: HasField<\"foo\", int> + HasField<\"bar\", f32>` for\n\n``` rust\nstruct T {\n    foo: int,\n    bar: f32\n}\n```\n\nso FSU would essentially become normal matching against `HasField<\"foo\", T>` for the fields `foo: T` that aren't explicitly listed. (This can't currently work directly for Rust, since we don't have strings in the type system.)\n",
