    "body": "`unsafe` is for drawing a boundary between memory unsafe and memory safe code \n\nhttp://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#unsafety\n\nIt's not used to discourage the usage of safe APIs as that would break down the boundary and make it harder to identify memory safety issues. Usage of `unwrap` and `expect` is common in correct code, because there are invariants that are not encoded into the type system. Changing the meaning of `unsafe` would be a fundamental change to the design of the language / libraries so it would need to go through the RFC process (but it wouldn't be accepted).\n",
