    "body": "`impl of Trait for Type` changed to `impl Type: Trait` in [this heroic commit by @brson](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/commit/6a0720b439a4692f55d3b9951e74d452a7aef802) a month ago.\n\nBack when traits were called ifaces, there was such a thing as an [interface-less implementation](http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/0.3/tutorial.html#interface-less-implementations) that omitted the `of Trait` part; that's the part that used to be known as an \"`of` clause\".\n\nWe now have [trait-less implementations](http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#trait-less-implementations); the text in that section also needs to be edited to remove a mention of `of`.\n\nI think that \"\u2014the `of` clause refers to a type, rather than defining one.\" should just be nixed.\n",
