Could you please provide some rationale for this change as it's not immediately obvious? `Default::default()` is expected to be used sparingly and a static method on a trait can be used anywhere a regular function can, for example:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::default::Default;\n\nfn main() {\n    Some(42u).unwrap_or_else(Default::default);\n}\n```\n\nIf there's no pressing reason for the free-standing function, I don't think we should add it, to be honest.\n",

You would almost never see `Default` used in contexts where it was impossible to infer that trait's implementor. And when you do, as in your example, I think it's okay to use the extra `let` to help inference.\n\nccing @aturon just to make sure.\n",
