  "body": "in other words irrefutable ones without any bindings. This will be useful once the semantics of `_` in patterns changes to \"ignore\" instead of \"drop\" (#10488). Closes #11088.\n\nFor now it defaults to \"allow\", so I don't think there's any harm in this going in before #10488 itself, but please **DON'T** r+ this unless you're in a position to decide (or it has been decided).\n\nIf I run the tests with it set to \"deny\", things break in all of the expected places, with the exception that `deriving` code for unit structs also appears to trigger it. That should presumably be fixed before it gets changed to something other than \"allow\" (along with of course the expected failures).\n",
