    "body": "\"Creating a no-op task for every scheduler is not going to be an acceptable solution going forward. Is there a plan to avoid this?\"\n\nYes, I think this is ugly too. It should be easy to write a version of sched.bootstrap that does not take a task, I just haven't done it yet. This qualifies as \"polish\" in the sense that startup of the schedulers in the next iteration will change a fair bit to deal with independent work queues.\n\n\"In that case, can you remove the other context types from the enum and rename GlobalContext to NewRtContext or something?\"\n\nSounds like a good tweak. Will make this one now.\n",

    "body": "\"Why is SchedHome boxed?\"\n\nThis is referring to it being a ~ pointer right, Option<~SchedHome>? If so, no clue. I just wrote it that way. Maybe it makes sense for it to just be Option<SchedHome>. This is option-danced somewhat when tasks are sent between schedulers, so maybe I did it for reasons related to that.\n",
