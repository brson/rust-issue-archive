It's not the absolute end of the world if it doesn't for my own data structures (since I can just make my own version of `Cell`) but it means I can't put many other data structures inside a `Cell`, which actually affects program functionality.

The fact that it contains `UnsafeCell` is sort of immaterial, I feel.  There's no point in being conservative for the sake of it--what's going to change in the future that makes it more attractive to make `Cell` `Copy` than it already is?\n\nYour `UnsafeCell` point is good though, because I just checked and it's not `#[derive(Copy)]` either!  This actually affects me, because it means I **can't** make a type like `Cell` that is `Copy`.  Should I open a separate ticket for this?
