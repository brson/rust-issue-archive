    "body": "I think the intent was indeed to get the version output.  I think the phrasing is only odd in that it does not make that intent clear.  (It is possible I am wrong about the intent here.)\n\nBut there is an additional problem: Sometime between 0.10 and 0.11, we revised the `-v` / `--version` output to ensure it would be only one line when you do not supply an argument to `--version`.  This means we lose potentially relevant information, namely the host system type (e.g. `x86_64-apple-darwin` or `i686-apple-darwin`).\n\nWe could fix both of these problems by revising the instructions to say something like:\n\n> It's also helpful to provide the exact version and host by copying the output of re-running the erroneous rustc command with the `--version=verbose` flag, which will produce something like this:\n> \n> ```\n> rustc 0.12.0 (ba4081a5a 2014-10-07 13:44:41 -0700)\n> binary: rustc\n> commit-hash: ba4081a5a8573875fed17545846f6f6902c8ba8d\n> commit-date: 2014-10-07 13:44:41 -0700\n> host: i686-apple-darwin\n> release: 0.12.0\n> ```\n",
