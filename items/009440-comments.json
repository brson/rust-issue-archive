    "body": "I suppose I should elaborate a bit more. I personally don't like the `_iter` suffix everywhere when using iterators (especially in struct names), but I do agree that there are locations in which it is appropriate. I think that the four methods you've listed as retaining `iter` in them are appropriate, but all of the others I believe are just as natural without `_iter` than with.\n\nIt could be difficult in that `words` doesn't necessarily indicate that you're getting an iterator instead of an array, but I think that this isn't too bad.\n\nIf we do push forward with this, I think that other modules in libstd/extra should be checked to ensure that they adhere to this same convention, which is basically: \"Does it make sense without `_iter`? Then you can probably drop it.\"\n",

    "body": "I think `char_offset_iter()` could be `\u2192 char_indices()` (it's really chars and their byte indices)\n\nRegarding `chars().collect()` it has an issue with the size_hint which I'm unsure how to solve. The problem is that a char may require 1-4 bytes of allocation in the str. `CharIterator` uses the lower bound for its size hint and guesses that every remaining byte is part of a 4-byte encoded char. `FromIterator` for str however, I think it just allocates the lower bound of bytes, so it assumes 1 byte per char! This is unfortunately a pessimisation for the ascii case.  (Edit: The worst part is that I've written both of the methods).\n",
