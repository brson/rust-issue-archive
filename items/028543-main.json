  "body": "These changes introduce the ability to cross-compile working binaries for NetBSD/amd64. Previous support added in PR #26682 shared all its code with the OpenBSD implementation, and was therefore never functional (e.g. linking against non-existing symbols and using wrong type definitions). Nonetheless, the previous patches were a great starting point and made my work significantly easier. :smiley: \n\nBecause there are no stage0 snapshots for NetBSD (yet), I used a cross-compiler for NetBSD 7.0 RC3 and only tested some toy programs (threading and channels, stack guards, a small TCP/IP echo server and some other platform dependent bits). If someone could point me to documentation on how to generate a stage0 snapshot from a cross-compiler I'm happy to run the full test suite.\n\nA few other notes regarding Rust on NetBSD/amd64:\n- To preserve binary compatibility, NetBSD introduces new symbols for system call wrappers on breaking ABI changes and keeps the old (legacy) symbols around, see [this documentation](https://www.netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-processes.html#syscalls_master) for some details. I went ahead and modified the `libc` and `std` crate to use the current (renamed) symbols instead of the legacy ones where I found them, but I might have missed some. Notably using the `sigaction` symbol (deprecated in 1998) instead of `__sigaction14` even triggers SIGSYS (bad syscall) on my amd64 setup. I also changed the type definitions to use the most recent version.\n- NetBSD's gdb doesn't really support position independent executables, so you might want to turn that off for debugging, see [NetBSD Problem Report #48250](https://gnats.netbsd.org/48250).\n- For binaries invoked using a relative path, NetBSD supports `$ORIGIN` only for short `rpath`s (~64 chars or so, I'm told). If running an executable fails with `execname not specified in AUX vector: No such file or directory`, consider invoking the binary using its full absolute path.\n",
