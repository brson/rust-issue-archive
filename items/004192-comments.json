    "body": "r+ with a couple caveats:\n- it shouldn't cause anything else to break: I'm assuming this scope isn't going to accidentally cause stuff to be freed early or something? A trans scope isn't exactly a `{..}` lifetime-of-a-variable thing, right?\n- check that it's not a huge perf regression to be adding all these scopes. `perf stat` before-and-after runs to see.\n- enhance the comment in trans_stmt here so it points to region::resolve_stmt, and add a comment _there_ pointing back to trans::base::trans_stmt, so that both sites indicate their inter-relatedness.\n\nSorry, this stuff is delicate-city and I know we're likely to revisit it. Best to lay down invariant-describing docs as we go.\n",
