    "body": "IMO, the tests should be separate from the code. Oftentimes, the LOC for tests can get larger than the library itself. I like what Go does, where each source file `foo.go` has its own unit testing code in `foo_test.go`. `go test` just looks for these `*_test.go` files and runs them all against their respective source files. You can do something similar with Rust if you declare a module at the bottom of the source file and define the testing module in its own file, but then you have to import everything you want to test from the parent module. IMHO, this feels very clunky. I should at least _be able to_ separate my tests from the code in my library if I want to.\n",
