  "body": "This commit disables rustc's emission of rpath attributes into dynamic libraries\nand executables by default. The functionality is still preserved, but it must\nnow be manually enabled via a `-C rpath` flag.\n\nThis involved a few changes to the local build system:\n- --disable-rpath is now the default configure option\n- Makefiles now prefer our own LD_LIBRARY_PATH over the user's LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n  in order to support building rust with rust already installed.\n- The compiletest program was taught to correctly pass through the aux dir as a\n  component of LD_LIBRARY_PATH in more situations.\n\nThe major impact of this change is that neither rustdoc nor rustc will work\nout-of-the-box in all situations because they are dynamically linked. It must be\narranged to ensure that the libraries of a rust installation are part of the\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH. The default installation paths for all platforms ensure this,\nbut if an installation is in a nonstandard location, then configuration may be\nnecessary.\n\nAdditionally, for all developers of rustc, it will no longer be possible to run\n$target/stageN/bin/rustc out-of-the-box. The old behavior can be regained\nthrough the `--enable-rpath` option to the configure script.\n\nThis change brings linux/mac installations in line with windows installations\nwhere rpath is not possible.\n\nCloses #11747\n[breaking-change]\n",
