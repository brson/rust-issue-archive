    "body": "I am not sure if this makes sense.  I imagine a common use of `abs` is in some formulas where the result will still be combined with other ints, not uints.\n\nI imagine it is actually very unusual to have code where you have an int which could be negative and you need to supply that int to a uint context such that if the int is negative you want the absolute value.  I could imagine something like `int::to_uint()` which asserted that the int was indeed positive... currently we just do `i as uint` which is of course unsafe in this regard.\n",
