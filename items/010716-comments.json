    "body": "Allowing either seems like it would introduce some points that need to be carefully considered, e.g. for `use`s\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! conflict {\n     () => {\n        use bar::foo; \n        fn inner() { foo::func() }\n    }\n}\n\nmod foo { pub fn func() {} } // A\n\nmod bar {\n    pub mod foo { pub fn func() {} } // B\n}\n\nfn before() {\n    foo::func();\n}\n\nconflict!()\n\nfn after() {\n    foo::func();\n}\n```\n\nI see 3 possibilities if the above were legal:\n1. the `use` is scoped to the macro itself so `before` and `after` both call _A_, but `inner` calls _B_\n2. the `use` only rebinds `foo` in `after` (i.e. `before` calls _A_, and `inner` and `after` call _B_)\n3. the `use` is as if it were written at the top of the module, i.e. doesn't rebind `foo` at all (and so all three `foo::func()` call _A_)\n\nAll three have their peculiarities; I think 1 may make `pub use` impossible in a macro (without some custom re-exporting magic), 2 is weird (and I think disallowing this is one of the reasons that we currently only allow view items at the top of modules now), and 3 gives you spooky action-at-a-distance where an import magically appears (and can rebind other imports) throughout the whole file from some macro halfway down it (and it means that a macro that is importing something specifically can have it's symbol overwritten... I guess this may be addressed by hygiene and is point 1 anyway).\n\nSimilarly for top-level attributes, one can have, e.g. a `#[cfg]` being attached to a module from a macro invocation buried in the middle of the file.\n",
