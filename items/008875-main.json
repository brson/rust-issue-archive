  "body": "These commits fix bugs related to identically named statics in functions of implementations in various situations. The commit messages have most of the information about what bugs are being fixed and why.\n\nAs a bonus, while I was messing around with name mangling, I improved the backtraces we'll get in gdb by removing `__extensions__` for the trait/type being implemented and by adding the method name as well. Yay!\n",
