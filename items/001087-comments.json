    "body": "Phew! Finished this today after an embarrassing run of snapshots and partial-rewrites.\n\nThe new scheme is this:\n\n`log(*level*, *anything*)` is a built-in expression form. Level must be a `u32` expression, anything can be anything, just like the old log.\n\n`log_err` is gone\n\n`core::debug`, `core::info`, `core::warn` and `core::error` are defined in `core` (thus available everywhere as `debug`, `info`, `warn` and `error`) and defined as log levels 3, 2, 1, 0 respectively. So you can write `log(info, foo)` to get info-level logging of foo.\n\nThe macros `#debug(f, ...)`, `#info(f, ...)`, `#warn(f, ...)` and `#error(f, ...)` are defined in a synthetic chunk of macro-definition buried in the macro expander file (bad place to put it but it works for now, we can factor it out later) and expand to\n\n`log(core::debug, #fmt(f, ...))`\n\nand similar depending on the macro you use. So you _should_ wind up writing shorter and pithier logging bits using this, since you get #fmt thrown in for free. Just use `#debug(\"foo: %u, bar: %u\", f, b)` and you get nice output.\n\nThere remains some vestigial bad-word support for the words \"log_err\" and \"log_full\" in the last snapshots; those will roll over with the next snapshot and vanish but in the meantime the stage1..3 compilers no longer even know about those words.\n\nHopefully this is ok!\n",
