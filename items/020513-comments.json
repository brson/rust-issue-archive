Perhaps we should not have two `SliceExt` traits. Or perhaps the core one should not be in the prelude, if it is common to also want to use the collections one.\n",

So when both are in scope (regardless of their local name), we get \"multiple applicable methods in scope\" errors.\n\nOne solution is to only have `collections::slice::SliceExt` in scope. Since it \"re-exports\" (kind of) all the core methods, you don\u2019t need the other one. But `core::slice::SliceExt` is part of `core::prelude::*`, and _that\u2019s_ what makes `core::prelude::*` useless, while it was fine until recently. It\u2019s unfortunate.\n\nIs having a single `SliceExt` trait in `std::prelude::v1` is worth making `core::prelude::*` useless?\n\nTo take a step back, I was using `#![no_std]` because it wasn\u2019t hard and seemed to make the library more useful (usable in more contexts), but now that the runtime was removed maybe it doesn\u2019t matter?\n",

That way if you're in `no_std` land you can freely use the crates below `std`, and otherwise you still see a nice one-trait API.\n\n@alexcrichton thoughts?\n",
