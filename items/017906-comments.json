    "body": "This looks like an LLVM optimizer bug to me. As best as I can tell, LLVM has decided to optimize out two functions that I need and I have no idea why. I've managed to work around the issue by marking those functions `#[inline(never)]`. DaGenix/rust-crypto@70a13bce52f08493649fffdf3d741b01a3d1c224 now works. The previous commit, DaGenix/rust-crypto@5d15e450ea27c3bd164f6930fb87628cb237e9e8, does not. The only difference is the presence of two `#[inline(never)]` annotations.\n\nI have no idea how to come up with a smaller test case. If LLVM's optimizing is indeed the culprit, it appears to me that whatever is triggering it must be some sort of odd corner case or it would have impacted Rust itself.\n\nThis bug looks pretty unpleasant to me. I'd suggest either reverting LLVM or expediting upgrading it to a new version that has fixed the issue. I tried to uprade LLVM, but quickly ran into issues due to LLVM API changes that I didn't know how to fix.\n",
