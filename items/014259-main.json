  "body": "Excluding the functions inherited from the cast module last week (with marked\nstability levels), these functions received the following treatment.\n- size_of - this method has become #[stable]\n- nonzero_size_of/nonzero_size_of_val - these methods have been removed\n- min_align_of - this method is now #[stable]\n- pref_align_of - this method has been renamed without the\n  `pref_` prefix, and it is the \"default alignment\" now. This decision is in line\n  with what clang does (see url linked in comment on function). This function\n  is now #[stable].\n- init - renamed to zeroed and marked #[stable]\n- uninit - marked #[stable]\n- move_val_init - renamed to overwrite and marked #[stable]\n- {from,to}_{be,le}{16,32,64} - all functions marked #[stable]\n- swap/replace/drop - marked #[stable]\n- size_of_val/min_align_of_val/align_of_val - these functions are marked\n  #[unstable], but will continue to exist in some form. Concerns have been\n  raised about their `_val` prefix.\n",
