    "body": "Tests would be good here, yeah. Also -- this is weird to mention -- but reading it now and looking at the variants, I think maybe I'd expect the comma-list to be OR-ed and multiple juxtaposed `#[cfg(...)]` attributes to be AND-ed. That is, I think my eyes scan\n\n```\n#[cfg(linux,osx)]\n#[cfg(debug)]\nfn foo() { ... }\n```\n\nas meaning \"(linux OR osx) AND debug\", rather than \"(linux AND osx) OR debug\" as I think this patch implements. But I'm not sure it matters, so long as there's some canonical reading. Do you have a strong feeling, yourself?\n",
