    "body": "I see two possible solutions.  One is to have borrowck remove the entries from last_use.  This sounds both complex and a bit fragile.  The other is to remove last_use and ask users to manually annotate moves.  \n\nIt is a bit unclear to me what will be the impact of removing last_use on usability.  On the one hand, it's a nice way to avoid excess use of the unary move operator.  On the other hand, it's a common source of confusion (\"why am I getting a copy warning here but not there? oh, I see, that's a last-use\").  Also, when you add borrowck into the equation, it's one more thing that users have to think about (\"it's not a last use because there is an existing alias in scope\").  On the other hand, people will probably end up understanding the idea of \"alias in scope\" anyway.\n",

Apparently there is a difference between how explicit moves are compiled, and how implicit (last-use) moves are compiled: even if I change the code so that trans still pays attention to the results of last-use, but the kind checker requires explicit moves on last uses, performance still gets much worse (for example, the typechecking pass takes 18s in stage 1, as opposed to 5s in stage 0).\n\nSo I'm not checking anything in yet :-(\n",
