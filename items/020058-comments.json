    "body": "So, I rebased my branch, but have a few remaining questions/undecided methods:\n- Should I put work into making `CharEq` more general for now? (Eg, the `impl CharEq for &mut P where P: CharEq` proposal) \n- I marked `match_indices` as unstable for now, because its semantic might change to return an iterator over `(uint, &str)` (match, and its offset). The question is, should we do this change?\n- I had last minutes thoughts about the stability of `find` / `rfind`. In principle `.find(foo)` can be replaced with `.match_indices(foo).map(|(i, _)| i).next()`, so its not strictly necessary. On the one hand, we might want to keep it as convenience and for familiarity with other languages string APIs, which often provide such a function as low level building block. On the other hand, in Rust it wouldn't really be the low level building block, but just another consumer of the matcher iterators, so it might make sense to not provide it at all.\n- I also marked `split_terminator` as unstable for now, as I need to re-research whether it is a common function to provide in a languages string library. On option would be to make it a constructor function on `Split` itself, so that you could do `.split(pat).terminator()` - it would take `self` by value and construct a wrapper around the iterator type. The only issue here is that you could call it even after you already started iterating with the `Split` iterator, which would make it only well defined if called on a freshly constructed `Split`. (I think this was the reasoning that lead me to leave-in the terminator variations of split to begin with)\n- I left `subslice_offset` as unstable for now, as it doesn't really belong to the pattern-using methods on strings. The question is whether we want to support this operation at all for slices - if yes, then we probably should provide it for slice types in general, and it should probably get changed to return a `Option<uint>` instead of panicing.\n",

    "body": "> Should I put work into making CharEq more general for now\n\nNah I think what we have right now is fine, adding more impls should be backwards compatible.\n\n> I marked match_indices as unstable for now ... should we do this change?\n\nI think it's fine being `#[unstable]` for now, and we can focus on the API later when stabilizing it.\n\n> I had last minutes thoughts about the stability of find / rfind.\n\nDue to `match_indices` being unstable for now, I think we need to call these `#[stable]`. I also do think that they're nice conveniences to have and we'd probably want them regardless.\n\n> I also marked split_terminator as unstable for now\n\nOk!\n\n> I left subslice_offset as unstable for now.\n\nSounds good to me!\n\nThanks again @Kimundi, this is all super awesome!\n",
