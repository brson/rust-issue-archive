  "body": "Fixes #2566.\n\nI had to do a bit of refactoring to make this work, because there is already a to_str instance for \\forall T.@T, and hashmap has type @{...}, so I couldn't make a to_str instance for hashmap. Instead, I factored out the raw record type as \"inner\", and put the to_str instance on that. This required moving the private helper methods onto inner as well, which I guess works fine because of magical auto-dereferencing when calling them.\n\nThe thing I most worry about is that I have somehow changed the memory layout / behavior of hashmaps by doing this, but I don't _think_ so.\n\nThere seems to be an aesthetic choice here between calling to_str on the keys and values, versus printing them with \"%?\". I chose the former as more consistent, but the latter produces slightly more useful output (printing strings quoted, e.g.) It seems like there should be a more unified notion of how to print things, somehow. Shouldn't \"%?\" be using the to_str iface, where present? Is there some iface it does use?\n\n[Oh, and the actual printing code, which was the least trouble in this whole exercise, is stolen from the json module, which is why it uses a writer. I could do something else if it would be more idiomatic.]\n",
