    "body": "Travis failure says run-pass/crate-name-attr-used.rs failed, because `rustc` provided `--crate-name crate-name-attr-used` when compiling, which conflicted with the `#![crate_name = \"test\"]` attribute.\n\nI'm also not really clear what the motivation is for requiring `--crate-name` and `#[crate_name]` to be in sync, though I assume you have one or you wouldn't have submitted this.\n\nAnyway, r=me with the test fixed and the comment updated.\n",
