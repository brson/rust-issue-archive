    "body": "@alexcrichton Let's start with the underlying concern this PR is trying to address: to make panic messages more helpful by e.g. pointing to details about debugging or backtraces. I think this is quite legitimate: many newcomers to Rust will encounter panics first through `unwrap`, and be quite frustrated by a pointer into the source code of libcore, without knowing what to do next.\n\nIn other words, I disagree with:\n\n> Panic messages should never be a user visible error, so it's unclear how much effort we want to put forward into making them look nice\n\nI think the perspective here is really about _developers_, especially newbies, though it's worth thinking about the end-user experience as well. However, [custom handlers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1328) will likely help the end-user story for robust apps. (This also addresses your final point.)\n\n> By splitting the output on multiple lines, this means that concurrent panic messages will be interleaved and difficult to read by default\n\nFair point -- let's see if we can find a way to solve the problem while keeping to just one line.\n\n> This is a pretty core part of the standard library, so it's likely someone's relying on the output format\n\nIndeed. And this isn't something we can easily assess via crater, so we'd need to advertise this widely in some way.\n\nCould we shrink this change by just adding a short `(see <SOME_URL> for help)` where the link explains panics, backtraces, and how to break on panic in a debugger?\n",

    "body": "Yes I agree with the thrust here, but I also think there's always a price to pay when adding all these \"easy to debug\" features. An example of this is how we have backtrace support via `RUST_BACKTRACE`, but this is also easily obtained through debuggers like gdb/lldb. We receive complaints from time to time about the portability of the standard library or the size of binaries which pulling libbacktrace along doesn't help with. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that features we add to help newbies need to be weighed against their technical debt and maintenance cost. I don't think it's the case that \"this is more user friendly\" is an automatic \"oh sure, let's land it!\"\n\nFor example, even if we were to include some sort of URL in the text that's now a link we need to maintain for a very long time to make sure it always works. Not only that, but that text will be embedded in all future rust executables (which may or may not be desired). My own personal feeling as well is that after you see the link once it's basically always extra text you need to scan over.\n\nOne possible case study for leaving as-is is the `assert` macro in C, which has a similar message as our panic messages. It's certainly opaque if you run into it accidentally, but I don't think there's much thrust to change it to have fancy formatting or anything. \n",

    "body": "I do think the user experience matters here, and the current isn't great. Of @alexcrichton's concerns, the interleaving of panics bothers me most, though with the line number and task number remaining on the same line, at least you can figure out where in the source code the panic was, even if you can't figure out what the message was.\n\nRegarding the backtrace suggestion, I'm not sure that 'note: ' is the proper UI here - that's the compiler's UI, and there's no similar precedent in the standard library. I do tend to think that the first time a newbie sees a panic is the best time to inform them about what to do about it, but am sympathetic that this adds a lot of noise - a multithreaded program that panics a bunch is going to be too helpful with all the backtrace suggestions.\n",

I'm just trying to get a very short thing we can add that acts as a pointer to more information. That helps with the multiline concern as well as the noisy output concern.
