    "body": "Hmm, you know, a couple things:\n- The message is wrong but not for the reason you suggest.  You _are_ copying the field `f` from `a` which is non-copyable.\n- _However_, in fact I believe that `a` should be being _moved_ here, which means that you are actually _moving_ the field `f` from `a` which should be ok.\n\nWhen doing my recent patch, I removed most of these \"copyability\" checks from `kind.rs` for this reason (that is, those copies would not actually be moves if the type were non-copyable) but I left this one.  However, I think there is no need at all to check whether the base is non-copyable.\n",
