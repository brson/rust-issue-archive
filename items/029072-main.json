  "body": "This commit generalises parsing of associative operators from left-associative\nonly (with some ugly hacks to support right-associative assignment) to properly\nleft/right-associative operators.\n\nParsing is still is not general enough to handle non-associative,\nnon-highest-precedence prefix or non-highest-precedence\npostfix operators (e.g. `..` range syntax) and should be made to be.\n\nLastly, this commit adds support for parsing right-associative `<-` (left arrow)\noperator with precedence higher than assignment as the operator for placement-in\nfeature.\n\n---\n\nThis PR still needs various non-parser changes (e.g. src/grammar and tests) and I\u2019m still working on these; the meat of the PR can already be reviewed, though, I think.\n\nPlease review carefully. I made sure that quirks I have discovered so far are preserved (see e.g. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29071) and am looking for more corner cases as I continue to work on tests et al, but there may be something I haven\u2019t noticed or accounted for.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m also not sure I managed to preserve all the semantics with the range operator inside non-trivial expressions since these are a mess at the moment. Crater runs would be nice.\n",
