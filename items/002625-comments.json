    "body": "Here are some things I think are issues with `core::run`:\n- There are 4 different API calls for starting child processes, and the most flexible call returns a process id instead of a `Program` value:\n  \n  ```\n  pub fn spawn_process(prog: &str, args: &[~str],\n                       env: &Option<~[(~str,~str)]>,\n                       dir: &Option<~str>,\n                       in_fd: c_int, out_fd: c_int, err_fd: c_int) -> pid_t { ... }\n  pub fn run_program(prog: &str, args: &[~str]) -> int { ... }\n  pub fn start_program(prog: &str, args: &[~str]) -> Program { ... }\n  pub fn program_output(prog: &str, args: &[~str]) -> ProgramOutput { ... }\n  ```\n\nThis is awkward because if (for example) you have been using `program_output` but then decide you need to change the current directory of the subprocess, you need to switch to using `spawn_process` and duplicate a bunch of code from `core::run` in order to read everything from stdout/stderr. This issue has lead to duplicate code in `librustc/markdown_writer.rs` and `compiletest/procsrv.rs`.\n\nIdeally I think there would be just one API call to start a process, and that call would return a `Program`.\n- `core::run.Program.finish` returns the exit code of the process... but when called again it returns 0. I think it would make more sense for the exit code to be stored from the first call and returned from all subsequent calls. The documentation should also describe the behaviour.\n- On Unix platforms, there are race conditions that can happen if a user gets the process id out of a `Program` and calls `run::waitpid` themselves - because the `Program` will then call `run::waitpid` again... but the first call to `run::waitpid` will have freed up the process id and it might now belong to a different process. I think that perhaps `run::waitpid` should be removed from the public API to fix this issue.\n- There is a similar race condition in `core::run.Program.force_destroy` / `destroy` ... it might end up killing a different process due to a re-used process id.\n- `core::run::program_output` returns the output of stdout/stderr as ~str values, which assumes the output is utf-8, which doesn't seem like a safe assumption.\n- The documentation should make clear that the `Program` destructor will wait for the process to finish.\n\nDoes anyone else feel that these are issues? Should they be solved in ways other than I suggested? If there are no problems with the above then I will try to submit some pull requests.\n",
