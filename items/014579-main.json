  "body": "This completes the last stage of the renaming of the comparison hierarchy of\ntraits. This change renames TotalEq to Eq and TotalOrd to Ord.\n\nIn the future the new Eq/Ord will be filled out with their appropriate methods,\nbut for now this change is purely a renaming change.\n\nThis continues the work of #12517, continuing the work in #14534. This patch accomplishes the final rename of `TotalEq` to `TotalOrd`. I wanted to get this patch landed ASAP so we don't have to deal much with \"where did `Eq` and `Ord` go?\"\n\nI have yet to do another pruning pass over the compiler to change all usage of `PartialEq` to `Eq` where appropriate. I will do this soon as well.\n",
