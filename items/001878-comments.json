Good work.\n\nMy primary concern going forward is that we get some networking capability set up soon, so let's push on that next.\n\nThen maybe we can go back and do some refactoring. The current implementation imposes quite a bit of overhead with all the message passing, the 16-random-byte vector allocation and generation, and allocating all handles on the heap.\n\nThe windows and freebsd bots are having some difficulties with this. I'll investigate (and you can too), and once we resolve those we can push this to master.\n",

    "body": "I did some debugging today. This is what I said in IRC earlier:\n- pfox___: what I believe is happening is that by dereffing the op_handle async_t we have no refs at all to the event loop, so the first thing that happens when you try to pump the loop is that it just exits. I think you need to keep that handle reffed and deref it from within the loop before exiting\n- it's a lot of conjecture, but I do see the event loop exit as soon I do the async_send, and if I modify things to not deref the async handle, then process_operation does end up running _something_\n\n@olsonjeffery Can you take another look at this and see if restructuring it in such a way fixes the problem?\n",
