    "body": "It looks like the canonical answer here is a `#[repr(u8)]` enum containing two private variants, like `libc::c_void`, as described in PR #11539. But it's not clear whether that is simply the _optimized_ option, or the _only_ ABI-valid option for `void *`. `std::os::raw::c_void` also provides its own copy of the structure.\n\nBut @crumblingstatue wants to newtype this for type safety, and it isn't clear whether newtyping this structure (`struct Foo(c_void)`) gives us something of the same ABI as `c_void` itself. The rust repo itself doesn't seem to ever do so, but has a few type aliases (`type Foo = *mut libc::c_void`), which provide _worse_ type safety than C, since these pointers can be freely assigned to each other.\n\nA few places in the rust repo, some external docs, and some projects (including Servo) use `*mut ()` as a void-pointer type.\n\nI can see few options here:\n1. Stabilize the representation of a raw pointer to `#[repr(C)] struct Foo;` as ABI-compatible with C opaque struct pointers (which would incidentally stabilize `*mut ()`).\n2. Stabilize `#[repr(C)] enum Foo {}`, which was suggested on #rust as better because you can't construct one. Right now that doesn't compile, so this is clearly backwards-compatible.\n3. Ensure that the newtype approach, `struct Foo(c_void)`, works, and stabilize it.\n4. Document that people should make their own two-private-variant `#[repr(u8)]` enums. Maybe make a macro?\n\nWhatever the answer, it should be documented in the book's FFI section as well as in the doc comment on `libc::c_void`.\n",

    "body": "Note that the only reason `c_void` has two variants is to allow the `#[repr(u8)]` tag, and the only reason that's done is so LLVM can recognize `malloc` and `free` and enable the various optimizations around memory allocation. I don't believe there are any other optimizations you miss out on from something like `struct Foo;` or just a plain `enum Foo {}`.\n\nI personally would not recommend `struct Foo;` as a pattern because it's not serving its purpose of an opaque type marker (you can construct an instance via `Foo`). In bindings I've written I typically use `enum Foo {}` (note the lack of `repr`) and it works when you only use `*mut Foo` in the FFI bindings.\n",
