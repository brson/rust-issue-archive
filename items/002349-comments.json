    "body": "I think this should definitely use `700` like the POSIX [`mkdtemp`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/mkdtemp.html), otherwise it's not usable for safely making a temporary work area within a world-writable directory. If it starts off allowing other users to create files in it, you can't then use regular file names inside it without fear of them already being created - possibly as hardlinks. I can't really think of a use case for a randomized directory name which other users have read/write permissions on.\n",
