But I am not advocating that position.)\n\n(However, given that #21972 just landed today, it may be a good idea to let the code settle for a week before we actually make a decision about this.  Its super easy to remove `#[unsafe_destructor]`, as one can see from the [two commits here](https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust/commits/b6e48e6985bd8f19bc54069ffa632197da37ed41), its just a matter of having the will to do it. :)  )\n",
