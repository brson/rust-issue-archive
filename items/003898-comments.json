    "body": "There is no two levels of indirection since it's an array and not a double pointer in curses. In your C code, the implicit array-to-pointer conversion does what you expect, but straight-up telling `rustc` that the symbol `boolnames` refers to a double pointer instead of a series of single pointers can't go well.\n\nI don't know how to properly deal with unknown-but-static-length arrays in rust, but if you change the `extern` declaration to `const boolnames: [*c_char * 1];` and then say `let mut p: **c_char = ptr::to_unsafe_ptr(&boolnames[0]);`, it'll print a pile of stuff and not segfault.\n",
