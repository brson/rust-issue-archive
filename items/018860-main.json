  "body": "Previously, the stability summary page attempted to associate impl\nblocks with the module in which they were defined, rather than the\nmodule defining the type they apply to (which is usually, but not\nalways, the same). Unfortunately, due to the basic architecture of\nrustdoc, this meant that impls from re-exports were not being counted.\n\nThis commit makes the stability summary work the same way that rustdoc's\nrendered output does: all methods are counted alongside the type they\napply to, no matter where the methods are defined.\n\nIn addition, for trait impl blocks only the stability of the overall\nblock is counted; the stability of the methods within is not\ncounted (since that stability level is part of the trait definition).\n\nFixes #18812\n",
