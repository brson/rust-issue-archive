  "body": "This is an alternative version to https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8268, where instead of transitioning to `get()` completely, I transitioned to `unwrap()` completely.\n\nMy reasoning for also opening this PR is that having two different functions with identical behavior on a common datatype is bad for consistency and confusing for users, and should be solved as soon as possible. The fact that apparently half the code uses `get()`, and the other half `unwrap()` only makes it worse.\n\nIf the final naming decision ends up different, there needs to be a big renaming anyway, but until then it should at least be consistent.\n\n---\n- Made naming schemes consistent between Option, Result and Either\n- Lifted the quality of the either and result module to that of option\n- Changed Options Add implementation to work like the maybe Monad (return None if any of the inputs is None)  \n  See https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6002, especially my last comment.\n- Removed duplicate Option::get and renamed all related functions to use the term `unwrap` instead  \n  See also https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/7887.\n\nTodo: \n\nAdding testcases for all function in the three modules. Even without the few functions I added, the coverage wasn't complete to begin with. But I'd rather do that as a follow up PR, I've touched to much code here already, need to go through them again later.\n",
