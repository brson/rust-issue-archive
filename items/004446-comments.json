(what version of rustc are you using? durable was replaced with &static at some point)\n[12:36:32] <@nmatsakis> bstrie: in any case, if it needs durable, it should say so.  This may have something to do with the fact that kinds are a kind of bit set and in fact owned should imply durable...\n```\n",
