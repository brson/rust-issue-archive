    "body": "@thestinger This was motivated by my desire to `impl CheckedAdd for char`, though I'm unlikely to actually do that. I still thought it was worth submitting because there's no reason for `CheckedAdd` to require `Add`. Your statement that you can always have a non-`Option` variant only seems to work for types that wrap. Non-wrapping types can't necessarily have an unchecked variant, same with types that have invalid holes within their range (as `char` does, with the `0xD800-0xDFFF` block).\n",
