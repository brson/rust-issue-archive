Then in expansion pass, it becomes `ast::Ident`, although not independent from `ExprForLoop`, `ExprLoop`, `ExprBreak` or `ExprAgain`. Then again in resolve pass, it lives in `label_ribs`, not `value_ribs` as other variables do, which I believe is the root cause.\n\nThis really is the identity (no pun intended) crisis for poor labels.\n",

    "body": "@huonw , @edwardw \n\nOkay, we want to be careful about this. In fact, I claim that we may very well _want_ the behavior described in this issue.  Specifically, when we try to separate loop labels from hygiene, we either break or seriously restrict the ability of macros to expand into terms containing loop labels. Specifically, suppose I write a macro like\n\nmy_loop!(break, <big long expression using break as a loop label>)\n\nThe problem here is that you don't know whether 'break' will be a label or not when the macro gets expanded.\n\nI think that we have two good choices here: _don't_ have hygiene for loop labels, or allow them to shadow bindings. I think that the other solutions are not going to work out.\n\nWell, okay, there's one other thing you could do; you could make them permanently syntactically distinct, so that they always have to appear with their tick. Making this work correctly will require the lifetime parsing to happen at the token tree level--but I think it might already happen that way--but also, you need to push the change inward, so that the Names are permanently distinct. One easy way to do that would just be to put the tick in as part of the interned string. This would solve the problem, and it would not require separate tables.\n\nOne tricky element here is that you've added a new invariant--the idents appearing in Lifetimes _must_ have the tick attached to the string, or all hell breaks loose. The quote-unquote right way to fix this would be to get rid of the separate \"Lifetime\" structure, but that would probably be painful.\n\nOpinions?\n",

    "body": "### (My) Summary\n\n#### Why is this issue happening?\n\nThe hygienic label works by renaming itself with respect to its lexical scope. The renaming of a label needs to be propagated into its loop body for `break` or `continue` to pick up so that they refer to the right renamed label. Unfortunately, both label and normal identifier are represented as `ast::Ident` so any identifiers inside that loop body with the same name will pick up the renaming too and be erroneously (IMO) be renamed.\n\n#### What #12563 has proposed\n\n#12563 tried to add namespaces to renaming operation so that label and normal identifier won't collide.\n\n#### jbclements' concern and suggestion\n\n@jbclements claims that such behavior may very well be what we want. By hardcoding namespace, we may restrict the ability of macro expansion. He then suggests to have one flat namespace as-is but try to distinguish them 'symbolically', i.e. label not only has `'` in it textually but also compiler internally. It is another way of doing namespace if I understand him correctly, only more free-form.\n",
