    "body": "Re: #14798 -- Remove old (boxed) closures from the language \n\nAre we going to replace all the uses of boxed closures in the standard library with unboxed closures? I think that in some cases it may not be doable (*) without [abstract return types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/105) (ART). Let me explain why with a (rather long) story:\n\n(*) Ok, it may be doable, but tedious. See alternatives section at the bottom:\n\n---\n\nI was navigating ancient issues today, and found #12677: \"`std::str::Bytes` should implement `Clone`\". So I decided to investigate why `string.bytes()` wasn't cloneable:\n\nThe `bytes` method returns an `iter::Map` which can't implement clone. This is the current definition of `iter::Map`:\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(Clone)]\nstruct Map<'a, A, B, I> {\n    iter: I,\n    f: |A|:'a -> B,  //~ error: type `|A| -> B` does not implement any method in scope named `clone`\n}\n```\n\nSo, my first attempt at a solution was: \"Let's change `Map` to use unboxed closures\":\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(Clone)]\nstruct Map<A, B, I: Iterator<A>, F: FnMut(A) -> B> {\n    iter: I,\n    f: F,\n}\n\nimpl<A, B, I: Iterator<A>, F: FnMut(A) -> B> Iterator<B> for Map<A, B, I, F> {\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<B> {\n        self.iter.next().map(|elt| self.f.call_mut((elt,)))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhich compiles fine, it's cloneable and should work in principle, but when I tried to replicate the `bytes` method, I found a more serious problem:\n\n``` rust\nfn bytes<'a>(slice: &'a str) -> () {\n    Map {\n        iter: slice.as_bytes().iter(),\n        f: |&mut: &b| b,\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI wrote `()` as the return type to make the compiler tell me what's the actual return type:\n\n``` rust\nerror: mismatched types: expected `()`, found `Map<_, _, core::slice::Items<'_, u8>, closure>` (expected (), found struct Map)\n```\n\nNote the 4th specialization argument of `Map`: `closure`. I realized that this function is impossible to define because the return type can't be \"named\", in particular the unboxed closure has an anonymous type.\n\nIf we had ART, then the return type could be `Map<&'a u8, u8, slice::Items<'a, u8>, impl <'a> FnMut(&'a u8) -> u8`, or more succinctly, just: `impl Iterator<u8>`.\n\n---\n\n### Alternatives\n\nSince we don't have ART, here are a few alternatives for the particular case of the `bytes` method:\n- Make `bytes` return a `Bytes` struct that implements `Iterator<u8>`. This basically bypasses the use of unboxed closures, buts add yet another struct to the library.\n- Create a `DerefCopy` struct that implements the general `|:&mut &t| t` operation, and change the return type of bytes to `Map<_, _, _, DerefCopy>`. The `DerefCopy` could be used in some other places of the stdlib.\n\n---\n\n@aturon This is relevant to the library stabilization process:\n- As part of the stabilization of `std::iter`, are we going to fully move to unboxed closures?\n- If yes, how do we dealt with these cases where the return type that can't be named?\n- Are we going to stabilize functions that return iterator adapters? Or perhaps should we mark them as `[unstable = \"return type may change\"]` to account for the introduction of ART in the future.\n",

    "body": "@japaric Note that you will be able to use \"unboxed closures\" in boxed form, something like: `Box<Fn(uint) -> uint>` for example. For library stabilization, we will be switching all APIs currently using closures to use the new closure system, but they will not necessarily all be _boxed_.\n\nThis is just the usual tradeoff between generics (with specialization) and trait objects (with dynamic dispatch). Right now, since we don't have abstract \"unboxed\" return types, anything returning a closure will have to use the trait object (boxed) form.\n\nPut another way, \"unboxed closures\" is really an unfortunate misnomer. What's really changing is that closures are going away as a \"special\" thing, and instead being replaced by use of the existing trait system. That means you can choose to use them in both boxed and unboxed forms.\n\nAs we've been stabilizing APIs, we've been leaving anything that uses closures as `#[unstable]` for this reason. We'll be making a sweep later and determining which kinds of closures to use once the feature is ready.\n",
