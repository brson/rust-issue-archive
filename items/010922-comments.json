    "body": "This is working as designed. Whereas you were controlling the library's name with `#[link(name=\"foo\")];` before, you must do this with `#[pkgid=\"foo\"];` now.\n\nThe rust compiler used to infer the name \"liblib-HASH-VERSION\" for lib.rs, and does so still, so that behavior hasn't changed at all. I think in this case even the hash ids would have collided assuming the libs didn't have dependencies.\n\nYou can't have the library be called something different than the package id if we want rustpkg to work in its current form. It uses the pkgid to know where to get what it needs to build. So if you have `github.com/kballard/rust-lua` it is going to look for librust-lua at that location. You can control the name at the point of use by using `extern mod lua = \"github.com/kballard/rust-lua\";`\n",

    "body": "@metajack: Your [own blog post](http://metajack.im/2013/12/11/building-rust-code--current-issues/) recommends `#[pkgid]` be of the form `github.com/kballard/rust-lua#0.1` (assuming that's the correct URL, of course). The problem with this is my library is supposed to be called `lua`, not `rust-lua`. This is a problem that rustpkg needs to fix, not one that needs to be enshrined as a core language \"feature\". And no, requiring all users to say `extern mod lua = \"github.com/kballard/rust-lua\"` is not a good fix.\n\nThe standard way to deal with this in Go is to have the actual library be one level deeper in the repo, i.e. `github.com/kballard/go-lua/lua` (note: this project does not actually exist). AFAIK, rustpkg still does not support doing this.\n\nIn any case, there are two issues I have with this current implementation:\n1. Libraries that don't declare `#[pkgid]` are now completely screwed. Assuming a common convention of `lib.rs`, every single library that doesn't have `#[pkgid]` now hashes to the same `liblib-9ed81b85-0.0.<ext>`. That's a serious collision issue. The only libraries that are immune are ones that use a custom filename for the root file.\n2. Libraries that do declare `#[pkgid]` must now choose between using a semantically-meaningful `#[pkgid]`, such as the one suggested by your blog post that looks like `github.com/kballard/rust-lua`, or one that produces the desired library name.\n\nI do not understand why this change was made. I mean, I fully understand the desire to make hashes computable externally instead of relying on an obscure (from the perspective of external tools) hashing algorithm operating over an unknown collection of metadata. But it seems like that could be accomplished without also making the library name dependent on this same piece of metadata. What's wrong with still using `#[link(name=\"foo\")]` (or is it `#[link(package_id=\"foo\")]`? I have both set to the same string) to produce the actual library name and then the `#[pkgid]` for the hash?\n",

    "body": "@brson: I'm not clear on exactly what limitations rustpkg has for figuring out the library name/hash given a URL. Surely it can't require _just_ the URL, or the version would cause an issue. But assuming the path is still important, the same solution that Go uses could be employed here, in that my library would become `github.com/kballard/rust-lua/lua`. This requires rustpkg be able to support this sort of thing, though.\n\nThat said, I think that making rustpkg happy should not impact rust as a whole. I should be able to use rust without having to worry about rustpkg if I don't want to. And by that I mean I should be able to continue using `github.com/kballard/rust-lua` as the location for my library, if I don't care about rustpkg compatibility (and at the moment I don't as I rely on a custom Makefile to build my library). I like the idea of using the canonical library location + version as the unique identifier that is used for the hash, but I don't think it should affect the library name. The library name should be computed from link attributes (is it `#[link(name=\"foo\")]` or `#[link(package_id=\"foo\")]`? That's never been clear to me), falling back to the root source filename if there are no link attributes (or maybe falling back to the pkgid path if there are no link attributes, thus simplifying the common case of a rustpkg-compatible library).\n\nWith this approach, all existing libraries would keep their existing name, and only have their hash change (which is perfectly acceptable). And libraries that ditch link attributes and use just `#[pkgid]`, which I'm assuming was the idea here, would end up with the same name as they do with @metajack's change.\n",

    "body": "@metajack: I think you're completely missing the point. Actually, missing two very important points.\n\nThe first is that all existing libraries are now screwed, unless they happened to use their library name as the name for the root rust file. Some libraries do, but a lot don't (and I believe the current recommended convention is to use `lib.rs`). Every library that did not happen to use its own name as the root file now has the completely wrong name, and is at serious risk of name collision.\n\nThe second is that `#[pkgid=\"lua\"]` is a terrible solution. That will lead to a name collision with any other library that uses the same `#[pkgid=\"lua\"]`. Using a unique package id is an extremely good idea, regardless of whether you care about rustpkg compatibility, in order to get a unique hash. The best way of doing this is using the canonical project location, as that's a string that you can reasonably guarantee will be unique.\n\nIn fact, the _only_ reasonable solution I have available to me with this patch is to use a name that's _almost_ my project repo, but with an extra path component at the end containing the real name of my library. This is _lying_ about the package id just to satisfy the rules for library naming, and it feels completely unacceptable to me. The only reason why I should ever use `github.com/kballard/rust-lua/lua` as my package id is if I actually move the library into the `lua` subfolder of my project! But besides the fact that I don't want to do that, my understanding is that this will break rustpkg compatibility (not that rust-lua is compatible, but other libraries are) because rustpkg doesn't know how to deal with a library that's in a subfolder.\n\nSee my response to @brson for how I wish this to work. Link metadata in order to produce a library name seems like the right approach. `#[pkgid]` in order to produce the library hash seems like the right approach as well, along with a strong recommendation to use a unique string (e.g. project path#version) as the id. The problem is using `#[pkgid]` to produce the library name, as that just seems unusable.\n",

That's what I meant when I was asking how rustpkg deals with this. Saying `extern mod lua = \"github.com/kballard/rust-lua/lua\"` doesn't provide enough information to compute a library hash, as it's missing the version (and it's assuming the pkgid is the same as the import string).

The problem with existing libraries is more that the link attributes weren't disallowed, which meant existing libraries would compile without any errors or warnings, but would silently produce an unexpected library name. If we disallow the existing link attributes, and then modify `#[pkgid]` the way @metajack has summarized, that would fix both issues I raised.\n",
