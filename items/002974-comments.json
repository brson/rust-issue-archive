    "body": "Some arguments in favor: there are many cases where ignoring a value is a bug.  In trans, for example, ignoring a returned block context is easy to do but almost always constitutes a bug.  This in particular is a refactoring hazard: if some function used to return unit because it did not create control flow, but is modified to return a block context, it is easy to fail to find all uses of that function.\n\nOther arguments: a common source of error is ignoring return values that indicate error.  Given that we do not have exceptions, such return values will be common, whether they take the form of sentinel values or `result<>`/`option<>` types.  We should not let them be easily ignored.\n\nFinal argument: It encourages the (good, in my opinion) style of having side-effecting functions return unit.  In cases, like `insert()` for hashmaps, where a function is primarily intended for its side effect but also has a useful return, it encourages there to be two functions, one that returns unit and one that does not.  This makes for clearer code.  I find it very convenient to write `if set.insert(...)` in order to add to a set, but not especially clear. \n",

    "body": "Strongly disagree with this for general functions due to expressions having so many side effects, but I do agree that it would be nice to have a trait that requires you to not ignore the value.  For instance `Result` types should never be ignored because that would mean you can suppress an error.  Since there is now trait inheritance that could extend a `NonIgnorable` trait.\n\nWhy would you not make that the default?  Because too many things have side effects in the sense that the expression result stays on the stack.  Sometimes you might also want to have functions that return something the same instance for chaining and then it is again very annoying if you have to ignore the final return value.\n",
