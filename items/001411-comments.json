    "body": "I've discussed this with the DNS provider upstream and this seems to be a limitation of the rewriting system they're using. We can CNAME the subdomains but not the root (RFC limitation), so the root does an HTTP redirect to www, then www CNAMEs over to github. The redirect step loses the URL path fragment, due to the redirector they're using.\n\nWe can solve this by changing DNS providers. I have another provider that has a more thorough redirector and I've tested that this works there. Is it worth the trouble?\n",
