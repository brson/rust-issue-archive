    "body": "I've been doing some thinking about this, and I've been writing code at such a slow pace that I don't have it in a repository just yet, but there are a number of ways that Rust language features would make the API differ from a Java implementation:\n- Date and time formatters could be built using a macro, and have their syntax checked at compile time, similar to the `format` or `regex` macros. Then they can be used to parse and format dates without having to worry about invalid formatting. (Coincidentally, I had a bug only yesterday at work that was caused by me using `y` instead of `Y` in the string and assuming it was correct... bad move)\n- Durations and Periods could be moved into the same enum, with both constructors for an exact number of milliseconds and ones for periods such as Days or Months. We wouldn't need methods such as `addHours` or `addMinutes` when we could instead provide an `Add` implementation on Instant and Duration, and could write something like `Time::now() + Hours(3)`.\n  (I'm not sure about [`3.hours()`](https://github.com/wycats/rust-activesupport/blob/master/dsl.rs), but it's certainly possible.)\n- A Chronology looks like it could be a typeclass, with `to_instant` and `from_instant` methods that convert between Instants and a number of milliseconds since an epoch. These values could then be converted to LocalDateTime structs in much the same way as Joda.\n\nI'm currently waiting on a date/time crate for my personal project, which was why I started thinking about this, so I'd be happy to contribute to whatever comes up.\n",
