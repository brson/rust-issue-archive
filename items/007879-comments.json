Thus, the containing package here doesn't show up in workcache as \"already built\". If I cached each _crate_ as a single entity with inputs and outputs, I think this example would work without having to build a dependency graph. (Building a dependency graph would be more declarative, and workcache is supposed to work imperatively, which occurred to me later.)\n",
