All sorts of interesting things that we have not foreseen could be built on top of it outside of `std`. (Like maybe finding the line number of the current iterator position for error reporting in an interator-based parser with `subslice_offset`. But whether that specific example makes sense is besides the point.)\n\nIf this method is removed without a replacement, there is no way to get at the full information that is carried by `slice::Iter`. (Without crazy-unsafe transmutes or pointer offseting that guess the struct layout.)\n\nOn the other hand, what\u2019s the cost of keeping it? Are there issues with it?\n",

    "body": "Where these functions would be extremely useful is for strings, but I don't see them there.\n\nBasically many string operations require `&str`, but other are much easier on iterators. Not being able to convert between those representations means a lot of duplicate information needs to be kept and one often needs to resort to `char_indices`, which is a bit unwieldy. Moreover, often the slice from start to iterator/subslice is needed, e.g. to be passed to `std::str::FromStr::from_str`. This could be built from `as_slice` for `Chars` and `subslice_index`, but a special function would have the advantage that it could skip the `is_char_boundary` check, because the slice/iterator were (unless unsafe was used) checked.\n",
