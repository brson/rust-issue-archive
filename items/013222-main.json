This is designed to work with the DXR code browser, but is frontend-independent, that is this info should be useful for all kinds of code browsers, IDEs, or other tools.\n\nI need to squash commits before landing (there will probably be a fair few to come), please ignore them for now and just comment on the changes.\n",
