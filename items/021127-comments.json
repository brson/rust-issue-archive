    "body": "To go into some more detail about why I made this change, I was testing pretty printing a structure with 10 fields with associated types with `#[derive(PartialEq)]`, and `print_expr` with no optimizations according to lldb was taking up 28KB of stack space. This caused my printer to run out of stack space. It seems that breaking up that function into multiple functions was sufficient to cut down on the stack usage sufficient for my code to run successfully.\n",
