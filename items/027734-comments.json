I believe that adding a lifetime parameter would be backwards-incompatible now, so that's probably out of the question. Beyond that though, it sounds like you think the wording around the documentation should be tweaked, and perhaps another piece of information could be added along the lines of \"this is the byte where something bad happened\"? Or perhaps also a \"skip to this position to keep decoding\" kinda position?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts!\n",

    "body": "Alright, this: https://github.com/SimonSapin/rust-utf8/blob/d5192ce94e/lib.rs#L72-L300 has all the UTF-8 decoding functionality I\u2019d like to have while being as flexible as possible in terms of how the data flows. The downside is that it\u2019s quite a bit of API surface, and users need some amount of boilerplate code. (`StrChar` in particular is a micro-optimization. `char` could be used instead, but it\u2019d have to be converted from UTF-8 to UTF-32 only (most likely) to be converted back to UTF-8 again.)\n\nTrying to cram all that info in `Utf8Error` doesn\u2019t sound nice. The current API has lots of surface, but I haven\u2019t managed to reduce it while maintaining flexibility. (E.g. not require that all input byte slices have the same lifetime.) Any suggestion?\n\n`PushLossyDecoder` above in the same file is slightly more convenient API where the user \u201cpushes\u201d bytes into the decoder which in turns pushes `&str` slices somewhere else. Compare with the data flow of iterator adaptors where the users \u201cpulls\u201d data from `Iterator::next` which in turn pulls from another iterator.\n\nThe `tests` directory also has re-implementations of `std::str::from_utf8` and `String::from_utf8_lossy`.\n",

    "body": "Wow, thanks for doing that @SimonSapin! It does seem like that level of detail may want to belong outside of std rather than in, but I'm curious if we could perhaps contain at least some of the information? Would there be a way that some UTF-8 decoding would be necessary downstream but we could allow doing the \"easy thing\" of replacing with the replacement character on the fly? For example with `DecodeStepStatus::Error` is there a way to know where to start next after emitting a replacement character?\n",

    "body": "Yeah, since this crate duplicates most of its logic with code in libcore and libcollections I felt that moving into core would help reduce duplication, and I like the idea of re-implementing \"higher level\" existing functions on top of it. But given the complexity of the API you\u2019re probably right that this is better in an external library.\n\n> Would there be a way that some UTF-8 decoding would be necessary downstream but we could allow doing the \"easy thing\" of replacing with the replacement character on the fly?\n\nI don\u2019t understand this part, sorry.\n\nExtrapolating a bit: yes, there are many ways the API can be simplified if you make some assumptions about how its used. For example, if you assume lossy decoding, `\"\\u{FFFD}\"` (a `&'static str` coerced to `&'a str`) can be returned the same as a \"normal\" decoded `str` slice, so errors don\u2019t need to exist in the API at all.\n\nBut the whole idea here is to make it as general as possible with no assumption. Then more specialized things like `PushLossyDecoder` can be built on top.\n\n> For example with DecodeStepStatus::Error is there a way to know where to start next after emitting a replacement character?\n\n`DecodeStepStatus::Error` has a `remaining_input_after_error` field for exactly this :) Use that as the parameter to `decode_step` in the next iteration of a loop.\n",

    "body": "On the subject of `<String as FromStr>::ParseError` potentially being a void type, I've found some value in doing that in `conv`.  Specifically, there's a single `enum NoError {}` type that implements `Error`.  This is leveraged by an `UnwrapOk` extension trait implemented `for<T> Result<T, NoError>` to provide an `unwrap_ok` method that is basically `unwrap`, but cannot panic.  As such, it doesn't need landing pads _and_ specifically indicates that the unwrap in this case is effectively a no-op (and not a code smell like a regular `unwrap` call).\n\nIt's probably outside the scope of this issue, but it might be useful to have a similar, standard `NoError` type in Rust.\n",
