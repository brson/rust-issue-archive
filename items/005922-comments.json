    "body": "To expand on my previous comment, which was quite terse -- \n\nI see four options:\n\n**Option 1.** Leave things as they are. This means that unused lifetime parameters are a bit of a footgun, because people seem to expect them to behave in a contravariant fashion (as described by @thestinger and in #10703).\n\n**Option 2.** If inference finds that a lifetime parameter is bivariant (effectively, unused), default to contravariant, which seems to be what people expect. This means that a lifetime \"can only get shorter\", much like the lifetime `'a` in the type `&'a Foo`. I am a bit nervous about this in that there is an undocumented assumption -- that the lifetime parameter will behave a certain way -- that can easily be changed.\n\nFor example, if I have `struct Foo<'a> { x: int }` and then I change this to `struct Foo<'a> { x: int, y: fn() -> &'a int }` then `Foo` goes from being contravariant with respect to `'a` to covariant. This is of course always a danger in inference but somehow it seems dangerous to me that adding additional fields can \"flip\" the role of a lifetime parameter in this way. I guess it's because it is clear that the user had some kind of role in mind for that lifetime parameter that was represented by the field `x` but the type checker is not aware of that role -- e.g., the parameter `'a` was supposed to be the lifetime of the array that `x` is an index into or something. This means that the field `x` \"wants\" `'a` to be contravariant but the type checker doesn't know it. What's scary to me is that the inference will get the desired result _up until_ an additional use `'a` is added -- at that point, it should be generated invariant, but it will generate covariant instead.\n\n**Option 3.** Report an error for bivariant lifetime parameters. This is unfortunate in that one can imagine legitimately wanting a bivariant lifetime parameter in some unusual cases. (The same is true of the previous case)\n\n**Option 4.** Add the ability to specify variance explicitly, and then report an error for bivariant lifetime parameters. This seems reasonable but requires people to know what \"variance\" means. I imagine a syntax like `+'a` (covariant), `-'a` (contravariant), `='a` (invariant), and `*'a` (bivariant).\n\nAll of this applies equally to type parameters, incidentally. \n",

Is it merely an error to _instantiate_ a bivariant parameter?\n\nIt is not clear to me what the value is of having an explicit syntax for an erroneous construct.\n\nUpdate from IRC: niko clarified that the error would be (I think) from _inferring_ bivariant lifetime parameter.  But an explicitly specified bivariant parameter would be allowed.\n",

It seems we just add `#[lang = \"borrowed\"] struct Borrowed<'a>;` to the standard library and types wanting a lifetime bound without including a 1-word pointer field could use it.\n\nThe vector iterator uses raw pointers because the end pointer points one-past-the-end of the vector and the current pointer will end up being equal to `end` when it's finished. Since privacy can be broken via reflection, maintaining safety requires using raw pointers. I can think of other solutions to this involving only changes to how reflection works.\n",

People will expect the type system to be giving them guarantees it's not and it's surprising. I might be in favor of rendering bivariance illegal combined with lang items as you describe, but that is pretty close to option 4 (explicit annotation). Variance annotations are not especially complex on the compiler side. Whether it presents a simpler face to the end user is I guess the question -- lang items are bit more obscure somehow.

I don't think most users are likely to hit this in practice, because most users aren't going to be adding bivariant lifetime parameters to their types (from what I've seen people generally only add lifetime parameters when the compiler yells at them for not having one). Making inferred bivariant parameters illegal and providing a way to explicitly annotate each parameter, while certainly more complex from a syntactical perspective, is also the clearest and least surprising approach.\n\nIncidentally, what's the benefit to allowing explicit bivariant parameters?\n",

A type `Foo<T>` where `T` is affine, non-Send or non-Freeze may or may not have those properties itself.\n",

I'm worried, though, that there may be cases where someone wants a covariant type parameter without using it in a way that allows covariance to be inferred, if we default to contravariance. For example, FFI bindings may want to use covariant lifetime parameters to enforce restrictions that otherwise can't be inferred (because under the hood they use `*`).\n",

    "body": "I don't have a solid opinion about which option is best, but I share @thestinger's concern about syntax. Pointers and lifetimes are cryptic enough already. If we go with 4 I think the variance annotations should be somewhat longer-form.  I think that in general, the rule of thumb should be that verbosity is inversely proportional to ubiquity. If something is used all over the place you're likely to be aware of its meaning, and want it to be compact. If something is used rarely (as here) you don't mind if it's a bit longer, and since you quite possibly haven't ever seen it before, you benefit from it being self-descriptive.\n\nJust spelling out `covariant`, `contraviant`, `invariant`, and `bivariant` would already be much better than single-character sigils. Maybe there's something even nicer, I dunno.\n",
