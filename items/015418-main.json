  "body": "In my informal measurements, this brings the peak memory usage when\nbuilding librustc from 1662M down to 1502M.  Since 1662 - 1502 = 160,\nthis may not recover the entirety of the observed memory regression\n(250M) from PR #14604.  (However, according to my local measurements,\nthe regression when building librustc was more like 209M, so perhaps\nthis will still recover the lions share of the lost memory.)\n",
