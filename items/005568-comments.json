Unfortunately, `find_or_insert_with` and `insert_or_update_with` can't quite be implemented in terms of each other.  The options for this as far as I can tell are:\n- Implementing default methods for one of these inefficiently so it has to find the key twice.  (Obviously the maps in std would override both anyway.)\n- Not having a default method for both of these so that there are 2 basic insert-like methods that implementations would be forced to provide.\n- Adding another most general insert-like method. (Something like `insert_with_or_update_with` but hopefully with a less cumbersome name.)\n\nAny preferences between those or other suggestions?\n",

    "body": "First, sorry for saying I was going to do this and sitting on it for so long.  I keep meaning to make time to try to help out with rust but getting busy with other things.  I still plan to try to get this done.\n\nHow about changing `find_or_insert_with` to return `(&'a K, &'a mut V)` instead of just `&'a mut V`?  It seems like there should be some sort of insert operation where you remember what the key was afterwards, anyway.  If we did that, it would mean you could implement `insert_or_update_with` like so:\n\n```\nfn insert_or_update_with<'a>(&'a mut self, k: K, v: V,\n                             f: &fn(&K, &mut V)) -> &'a mut V {\n    let cell = Cell::new(v);\n    let (k, v) = self.find_or_insert_with(k, |_| cell.take());\n    if !cell.is_empty() {\n        f(k, v);\n    }\n    v\n}\n```\n\nThat seems nicer than `mangle` to me.  I think `mangle` is a little clunky and poorly named, FWIW.  Up to you guys though.\n",

You can't just make a recursive call and then call `skew` and `split` like the current insert does because this insert returns an internal pointer, so the current node stays mutably borrowed and you can't mutably borrow again it to balance the tree.

    "body": "IMHO, it's not possible to do that with safe code without doing an insert and then a find (i.e. with 2 searches). Then, skew and split move the children, so the reference should be valid. The only way I can see to do that with a search is with unsafe code:\n\n``` rust\nfn insert_or_update_with<'a, K: TotalOrd, V>(\n    node: &'a mut Option<~TreeNode<K, V>>,\n    key: K, value: V,\n    f: &fn(&K, &mut V)) -> &'a mut V {\n    match *node {\n      Some(ref mut save) => {\n        match key.cmp(&save.key) {\n          Less => {\n            let res: *mut V = unsafe {\n              transmute(insert_or_update_with(&mut save.left, key, value, f))\n            };\n            skew(save);\n            split(save);\n            unsafe{transmute(res)}\n          }\n          Greater => {\n            let res: *mut V = unsafe {\n              transmute(insert_or_update_with(&mut save.right, key, value, f))\n            };\n            skew(save);\n            split(save);\n            unsafe{transmute(res)}\n          }\n          Equal => {\n            save.key = key;\n            f(&save.key, &mut save.value);\n            &mut save.value\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      None => {\n       *node = Some(~TreeNode::new(key, value));\n        &mut node.get_mut_ref().value\n      }\n    }    \n}\n```\n\nIt compiles, but I didn't try running it and that's the first time I write unsafe code. And that's quite sad to have TreeMap using unsafe code.\n\nI hope I'm wrong and there is another solution.\n",

The key gets moved into the map and if you tried to keep a reference while you rebalanced the key, you'd run into exactly the same issue.  My implementation uses `transmute_mut_region` instead of `transmute` to be a little more specific about how it's being unsafe but is basically the same and it seems to work.  Thanks for the help!

    "body": "@davidhalperin Ah, NOW I think I see your point. Yes, without the ability to clone the key, it does leave us in a bit of a pickle, doesn't it? You can't do the find after the insert because the key is moved; you can't return a pointer to the key because it would prolong the loan on the map (and rightly so).\n\nIf were insistent on avoiding unsafe code, I imagine we could have some `insert`-like helper that takes an optional vector in which the path to the node can be encoded:\n\n```\nenum Path { Left, Right };\n\nfn find_or_insert_with(key: K, value: V, ...) -> &'mut V {\n    let mut path = ~[];\n    self.insert_helper(key, value, &mut path);\n    self.find_from_path(path)\n}\n\nfn insert_helper(key: K, value: V, ..., path: &mut ~[Path]) {\n    ...\n    if should insert on left left {\n        path.push(Left);\n        self.left.insert_helper(key, value, ...);\n    } else { ... }\n}\n\nfn find_from_path(&mut self, path: &[Path]) -> &'a mut V {\n    if path.is_empty() { return &mut self.value; }\n    match path[0] {\n        Left => self.left.find_from_path(path.slice_from(1)),\n        Right => ...    \n    }\n}\n```\n\nObviously this is a bit over the top, though out of idle curiosity I do wonder if you could encode the path in a u64 and a uint -- probably not, depends I guess on the balancing guarantees. :)\n",

    "body": "This isn't quite a dupe of that RFC because it doesn't mention the `Map` trait specifically (which this issue is referring to), but I think this is best covered by https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/235 now, so I'm going to close this in favor of that. Note that https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/235 recommends removing all collections traits, which would make this issue moot.\n",
