Or are you foreseeing some other benefit of `Box<[T]>` that is not captured by aggressive use of the `shrink_to_fit` method?\n\nI mention this because adding `shrink_to_fit` calls (though admittedly _not_ as aggressively as I could have), was the first thing I tried, and that did not seem to help very much.  this is what led to @pcwalton  and I [discussing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/14604#issuecomment-47983521) whether the cause was due to \"malloc slop\" (i.e. overhead from simply having several distinct malloc'ed blocks of memory and the fragmentation and/or metadata associated with those blocks, versus folding the distinct blocks together into one contiguous chunk.)\n",
