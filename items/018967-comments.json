There's an [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18000) for this concern in particular, although @thestinger doesn't give detailed arguments there.\n\nIt seems like it might be worth having a broader debate about this question, since the original RFC didn't specify a semantics here. I would certainly be willing to file an amendment to the RFC to kick off the discussion; @thestinger, it would be helpful if you could lay out in more detail the tradeoffs as you see them.\n",

This is not ideal from a performance standpoint though.\n\nOh and this requires to register from a dynamic library something that runs before all C++ global destructors in the process, and probably before all atexit handlers as well, which I have no idea how feasible it is.\n\nOr give up and say that C++ libraries with global objects cannot be safely bound to from Rust.\n",

C++ library defines a C++ global object that is not modified after initialization and thus thread-safe and exports a C API that queries it, which Rust binds to\n2. The main C executable creates a thread that calls a Rust function that has a loop that in every iteration uses the binding to call the C API in the library above which accesses the C++ global object\n3. The main C executable's main() returns, which causes the C++ global object to be destroyed\n4. The C-created thread is still running the loop in Rust code with calls the safe Rust-bound C API and accesses the C++ global object and crashes\n\nI guess this is an issue in all versions of Rust, btw.\n",

    "body": "@bill-myers: C++11 standardized detached threads and code is expected to use them. C++ libraries are responsible for being safe in a world where detached threads are used. These issues were considered during the C++11 development process. A model without detached threads was considered, but ultimately they chose to handle the problem in other ways and made detached threads the _default_ despite that forcing a wrapper around `std::thread` to use use joined threads correctly.\n\nI don't really see why any of this would be Rust's responsibility, considering that C++ has full support for detached threads and even _prefers_ them. Proposals [just like what you are suggesting](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2880.html) were _explicitly rejected_ in their standardization process.\n",
