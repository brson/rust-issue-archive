  "body": "I'll flip this on after doing a snapshot. This syntax may or may not\nstay around, and managed boxes are currently not very useful. They have\nthe same overall performance characteristics as `std::rc::Rc`, but are\nsignificantly slower, allocate larger boxes and hold onto the memory\nbeyond when it is needed due to lacking move semantics.\n\nThere are currently two useful aspects of the type:\n- the dereference sugar, which we should implement for `Rc`\n- the annihilator freeing cycles at the end of the task\n",
