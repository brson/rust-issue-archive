  "body": "The std::run module is a relic from a standard library long since past, and\nthere's not much use to having two modules to execute processes with where one\nis slightly more convenient. This commit merges the two modules, moving lots of\nfunctionality from std::run into std::io::process and then deleting\nstd::run.\n\nNew things you can find in std::io::process are:\n- Process::new() now only takes prog/args\n- Process::configure() takes a ProcessConfig\n- Process::status() is the same as run::process_status\n- Process::output() is the same as run::process_output\n- I/O for spawned tasks is now defaulted to captured in pipes instead of ignored\n- Process::kill() was added (plus an associated green/native implementation)\n- Process::wait_with_output() is the same as the old finish_with_output()\n- destroy() is now signal_exit()\n- force_destroy() is now signal_kill()\n\nCloses #2625\nCloses #10016\n",
