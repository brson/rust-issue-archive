    "body": "Yeah unfortunately this strategy will have dependency problems with libcore (as libcore is the base of the chain), so this may not work out so well. For now, though, I'd encourage discussion for this API to happen on the internals thread started by @richo: http://internals.rust-lang.org/t/stabilising-formatter-flags/1927\n\nFor now I'm going to close this in favor of that thread (as well as the associated issue). Thanks regardless for the PR though!\n",
