    "body": "I personally think we should just follow haskell's lead and omit the docs from traits (I'm happy to differ from haddock and keep the individual method signatures displayed still, and to show any explicit docs on the impl'd methods).\n\nThe docs from the trait are not specific to the current leading to confusion (depending on the wording, as this issue shows), and are, in many cases, just useless filler (why does one need to navigate around the same doc comment for `Clone::clone` on nearly every type definition page?).\n\nThe trait definition are clickable, so a user can easily navigate to the trait to see the docs there, if necessary.\n",
