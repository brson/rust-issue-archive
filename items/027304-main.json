  "body": "This reverts commit a0efd3a3d99a98e3399a4f07abe6a67cf0660335.\n\nThis commit caused a lot of unintended breakage for many Cargo builds. The problem is that Cargo compiles build scripts with `-C prefer-dynamic`, so the standard library is always dynamically linked and hence any imports need to be marked with `dllimport`. Dependencies of build scripts, however, were compiled as rlibs and did not have their imports tagged with `dllimport`, so build scripts would fail to link.\n\nWhile known that this situation would break, it was unknown that it was a common scenario in the wild. As a result I'm just reverting these heuristics for now.\n",
