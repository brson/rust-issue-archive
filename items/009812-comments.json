This seems like some that's tricky to get right, so I'm wary of adding this sort of functionality without an ability to prevent it regressing. Could you also add some tests with unicode filenames and such to make sure that these apis properly work? The time zone problem may be tough to test, but it would be great if we were able to get it testable as well.\n",
