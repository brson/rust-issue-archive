Essentially, all I/O in core is going to need two modes of operation - one using the native blocking APIs and one defering to the scheduler event loop.\n",

Maybe we could call these input_fd or something.\n\nNo problem. I will push a new commit.\n\n> Is there a reason input is represented as a c_int (presumably an fd) and the others are a *FILE.\n\nI don't really know (I didn't make that decision originally), but I can see a couple of things that might go someway to explaining it:\n- they (the std io handles) couldn't all be file descriptors (without changing `core::io`) because there is a `io::fd_writer` but no `io::fd_reader`.\n- they couldn't all be `*libc::FILE` because `os::fdopen` hard codes the \"r\" mode.\n\nI am also going to push a commit to fix the test that failed on OS X.\n",
