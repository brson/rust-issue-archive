    "body": "This may also only manifest with @elliottslaughter's newer llvm build, since I haven't seen it.\n\nNote that there are currently two significantly different codepaths for emitting intrinsics: one for those with type parameters and one without. The `frame_address` intrinsic is the only intrinsic without type parameters, so it's worth investigating whether this affects all intrinsics or just some.\n\nI have previously suspected that this problem also exists for all natives, that we name the wrapper for bar in `native mod foo { fn bar(); }` without including the native module portion of the path. If that's true I would also expect the following to be wonky:\n\n```\nnative mod rustrt {\n    fn rust_dbg_test();\n}\n\nfn rust_dbg_test() { }\n```\n",
