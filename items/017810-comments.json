    "body": "I do not really have a reduced testcase, though, somehow, I was able to work around the ICE on this commit: https://github.com/sebcrozet/ncollide/commit/4f744e66da8bb9d22ab349817dd94918466aecf3\n\nWhat I did is to remove explicit calls to `.deref_mut()` and explicitely dereference anything that had the type `Rc<RefCell<Foo>>` or `&Rc<RefCell<Foo>>` before I call `.borrow_mut()`. For example, if `l` has the type `&mut Rc<RefCell<Foo>>`, I changed `l.borrow_mut().deref_mut().some_field` to `(**l).borrow_mut().some_field`.\n\nNote thit this fix is done on `ncollide`. The ICE seems to happend only when `ncollide` is used by another library/binary (and not during the compilation of `ncollide` itself).\n",
