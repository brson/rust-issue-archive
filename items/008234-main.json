  "body": "This fixes 4 bugs that prevented the extra::arc and extra::sync tests from passing on the new runtime.\n- In `Add SendDeferred trait` I add a non-rescheduling `send_deferred` method to our various channel types. The `extra::sync` concurrency primitives need this guarantee so they can send while inside of an exclusive. (This fixes deterministic deadlocks seen with `RUST_THREADS=1`.)\n- In \"Fix nasty double-free bug\" I make sure that a `ChanOne` suppresses_finalize _before_ rescheduling away to the receiver, so in case it gets a kill signal upon coming back, the destructor is inhibited as desired. (This is pretty uncommon on multiple CPUs but showed up always with `RUST_THREADS=1`.)\n- In `Fix embarrassing bug where 'unkillable' would unwind improperly` I make sure the task's unkillable counter stays consistent when a kill signal is received right at the start of an unkillable section. (This is a very uncommon race and can only occur with multiple CPUs.)\n- In `Don't fail from kill signals if already unwinding` I do pretty much what it says on the tin. Surprising that it took the whole suite of sync/arc tests to expose this.\n\nThe other two commits are cleanup.\n\nr @brson\n",
