    "body": "Suggestions:\n- Don't expose `ChaChaRng` through a `std::` module. Some systems need to ensure that any cryptographic algorithm in use is certified, and making `ChaChaRng` part of the standard library would be counterproductive for them.\n- Similar to how we can override allocators, provide a way to override the CSPRNG so that (a) the application can swap in a CSRNG that is known to be good according to its standards (see previous item), and (b) so that the applicaiton can swap in a CSPRNG that takes advantage of special knowledge the application has. For example, If the application is only going to be deployed on systems that have the `getrandom` syscall, then the application may wish to swap in an implementation that avoids the `/dev/urandom` fallback completely. This is especially the case for an application that wants to use seccomp-bpf to prevent the use of `open`/`read`/etc.\n- Provide a mechanism separate from the `Rng` trait to fill a slice with (secure) random bytes. The `Rng` trait is very badly designed as it mixes all kinds of concerns that most applications don't have. This mixing causes trouble for some applications. For example, `Rng` has `next_f32` and `next_f64` methods, which means that it cannot be fully implemented on any system that does not have floating point support and/or which wants to avoid linking in the floating point libraries. This in turn means that such applications cannot use `OsRng`.\n\nObviously, I am biased, but I think a better API for a CSPRNG is the very simple one in _ring_: https://briansmith.org/rustdoc/ring/rand/index.html. This type of interface is sufficient for every use of a CSPRNG I've ever needed. Note that an implementation of an interface like `Rng` such as `OsRng` can easily be built on top of such an interface.\n",

    "body": "> However, it is also the case that some implementations may experience errors that they cannot avoid, so it may be worth allowing an implementation to panic or abort the process if it has no other choice on failure.\n> That\u2019s Result::unwrap, right?\n\nI'm assuming that the `fill` function is changed to return a `Result<(), ()>`. I'm saying that some implementations of `fill` might not be able to return `Err(())` on failure because the function that they are implemented on top of calls `abort` on failure. For example, that would be the case if one used BoringSSL's `RAND_bytes` and an error occurred inside `RAND_bytes`. (This isn't a concern in _ring_, though.) It's still a good idea to have it return `Result<(), ()>` but this is something to consider.\n",

It would be nice to have an `InfallibleRandom` trait as well, where there is a `fn fill_infallible` or similar with no return value (e.g. always succeeds).\n",

    "body": "I agree with @briansmith that `OsRng` should be brought up to cryptographic standards. \r\n\r\nAbove that, there are as more users who care about the performance of `rand`'s distributions, `Rng` methods, etc. than about them being constant time.  To be clear, _I_ actually do want even a constant-time Ziggurat algorithm, but _very_ few cryptographic applications need that. \r\n\r\nI'd suggest we clearly warn about the side channel vulnerabilities the `Rng` trait itself, but keep it performance focused.  An external `ct-rand` crate could reimplement the remaining functionality of `rand` in constant time via a wrapper `struct CTRng<R: Rng>(R)` with an `impl<R: Rng> Rng for CTRng<R> { .. }` that provide constant time reimplementations of all default methods and new constant time distributions.\r\n\r\nWe should remove functionality from `Rng` that simply cannot be provided in constant time of course.  I believe specialization should permit this `CTRng<R>` wrapper to be optimized for specific `R: Rng` though, so maybe everything will be okay if we simply put in the work.  It's fine if the `CTRng<R>` wrapper comes with some warning that using an arbitrary `R: Rng` might fail to produce constant time code, and recommends only using the specialized choices for `R`.",
