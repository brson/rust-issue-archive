For new code, certainly, use `\"foo\".to_string()`, that is the idiomatically correct approach. But there's no convincing win to modifying existing uses of `String::from_str()` at this time.\n\nThank you for your contribution, and I'm looking forward to whatever else you submit. I'm closing this PR at this time for the already-discussed reasons. Once `\"foo\".to_string()` becomes fast again, I would encourage you to consider re-submitting.\n",
