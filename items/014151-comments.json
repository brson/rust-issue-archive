    "body": "The fast path is currently far too large for inlining it to work out well. The function call itself is a small part of the cost. It needs to handle a lot of special cases like coping with thread-local data destructors. It might make sense to poke some holes in the API based on guarantees on the Rust end, but I think we should deal with the lower-hanging fruit before considering that. I think there's at least 20-30% more to gain inside jemalloc itself from thread cache improvements.\n",
