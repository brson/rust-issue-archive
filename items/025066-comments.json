    "body": "I think this issue is more appropriate for the RFC repo as it sounds like you're interested in expanding the core `Read`/`Write` traits (it's highly unlikely to special-case `TcpStream` here. Could you open an issue over there instead?\n\n> Also, an API like http://golang.org/pkg/bufio/ would be nice. (For buffered reading of lines, etc)\n\nNote that many of these niceties are provided by the `BufRead` trait, you just must explicitly create a buffered reader/writer.\n",
