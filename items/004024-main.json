  "body": "This actually breaks the build presently, due to something _very strange_ associated with the Eq trait. Might need a snap? I don't get it, and will need help from @pcwalton diagnosing. Meanwhile comments / r+ appreciated. I just wanted to get a sketch landed so we could concentrate efforts. Note it has no caching logic yet, just moving-stuff-around and calling-thunks. Still takes some doing.\n\nr? @brson, @erickt or @pcwalton\n",
