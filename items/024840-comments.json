    "body": "@SimonSapin i think this may be \"by design\", according to discussion on #24205 and #17665.  Although then again it is not clear that there was consensus on #17665 that `--enable-debug` should imply `--disable-optimize` (though my reading of the comments there that at least _some_ of the participants were in favor of it having that effect).\n\nThe intention, as I understand it, is that if you do `--enable-debug`, then you want an \"ideal\" environment for debugging, which for some people implies \"do not let LLVM optimizations get in the way of my debugging experience.\"\n\nThe problem with this reasoning is that bootstrapping `rustc` takes an absurdly long time with `--disable-optimize`.  So in practice I do not see how one could realistically actually use `--enable-debug` without also including `--enable-optimize` to override what it is doing today.\n\n(At this point I essentially always call `configure` via a driver script that passes explicit switches based on local filesystem context.)\n\n---\n\nAnyway, _I_ would not object if we went back and again decoupled the `--enable/disable-optimize` configure setting from the `--enable/disable-debug` configure setting.\n\n(The argument for why `--enable-debug` \"should\" imply `--disable-optimize`, as noted in the relevant [weekly meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/weekly-meetings/2014-10-07.md#releasedebug-configure-flags), was that 2-3 flags for configure the build is too many, and therefore we wanted to identify two \"modes\": release mode and developer mode, and then choosing your mode via `configure` would yield the \"ideal\" experience for that mode.  This all sounds fine, but I clearly take issue with the claim that `--disable-optimize` is part of anyone's ideal developer mode.)\n",

I assume logging is disabled on my Rust build\n- I decide to try making another build where they\u2019re enabled.\n- I look at `./configure --help`. `--enable-debug` seems relevant, it probably enables logging.\n- I note that `--disable-optimize` is listed as an option, but `--enable-optimize` is not. I assume this means my build will be optimized. This is what I want.\n- The build is taking a while. I know Rust takes a long time to bootstrap and all, but this seems longer than usual. I go do something else.\n- The build ended up taking just over 4 hours.\n- I start building Servo with this new rustc. Cargo somehow decide to rebuild everything, even though I was careful to pick the same Rust commit. This takes another 2 hours, instead of the usual ~8 minutes.\n- Every rebuild of just Servo\u2019s script crate (where the ICE is triggered) now takes over 50 minutes instead of ~2.\n",
