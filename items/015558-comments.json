    "body": "The main observable error here is that `install.sh` fails to print out alex's message about it being necessary to add a path to one's `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (since the first attempt on the pre-existing `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` succeeded, but only because the current-working-directory misled it).\n\nI think we can easily make the check in `install.sh` more robust.  One strategy I thought of this morning: instead of running the runability check from the root of the distribution (aka the build tree when one is using `make install`), instead of that, make a fresh empty subdirectory in the current directory, and then `cd` into that before each `rustc` runnabiilty check.  That way, as long as the embedded path does not do anything funny like have relative references to the parent directory via `../path/to/libs/`, then that should be able to run consistently in both the build tree and also in an untarred release.\n\n---\n\nI was a little perturbed at the nature of the path that was embedded in the rustc being distributed, since it seemed to embed build artifacts unrelated to the target prefix.  So it might be nice to see if that can be changed.  But that is not strictly speaking the goal of this ticket.\n",
