    "body": "r+ (deliberately did not put on the commit)\n\nOnly thing is that I think we should rename `ScopeData`, which to me suggests \"data about scopes\" and not \"a single scope\". On IRC @pnkfelix and I settled on `CodeRegion`; I'm happy with that or `RegionScope` or even `Extent`. \n\nI also think we should probably find a shorter way to go from a node-id to a `CodeRegion/RegionScope/Extent`, because `region::Foo::from_node_id(...)` is quite long. Directly importing the name would help, so at least one could write `Extent::from_node_id(...)`, or perhaps defining a free fn in `region`, so one could write `region::extent(node-id)`. I suspect many of these lines are > 100 characters (I see that travis is failing, haven't investigated, but I bet that is why).\n",
