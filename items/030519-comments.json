    "body": "I've decided that both the original and minified code ought NOT to compile. Both examples, as @arielb1 pointed out, only ever compiled due to a bug. However, it's possible that if we improved closure kind inference, the minified snippet perhaps COULD compile. Let me elaborate.\n\nThe high-level reason that this code is being rejected is because the outer closure might be called more than once -- in the original code, it most certainly is -- and each call borrows data from the environment and returns it. Those references could well overlap with one another -- and in the minified example, they certainly would, since the data being re-borrowed is just the same value `foo`.\n\nLet me give a more detailed look in terms of the minified example. First, let me define a few terms:\n\n```\n(|| let bar = &mut *foo; move |b| *bar = b) ;\n^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ enclosing statement\n ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    outer closure\n                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    inner closure\n```\n\nIntuitively, the inner closure (the one being returned), by capturing `bar`, requires a reference that lives as long as the enclosing statement. It must do so, because this closure is returned (and dropped) from there.\n\nHowever, the _outer closure_ does not move `foo`, it only borrows it. So this is an `FnMut` closure which can be called more than once. Therefore, it cannot lend out any references to `foo` that outlive its own closure body. So this code should not compile.\n\nIn terms of the closure desugaring, the outer closure contains no moves, and hence is an `FnMut` closure, so `&mut *foo` desugars to something like `&mut *(*self).foo`.  The lifetime of the resulting borrow must therefore be less than the lifetimes of _all_ the `&mut` borrows we must traverse along the way, which includes both `self` and `foo` here. And the lifetime of `self` is some anonymous lifetime not related to `foo`.\n\nTherefore, to make this particular code snippet compile, we really need an `FnOnce` closure. We can get this by removing `&mut *`, which will cause the `let bar = foo` to be a _move_ of `foo` and not a\nreborrow: http://is.gd/gWSJZ3. We can also do this by providing a \"hint\" to the inferencer http://is.gd/7MaUbv in the form of a function that requires an `FnOnce` closures. (Note that it is NOT\nenough to make this a `move` closure, since then it is still an `FnMut` closure, just one that takes ownership of `foo` rather than borrowing `foo`).\n\nThis is a bit of a corner case in the inference, actually. It is impossible to fix in general, but this particular example could be made to work, given a shift in strategy. Currently, we select whether a closure should be `Fn`, `FnMut`, or `FnOnce` based on two factors:\n1. When creating the closure, does the immediate context give us a hint of what it must be? If so, just use that. This is what happens here http://is.gd/7MaUbv.\n2. If not (which is the normal case), then look at what the closure _does_. We can only do this towards the very end of type-inference:\n   - Does it move any upvars? If so, must be `FnOnce`.\n   - Does it mutate any upvars? If so, must be `FnMut`.\n   - Else, can be `Fn`.\n\nBut in this case, the strategy of #2 is insufficient: this is because while it does not _move_ any upvars, it does _loan_ an upvar out for a duration that is longer than the closure call itself. This also requires an `FnOnce`. But we don't know how long the loans will last at the time when we are deciding what kind of closure we need (and we can't know that) -- region inference has not run, and to run region inference, we have to know what kind of closures we have!\n\nStill, it's plausible we could determine that the closure is only ever called once (or, in this case, not ever), and use THAT information to select `FnOnce`. I'm not sure what this would affect beyond this minified example, but I guess I can think of some cases. It certainly wouldn't affect the original code snippet.\n",
