  "body": "This adds a priority queue implemented as a binary heap to std. The API is heavily inspired by python's heapq module except that it's encapsulated in a container and uses a max-heap to get the default of high values as the max priority and sorting in ascending order.\n\nThe naming (priority_queue::PriorityQueue) is quite verbose, so it could be heapq::HeapQ instead if that's preferred.\n",
