Assuming that `typeof` used as the return type would have a method's `self` in scope, you could write:\n\n```\nstruct Foo { x: ~[int] }\n\nimpl Foo {\n    fn foo(&self) -> typeof(self.x.iter()) { self.x.iter() }\n}\n```\n\nIt would be uncomfortable enough for a human to write so it wouldn't get much use, but it'd be simple for a macro/syntax extension to duplicate the fn body into both the type and the actual fn body. \n",

    "body": "Adding `typeof` is in no way simpler than just inferring the return type in the first place. I agree that as types get more complicated, writing out the return type is sometimes unreasonable. There is no fundamental reason we cannot infer return types so long as the call graph in the file forms a DAG; it complicates type checking, in that the current two-phase structure no longer works. Rather, what we call `collect` and `check` must be intertwined. (We can even infer return types in the face of cycles in the call graph, but it gets more complicated, because we would need to use a single inference context for multiple fn items.) Still, it's not _that_ hard. Future efforts to parallelize would get more complicated but also not impossible; something like futures models the problem fairly well.\n",

    "body": "I suspect associated items could alleviate _some_ of these cases, though probably not all of them.\n\nE.g. instead of writing:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<'a>(v: &'a [int]) -> std::iter::Rev<std::vec::Items<'a, int>> {\n    v.iter().rev()\n}\n```\n\n(which require you have knowledge of the names of implementing structs within `std::vec` and also `std::iter`), with associated types you would instead write something like\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<'a>(v: &'a [int]) -> std::vec::Slice<'a, int>::Iter::Rev {\n    v.iter().rev()\n}\n```\n\nand in practice since you'll be `use`'ing the types you're working with, that's likely to be just:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<'a>(v: &'a [int]) -> Slice<'a, int>::Iter::Rev {\n    v.iter().rev()\n}\n```\n\nLike I said at the outset, it doesn't handle all cases cleanly (e.g. the `Chain` example still looks bad I think), but it would enable a step forward in terms of making it easy to write these signatures without much thought.  (And also write methods like `foo` in generic code since it does not need to encode the concrete iterator types.)\n\n---\n\nI actually suspect the ideal thing could be a hypothetical _statically-resolved_ existential syntax like \n\n``` rust\nfn foo<'a>(v: &'a [int]) -> <I:Iter> I {\n    v.iter().rev()\n}\n```\n\nthat is the dual to the universal parameterization syntax that one sees with `<I:Iter>` on the left-hand side of the `->`; in this case the compiler would enforce that clients of `foo` never used any methods on `I` except for those provided by the `Iter` interface, but the method dispatch would still be tied via monomorphization directly to the implementing methods provided by `I` itself, not dynamically dispatched the way you would see with a trait object like `~Iter`.  (It would still break ABI's, but at least you'd have some notion of source compatibility with the above interface.)\n\nBut no need to work on any of this until after 1.0 I think.\n",

I suppose my suggestion is indeed a kind of type-inference, though my mental model remains that of a statically-resolved existential (probably because I see the `<I:Iter>` as denoting either `forall` or `exists` depending on which side of the `->` arrow it is on.  In any case, I do find it interesting that none of the syntaxes on #11455 took the form of an existential with an explicitly bound name, which could be useful for doing constructions like:\n\n```\nfn bar<'a>(v: &'a [int]) -> <I:Iter> Option<I> { ... }\n```\n",

We _know_ the result of `f(n)` can only ever be the same type, so we _could_ allow it: in this case, it's better to think of it as inference. However, if we think of it as an existential, then we should assume that `f(n)` might branch on `n` and return different types for different inputs (even though, physically speaking, it cannot), and therefore we should reject the above.\n\nI've actually come around to prefer the latter: this means that from outside `f()`, it will behave exactly like an unboxed trait object, which is good for intuition and consistency. It's also the forwards-compatible choice: we can make it more permissive later if we choose to without breaking anything, but not vice versa.\n\n> In any case, I do find it interesting that none of the syntaxes on #11455 took the form of an existential with an explicitly bound name, which could be useful for doing constructions like:\n> \n> ```\n> fn bar<'a>(v: &'a [int]) -> <I:Iter> Option<I> { ... }\n> ```\n\nThis reads to me as a universal: `forall I: Iter. Option<I>`, not an existential. In Rust existentials are formed by omitting the name of a type and substituting the name of a trait. If we want to follow the analogy (and I think we should), then we should write simply `Option<Iter>`. (If, following the above, from outside of `bar()` the analogy `Iter : &Iter :: T : &T` is exact, then I think this \"abuse of notation\" is safe to introduce.)\n\nIncidentally:\n\n```\nfn bar<'a>(v: &'a [int]) -> Option<Iter> { ... }\n```\n\nThis happens to be incorrect as written, because information about the lifetime is lost in the result. Just as with boxed trait objects, you would have to write `-> Option<Iter: 'a>`.\n",

I realise the arguments against whole program inference, perhaps you could have this restricted to 'inline' or 'private' functions  if you're concerned about that, and of course the IDE issue of trying to compile incomplete code where the return type doesn't yet match up could be solved with compiler flags specific to that case.\n",
