  "body": "This commit performs another pass over the `std::char` module for stabilization.\nSome minor cleanup is performed such as migrating documentation from libcore to\nlibunicode (where the `std`-facing trait resides) as well as a slight\nreorganiation in libunicode itself. Otherwise, the stability modifications made\nare:\n- `char::from_digit` is now stable\n- `CharExt::is_digit` is now stable\n- `CharExt::to_digit` is now stable\n- `CharExt::to_{lower,upper}case` are now stable after being modified to return\n  an iterator over characters. While the implementation today has not changed\n  this should allow us to implement the full set of case conversions in unicode\n  where some characters can map to multiple when doing an upper or lower case\n  mapping.\n- `StrExt::to_{lower,upper}case` was added as unstable for a convenience of not\n  having to worry about characters expanding to more characters when you just\n  want the whole string to get into upper or lower case.\n\nThis is a breaking change due to the change in the signatures of the\n`CharExt::to_{upper,lower}case` methods. Code can be updated to use functions\nlike `flat_map` or `collect` to handle the difference.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nCloses #20333\n",
