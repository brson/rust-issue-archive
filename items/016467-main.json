  "body": "public, including in trait bounds and typedefs.\n\nThere are three main patterns that this breaks. First is code that uses\nprivate trait bounds in public APIs:\n\n```\npub mod a {\n    trait Trait { ... }\n    pub fn f<T:Trait>() { ... }\n}\n```\n\nChange that code to export the trait. For example:\n\n```\npub mod a {\n    pub trait Trait { ... }     // note `pub`\n    pub fn f<T:Trait>() { ... }\n}\n```\n\nSecond, this change breaks code that was relying on\n`#[allow(visible_private_types)]`. That lint is now a hard error, and\ncannot be overridden. For example:\n\n```\nmod helper {\n    pub struct Foo { ... }\n}\npub mod public {\n    use helper::Foo;\n    pub fn f() -> Foo;\n}\n```\n\nBecause there is no way for code that uses `public::f` to name `Foo`,\nthis is no longer allowed. Change affected code to look like this:\n\n```\npub mod helper {    // note `pub`\n    pub struct Foo { ... }\n}\npub mod public {\n    use helper::Foo;\n    pub fn f() -> Foo;\n}\n```\n\nThird, this change breaks code that was relying on being able to\nreference private typedefs in public APIs. For example:\n\n```\npub mod b {\n    type Foo = int;\n    pub fn f(_: Foo) { ... }\n}\n```\n\nChange this code to:\n\n```\npub mod b {\n    pub type Foo = int; // note `pub`\n    pub fn f(_: Foo) { ... }\n}\n```\n\nThis implements RFC #48.\n\nCloses #16463.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nr? @alexcrichton\n",
