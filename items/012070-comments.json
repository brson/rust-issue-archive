    "body": "Hm, it appears that this doesn't seem to be that useful on linux at all. From what I can tell, `dladdr` only consults the dynamic symbol table, whereas most of our symbols are considered being in the local symbol table. I am unable to find anything which consults the local symbol table instead of the dynamic symbol table, and otherwise fixing this would require us not flagging functions as `internal` to LLVM and then passing the `--export-dynamic` option to GCC (or maybe `-rdynamic`), which seems like overkill for backtraces.\n\nWith this in light, here's a summary of the backtrace methods that I know of:\n\n### `backtrace`\n\nThis didn't work well on OSX because it couldn't backtrace green threads. This also doesn't work well on linux because it can't print the names of all our `internal` functions.\n\n### `libgcc_s`\n\nWe depend on this library for unwinding, and it conveniently provides an api to trace the stack. This method proved much more reliable for `backtrace`, working in all situations. Sadly, all it gives us is IP addresses, nothing else. It's up to us to translate the address to a name, and the method of `dladdr` has the limitations laid out above.\n\n### `libunwind`\n\nTurns out using `libunwind` directly there's a `unw_get_proc_name` function which does exactly what we want. In my testing, it figured out the names of `static` C functions, and this translates to working for all our `internal` functions as well.\n\nThe problem with using `libunwind` is that I don't think we can rely on this being available on all systems. I had to install a package to get it on ubuntu, and even then I couldn't get the 32-bit version of libunwind. We could build it ourselves, but then we're having a new dependency for all programs (just for backtraces), so I'm not sure this solution will work out.\n\n### `readelf`\n\nWe know that `libgcc_s` + `dladdr` works except that it can't resolve all of our symbols. The return value from `dladdr` does give us a filename that the symbol comes from, plus we have the exact symbol of the address (thanks to `_Unwind_FindEnclosingFunction`). In theory we could just shell out to `readelf` (as suggested by [this stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18679567/alternative-to-backtrace-on-linux-that-can-find-symbols-for-static-functions)) and parse that output.\n\nThis relies on `readelf` being installed on the system, but that's pretty common for non-osx unixes I believe. This method is also super sketchy.\n\n### Moving forward\n\nI don't think that \"just using `dladdr`\" will cut it for non-osx unices. I actually think that the nicest way forward will be shelling out to `readelf`. This symbol problem is currently only an issue on platforms that predominately use ELF-format executables/objects, so I don't think there's too much of a problem there.\n\nWhat do others think about this approach?\n",
