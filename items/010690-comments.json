    "body": "This can be expanded by going into detail about how to mutate the list in-place by using a mutable reference, including an introduction to swaps. It can then introduce named lifetimes by demonstrating searching through the list and returning a reference to the value. It could introduce traits by implementing `Iterator`, with a `for` loop thrown in as a bonus. The list can be turned into a generic type, too.\n\nI think this is a much better way to teach the language than how we're doing it right now.\n",

    "body": "I like the idea of the tutorial waking through implementing a structure or a small project, but it seems a little out of place as written. There's lots of general \"these are rust concepts\" sections, and then all of a sudden there's a section on implementing a linked list. As @huonw pointed out, the linked-list idea also just kinda falls out of scope suddenly without much closure in what just happened.\n\nI have a feeling that @brson may want to weigh in on this, but I would be wary on adding such a sudden interjection of implementing a linked list without much of an intro or conclusion.\n",

    "body": "I think the current design of a section dedicated to every major language feature with isolated examples is material for the manual rather than a tutorial. It falls out of scope suddenly because I haven't dedicated very much time to it yet as I'm not sure it will be accepted. I do plan on extending it to be many times larger than it is at the moment and covering generics, iterators, references and other features this way.\n\nMy view of what a tutorial should be is a concise overview of the language and then jumping right in to implementing something simple like a linked list. It can then continue on with more complex examples like an AI for a simple board game. It should cover all the high-level semantics of each language feature this way but it doesn't need to get bogged down in the details as we have a manual.\n",
