    "body": "@adrientetar, the Tau Manifesto was updated last year with the aforementioned rebuttals.  @blake2-ppc is correct that this is not the place for such rhetoric, as it's been talked to death elsewhere.  That said, I would not submit this pull request if I did not think that it had value beyond a historical oddity.\n\nThe significance of \u03c4 to any programming language is simply in the intuitiveness of calculations involving radian measure.  There are a growing number of practitioners, educators and students who have embraced it as the more natural and intuitive choice for practically every application, already finding use even in engineering and science publications.  Again, I have no need of making this case here, as it is has already been laid out in considerable detail at http://tauday.com.\n\nThe patch contains almost no actual additional constants (aside from \u03c4/3 \u2261 2\u03c0/3 and 1/\u03c4 \u2261 1/(2\u03c0) for completeness), and instead defines many of them in terms of their equivalencies, e.g. FRAC_2_TAU \u2261 FRAC_1_PI.  The documentation also makes clear the equivalence.  There is no need for Rust to make any sort of stance on their relative usefulness to include them; in fact, it would be the most neutral stance to accommodate both.  Programmers accustomed to \u03c0 need not make any new life decisions, and project managers are also free to enforce the exclusive use of either constant in their style guide, although the equivalence is rudimentary.\n\nIf the primary remaining concern is API bloat, it is my understanding that dividing by powers of two is not only trivial, but preserves floating-point precision on all target platforms, and that many of the constants defined in f32 and f64 could be removed without significant inconvenience.  Assuming Rust already optimizes inline literal arithmetic (of which I am not certain), removing all circle constants but \u03c4 \u2261 2\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2261 \u03c4/2, \u03c4/3 \u2261 2\u03c0/3, \u03c0/3 \u2261 \u03c4/6, 1/\u03c4 \u2261 1/(2\u03c0), and 1/\u03c0 \u2261 2/\u03c4 (that's 12 constants, 6 equivalence pairs) would not visibly add programmer inconvenience nor runtime inefficiency, and may instead make trigonometric calculations clearer and more intuitive for users of either constant family.  The constant FRAC_2_SQRTPI := 2/\u221a\u03c0 could be retained if desired, although I have come to understand that it is merely a holdover from C99's \"math.h\", for use in the already available error functions erf() and erfc().  Most of the factors/multiples of 2 also appear to be holdovers.\n\nI already considered making the above changes, but decided I would defer to opinion first.\n",

    "body": "Alright, since the verdict is \"too many constants\", I made some very aggressive cuts, removing every factor of 2, resulting in fewer constants than we started with.  Factors of 3 remain in order to avoid a slight rounding error that occurs in double precision.  Recreating any of the missing values such as `FRAC_PI_6` is of course very simple (`FRAC_PI_3 / 2.0`).\n\nI split the removals into two commits so that the last commit can be cherry-picked out of the merge if it's deemed too aggressive.  I did however note that none of the multiples or divisions of \u03c0 are even used anywhere in this codebase, only `Float::pi()` itself (or more commonly, in many of the tests, a locally defined approximation of \u03c0, for some reason).\n\nI also removed `FRAC_2_SQRTPI`, because as mentioned previously, it seems to be defined by C99 only for use in the Gaussian error function, which is implemented by `erf()` (and its complement `erfc()`).  This function is not currently exposed by the Rust API, but it would be trivial to expose if it found relevance to Rust users.  I would instead be in favor of adding `SQRTPI`, `SQRTTAU`, `FRAC_1_SQRTPI` and `FRAC_1_SQRTTAU`, in order to cover the majority of uses of the circle constant in formulas, but that's not really in the scope of this ticket.\n",

    "body": "There is zero mathematical consensus that \u03c4 is more useful. If there were, or if the issue were even being debated, one would expect [a search](http://www.worldscientific.com/action/doSearch?AllField=tau+pi&content=articlesChapters) of a reputable journal to yield _a single journal article_ about tau. But this is not the case. There is not a single mention of replacing pi or using tau. Moreover, the first page of articles in both the \"tau\" and \"tau pi\" search results all use \u03c0!\n\nAnd \u03c0 is more fundamental anyways. The general, n-dimensional formula for the volume of an n-ball is  `V_n = \u03c0^(n/2) / \u0393(n/2 + 1) * R^n`. For the first few n, the constant before R^n is  `(V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4) = (2, \u03c0, 4\u03c0/3, \u03c0^2/2)`. The boundary of the n-ball, the (n-1)-sphere, has an (n-1)-volume equal to the derivative of this volume with respect to R, and is `S_(n-1) = n \u03c0^(n/2) / \u0393(n/2 + 1) * R^(n-1)`. For the first few n, the constant before R^(n-1) is `(S_0, S_1, S_2, S_3) = (2, 2\u03c0, 4\u03c0, 2\u03c0^2)`. Notice that \u03c4 only helps in a single dimensional case, and only with area.  And when rewritten with \u03c4, the general equations gain a factor of `2^(n/2)` to cancel out \u03c4's stupid 2, and become too ugly to write.\n\nIf Rust were to add \"TAU_*\" constants, we'd become \"that language with tau\". These constants would be used by no one: not engineers, not scientists, not mathematicians, just people who follow the Tau Manifesto. I would be dismayed if Rust joined the \u03c4-people, or even commented on such a marginal issue. It would be like if MIT started giving equal time to [phlogiston theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory) in their freshmen chemistry classes, or equal time to [intelligent design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design) in their biology classes, out of respect for the controversy. When the [Journal of Mathematical Physics](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jmp) publishes a secondary analysis acknowledging the usefulness/betterness of \u03c4 (or even a single damn article about it), let me know. Until then, keep it out of Rust. \u03c0 is more fundamental, and is used by actual mathematicians and scientists. Let's not fan this flame.\n",

    "body": "@alexchandel I do wish more people would choose to spend as much time reading [this very comprehensive, easily digested and repeatedly linked manifesto](http://www.tauday.com/tau-manifesto) as they do making arguments in ignorance of it.  Since this is apparently the forum for such arguments now, though, I'd be happy to oblige:\n\nIt's actually true that \u03c4 is not particularly fundamental to n-ball geometry, but neither is \u03c0.  Section 5 of the article decomposes the Gamma function in the n-ball volume formula to find that the fundamental constant behind it is actually the measure of a right angle, \u03c4/4 = \u03c0/2.  This makes geometric sense, since every new dimension added to the n-space is orthogonal to the last.  Nonetheless, it seems much sillier to suggest that we use that number in every formula than either \u03c0 or \u03c4.  In fact, the entire above argument is a red herring; the fact remains that \u03c4 is the _most_ fundamental number with respect to the **circle** (2-ball), which is precisely why it lends itself to more natural radian representations than \u03c0.  The constant we are debating is called the **circle constant**, after all.\n\nFrankly, it's insulting to compare this idea, something that should just be mathematical common sense, to things like phlogiston theory, but not as degrading as hearing the same flawed arguments about \u03c0's specialness repeatedly.  I do however accept the dilemma that Rust might not be ready to accept \u03c4 until wider acceptance is reached elsewhere (re: @huonw).  I also realize that examples of this may be difficult to find, even if [they do exist](http://www.tauday.com/state-of-the-tau) (and yes, even in [reputable](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284247&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6284247) [journals](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v30/Bartlett13.pdf)).  That's precisely why I had hoped to appeal to logic and intuition, rather than sentiment and politics, although I perhaps overestimated the patience of other people to simply read the manifesto and let it do the talking for me.\n\nEither way, putting this merge on hold is understandable.  I can wait.\n",

Since it is already necessary to go through the helper functions in `Float` and supply a type annotation to get to the constants, it's fairly arbitrary what they are named by the programmer.  Admittedly, this largely explains why I am not particularly attached to this merge; the only advantage would be a standardized location for the constant.  If acceptance reaches critical mass through independent means, then I'm sure this topic will come up again.\n\nMy only disappointment is in the poor rhetoric displayed here.

    "body": "@bugQ I've read that before, and the section in the Tau Manifesto you reference doesn't make your case. It begins by replacing Gamma, a uniquely constrained meromorphic function, with the discontinuous floor function, the _almost-nowhere-defined_ double factorial, a `2^n`, and a piecewise factor. It manages to eliminates the piecewise factor by substituting in `pi/2`, a smart move. It then asserts `V[n] == S[n-1] / n`, therefore \u03c4 is preferred (even though this rule fails to give the volume of a 0-ball). But I can just as easily say that `S[n-1] == V_n * n`, therefore \u03c0 is preferred (and mine _does_ give the volume of a 0-ball, since it begins with V's). So this route of argument is moot. In either case, it's clear that this isn't \"mathematical common sense\". A Cargo package for all the TAU_\\* constants or a variable like \"`static TAU: f64 = Float::two_pi();`\" addresses any minority needs.\n",

    "body": "@bugQ There's no need to be combative; this is a courteous, listening community. You said that my point was refuted in the Tau Manifesto, and I showed this wasn't the case. Dismissing my point as irrelevant isn't correct either: You emphasize the 2-dimensional embedding, and argue \u03c4 is the fundamental circle constant, being the ratio of S_1 to r^1. I could just as easily argue that \u03c0 is the fundamental circle constant, being the ratio of V_2 to r^2. But both of these numbers have meaning beyond the 2D case, and when you derive the general formulae, all of the integrals except the first are from `0` to `\u03c0`, and the end results are simplest with \u03c0. I would disagree that \u03c0/2 is simpler, since that requires replacing the `\u0393` with a `floor`, a `!!`, and a `2^n`. I expect most mathematicians would argue that \u0393 has greater mathematical beauty than the double factorial; it's certainly simpler.\nAs I said before, no one would object to a \u03c4 Cargo package, and it might help those who use \u03c4 for angles. It would certainly increase the footprint of the language in a noncontroversial fashion. Feel free to make one.\n",

    "body": "Actually, I feel like I deserve @alexchandel an explanation, since the answer to their question is apparently subtle.  As I said before (twice), you are correct that the generalizations of _S_ and _V_ do not reveal any aesthetic preference _for_ either \u03c4 or \u03c0, but they do reveal a point _against_ \u03c0: that its importance is _incidental_, rather than fundamental.  The underlying reason is quite simple: as long as \u03c0 is defined by a circle's diameter, it remains incongruous with the entirety of geometry.  In fact, I can't think of a single formula outside of the definition \u03c0 = _C_/_d_ that forgoes _r_ in favor of _d_.  This simple fact is what underlies every single failing of \u03c0, from calculus to particle physics.  I would encourage you to reread Section 5.2 (and perhaps the others as well) with that in mind.\n\nThere is one last ray of hope, though: it follows that \u03c0 would finally earn its stars if we were to define circles in a way that employed the diameter in a non-trivial way and endeavored to use _d_ in place of _r_ in all of geometry.  Disregarding the havok it would wreak on the concept of \"radians\" and who knows what else, I submit that even if such a non-trivial use of _d_ were found, it would not match the simplicity of the current definition.  Either way, the far easier method of resolving this incongruency is to replace the circle constant, instead of _r_.\n",
