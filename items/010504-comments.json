    "body": "I have also found this annoying for locally understanding a function\n\n``` rust\nlet a = ~1;\nfoo(a)\n```\n\nDoes that function call move `a` or does it not? Turns out it depends on the declaration of `foo`.\n\nI think that an interesting exercise for this issue would be removing autoref/autoderef for function arguments. I have a feeling that the change would be incredibly painful and probably not worth it, but this is probably something that should at least be considered.\n\nThe alternative would be\n\n``` rust\nlet a = ~1;\nfoo(&*a)\n```\n\nWhich does look a bit silly, but it is clear to all who read it that the argument is not moved, but rather borrowed. I'm not personally a big fan of this syntax.\n\nAnother idea of how to go about this would be to very clearly document this in the tutorial/manual. This may be done already, but I'm not sure how well autoref/autoderef is covered overall.\n",

    "body": "Reading the comments and discussing with @wycats, I hadn't considered the possibility of extending the autoborrow to encompass `T -> &T` (what we call \"autoref\" in a method call). Hmm. I think I'd rather err on the side of less magic at the moment, but that is an interesting possibility that wouldn't be too hard to do, and maybe it means less annoying little `&`.\n\nStill, what I dislike most about the autoborrowing is that I can't tell from a call site when I am passing by value and when I am not. That is, I dislike seeing this:\n\n```\nlet x = ~[1,2,3];\nfoo(x);\n```\n\nbecause it _looks to me_ like `x` has been given away. But in fact then I look at `foo` and find:\n\n```\nfn foo(x: &[int]) { ... }\n```\n\nand so I see that in fact `x` was only borrowed. I think I find it easy to understand the flow of ownership if I don't have to look at the declarations of the fns being called. YMMV.\n",

We currently do permit rvalues to be implicitly autoref'd in a mutable way because of iterators.

    "body": "Here's another similar issue I ran into today when trying to explain things to someone:\n\n``` rs\nuse std::io::stdio::println;\n\nstruct Person{\n  first_name: ~str,\n  last_name: ~str\n}\n\nimpl<'self> Person {\n  pub fn new(first: ~str, last: ~str) -> ~Person {\n    ~Person{ first_name: first, last_name: last }\n  }\n\n  pub fn full_name(&self) -> ~str {\n    self.first_name + \" \" + self.last_name\n  }\n\n  pub fn get_first_name(&'self self) -> &'self str {\n    self.first_name\n  }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let person = Person::new(~\"Tom\", ~\"Dale\");\n  println(person.get_first_name());\n  println(person.full_name());\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the use of `self.first_name` inside of `get_first_name` was a compiler error:\n\n```\nhello.rs:18:4: 18:19 error: mismatched types: expected `&'self str` but found `~str` (str storage differs: expected &'self  but found ~)\nhello.rs:18     self.first_name\n                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n```\n\nThe solution was to do:\n\n``` rs\npub fn get_first_name(&'self self) -> &'self str {\n  self.first_name.as_slice()\n}\n```\n\nSince I have a `~str` here and I need a `&str`, which has strictly more restrictions, I would expect Rust to automatically demote the `~str` to a `&str`.\n\nAs a side note, orthogonal to this point, `as_slice()` is a somewhat leaky abstraction, because it exposes details about the implementation of `~str` and `&str` that aren't necessary to reason about the ownership semantics (and the ownership semantics tell you everything you need to know about the relative cost of &str vs ~str).\n",

Maybe that's ok.\n\n@nikomatsakis I rather liked the idea of the invariant you stated in a [blog post](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/05/14/procedures/) a while back. Namely \"you don\u2019t have allocation unless you see a sigil\". The example you gave, and the automatic coercion of arguments in general seems to break this which is unfortunate, and I think a good argument against the coercion.\n",

I've followed that blog for a long time, thus have read the post you mentioned.\n\nThe latest post http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/11/20/parameter-coercion-in-rust/ is really good work, covering many aspects of this issue. I can't agree with \"if we remove autoborrow the notational overhead will be too large\" and \"it\u2019s not actually possible to reason about a function independently of its callees\" any more.\n",
