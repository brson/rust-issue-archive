    "body": "@huon Good point. Also, it looks tricky with the current infrastructure to even lint on the macro invocation -- the backtrace of macro expansion does not appear to link to the def_id of the macro (or give any other way of getting at the macro's stability).\n\nNevertheless, I think we should bail out of the lint when we hit the results of expansion; those should be checked, if anywhere, at the site of macro definition.\n\nOne other question: do syntax extensions also produce the span information you mentioned above? I ask because @brson's original problematic cases are written syntax extensions. If not, is there some other way of telling that an expansion happened?\n",
