    "body": "Xcode is the more important bit, that's what controls e.g. whether the system actually has GCC installed. Although more recent versions of Xcode do tend to drop support for older versions of the OS (I'm not sure offhand what the OS support is for the most recent stable Xcode).\n\nAs soon as it's feasible to do so, it would be good to test on OS X 10.10 though (it's still in beta, which is why I'm not saying it should be tested now, although it certainly _could_ be). This is primarily because it appears that 10.10 has somehow changed the default `LDPATH`, which causes issues when trying to link against third-party libraries that live in `/usr/local/lib` (because I can't pass `-L /usr/local/lib` to rustc or it breaks when trying to find its own libraries as now it finds duplicates). This is documented in #13733.\n",
