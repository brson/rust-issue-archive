That's why this test doesn't work! Because we are operating at a low level, we don't have uniform representation and implicit boxing and so forth. Therefore, like C++, we monomorphize generic functions---this implies that we would require an infinite set of functions to deal with recursive functions like the one you wrote here (note that other cases of polymorphic recursion work just fine, so long as they don't generate an infinite stream of types). I am going to close this as \"not a bug, working as designed\".\n\n(There's a variety of other discussion about this on those issues also.)\n",
