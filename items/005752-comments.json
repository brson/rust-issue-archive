For example, I know that \"tuple structs\" exist, but I honestly couldn't tell you what they are or how they are declared. Are they just named tuples? Because that really has nothing to do with structs at all. Same with newtype'd structs, I fear. It all feels very haphazard. If nothing else, we really need some better docs here.\n",
