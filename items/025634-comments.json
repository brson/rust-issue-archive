Currently we're probably not going to have an issue-per-feature to stabilize, and we plan to stabilize this once [`const fn`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25609) lands (allowing `UnsafeCell::new`). I'm going to close this in favor of that as once that feature is stabilized this should \"just work\"!\n",
