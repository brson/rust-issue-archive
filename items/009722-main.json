  "body": "According to http://huonw.github.io/isrustfastyet/mem/#012f909, the \"const\nmarking\" pass generates about 400MB of extra memory during compilation. It\nappears that this is due to two different factors:\n\n```\n1. There is a `ccache` map in the ty::ctxt which is only ever used in this\n   pass, so this commit moves the map out of the ty::ctxt struct and into\n   just this pass's visitor. This turned out to not benefit that much in\n   memory (as indicated by http://i.imgur.com/Eo4iOzK.png), but it's helpful\n   to do nonetheless.\n\n2. During const_eval, there are a lot of lookups into decoding inlined items\n   from external crates. There is no caching involved here, so the same\n   static or variant could be re-translated many times. After adding\n   separate caches for variants and statics, the memory peak of compiling\n   rustc decreased by 200MB (as evident by http://i.imgur.com/ULAUMtq.png)\n```\n\nThe culmination of this is basically a slight reorganization of a caching map\nfor the const_eval pass along with a 200MB decrease in peak memory usage when\ncompiling librustc.\n",
