I guess I'm kinda ok with it?\nApr 29 23:23:15 <SiegeLord> Not all RNGs actually implement that trait with the true seed\nApr 29 23:23:45 <huon>  that's a \"true seed\" for those RNGs\nApr 29 23:24:03 <huon>  i.e. it's legitimate them to see them with partial data\nApr 29 23:24:09 <huon>  *seed\nApr 29 23:24:15 <SiegeLord> I'd think the same would work for XorShift one\nApr 29 23:24:20 <huon>  I guess?\nApr 29 23:24:27 <SiegeLord> The only dissallowed value is all 0's for it\nApr 29 23:25:31 <huon>  I think the seed type would have to be u8\nApr 29 23:25:42 <huon>  hm, actually that's a lie\nApr 29 23:26:17 <huon>  SiegeLord: using a uniform seed type possibly introduces endianness issues\nApr 29 23:26:26 <huon>  (but it's late so I'm not thinking quickly atm...)\nApr 29 23:26:41 <SiegeLord> That's a good point...\nApr 29 23:26:48 <SiegeLord> I'll think about it some more...\nApr 29 23:27:25 <SiegeLord> I just want to be able to pass the seed as a command line argument and it seems... odd for me to create a shim between that number and these implementation-specific values\n```\n",

    "body": "I actually don't think it's as big of an issue today, because all of the RNGs implement `Rand`, so you can do:\n\n``` rust\nlet seed_rng = XorShiftRng::from_seed([1, 2, 3, 4]);\nlet your_real_rng: IsaacRng = seed_rng.gen();\n```\n\nBy routing your seeding through `XorShiftRng` you obtain the desired uniform seeding interface. The seed for `XorShiftRng` is a bit large, and it's not clear to me how to easily seed it from a command line argument, but to me it seems to be a separate issue. Perhaps a simpler RNG that only takes a `u64` as a seed would work here, but it will naturally be a poor RNG, so maybe it's a bad idea to do this.\n",

I think this example should be added to the docs.\n\nHowever, this is not exactly the desired interface, because it only works for seeds that are of type `[u32, ..4]`. It excludes two important use cases:\n- Seeding just an integer.\n- Seeds larger than 2^128.\n\nThe latter is maybe not that important (still, some user might want to have a larger seed space), but it would be covered by a `&[u32]` interface.\n",
