    "body": "Still an issue. Test case:\n\n```\nfn bar<'a>(x: &'a int) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", x);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    bar(&42);\n}\n```\n\nprints:\n\n```\n&42\n```\n\nShould print... something else, probably.\n\nAnother testcase:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<'a> {\n    x: &'a int\n}\n\nfn bar<'a>(x: &'a int) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", Foo {x:x});\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    bar(&42);\n}\n```\n\nprints:\n\n```\nFoo<>{x: &42}\n```\n\nwhich is blatently wrong.\n\n@thestinger were you refering to the first case, or the second? The first case looks impossible to implement, since each pointer to a type with a lifetime would have a different tydesc, The second might end up being the same, though I'm not sure. We could add lifetimes to the type name, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort actually adding lifetime support to our reflection.\n",
