    "body": "Ah thanks for the ping @briansmith, I should give a status update on this. Currently unwinding on 64-bit MSVC is fully implemented using DWARF side tables like the GNU triple uses and we implement the necessary runtime support to parse these side tables. Unwinding on 32-bit MSVC is unimplemented, however. I have not investigated too closely what it would mean to implement DWARF unwinding for 32-bit like we have for 64-bit (I believe @vadimcn knows more about this than I do).\n\nMy current idea for implementing 32-bit is to wait for [LLVM's exception handling intrinsics](http://llvm.org/docs/ExceptionHandling.html#exception-handling-using-the-windows-runtime) to be fully implemented. I'm under the impression they're relatively experimental for now and are unlikely to work for us (but I haven't checked in awhile). Once those exist we can switch to those for 32 and 64 bit MSVC, tweak some runtime support, and in theory \"Just Work\".\n\nIn any case, however, unwinding from C++ to Rust is undefined behavior no matter what happens (and vice versa), so exceptions/panics must always be caught at FFI boundaries. In that sense SEH compatible unwinding isn't necessary, but we need a solution for 32-bit still.\n",

    "body": "> SEH compatible unwinding isn't necessary, but we need a solution for 32-bit still.\n\nRight. Maybe I misunderstood, but my impression is that people felt that resolving this was blocked on SEH-compatible unwinding. My point is that a lot of people targetting -msvc don't need or want SEH-compatible unwinding, especially if it has negative perf/size implications. That is, if this bug were resolved with (only) a SEH-compatible unwinder, then there should be a follow-up issue to track more efficient unwinding.\n\nI believe the LLVM work is intended to support mixing MSVC-compiled C++ code with clang-compiled C++ code with exceptions that traverse stacks of code implemented with each compiler; i.e. 100% interop with the MSVC C++ ABI. That's quite a different problem from what Rust needs, AFAICT.\n\nAFAICT, the requirements for the unwinder are just that implementations of `Drop` have their `drop` method called, and that a panic terminates the thread in a way that the thing that spawned the thread can recover from. Relative to the other things mentioned above, these seem like much simpler things to address.\n",

In particular, 32-bit Windows apps work on 64-bit Windows AND 32-bit Windows. From the end-user-of-Rust perspective, it seems very risky to wait for LLVM to eventually fix this, especially when Alex said that LLVM's implementation is likely to not even work for Rust even when it is finished at some unknown point in time in the future. That said, I'm biased because I've invested a lot of time to create infrastructure software in Rust, and in order to convince people to use my software, I have to convince them that Rust isn't super risky, and this is one of the issues that people have mentioned as a concern.\n",

(Maybe delete or ~~strike it through~~ from the issue above?)\n\nWhat do you think the timeline is on getting unwinding support for 32bit? This year? Next year?\n\nI agree with @briansmith that Windows 32bit is the platform with the biggest userbase period. I'm working on porting to Rust an existing Windows app where file size matters. So need to use 32 bit to reach both 32 and 64 bit Windows users. No stack unwinding doesn't make it impossible to write the app, but it makes it harder to debug and much harder to convince people that this is a good idea to do.\n\nI'm not compiler hacker, but is there anything I can do to help? \n",

    "body": "> What do you think the timeline is on getting unwinding support for 32bit?\n\nMy current thoughts are to hold off until LLVM 3.8 and then try again to use the native MSVC unwinding intrinsics, but that's mostly because I don't know of the status of that implementation in LLVM. If it's ready now then we'd be fine just updating the submodule we've got and using it.\n\n@vadimcn has a point though, does the gnu 32-bit triple not work for you? If you're compiling and linking with an MSVC-compiled native library it may not work out well but otherwise it should work!\n",
