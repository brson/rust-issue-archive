    "body": "I'm not sure that the unhandled condition and the assertion error are quite related, but the assertion error is somehow probably related to deflation of metadata hitting an error. When you say that you're using the stage0 snapshots, what do you mean by that? Are the steps to produce this simply to check out the repo and run `make` or are the some more things in play?\n\nI think that the `-L` directories your passing to `gdb` may be containing different versions of the same library which may be causing `flate` to go haywire, but the original unhandled condition problem is disturbing. Could you get a backtrace for when the unhandle condition error is thrown?\n",
