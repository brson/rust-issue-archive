    "body": "I was thinking about the names of these functions, and I figure that it'd be nice to get them right this time instead of having to revert back later. Here's what I've found:\n\nToday we have `fmt`, and it returns a `~str` instance. We also have `printf` and `printfln` which write to stdout (currently by allocating a string, and _then_ writing). What we'd like to make room for is somewthing which also writes to a `&mut io::Writer`.\n\nThere's basically three operations we want to support: formatting into a string, formatting onto stdout, and formatting into a writer. I looked at a few other languages to see what they do\n- go - `fmt.Printf`, `fmt.Fprintf`, `fmt.Sprintf`\n- python - no support from what I could tell, only `sprintf` support through the `format` method on strings or the `%` operator\n- C - `printf`, `fprintf`, `sprintf`\n- java - `System.out.printf`, maybe a `PrintStream.printf`, and `String.format`\n- ruby - `printf` and `sprintf`, couldn't find an `fprintf` equivalent.\n\nThere's a pretty clear pattern here, and I'd like to not deviate too far from it. Right now, if we wanted to keep `fmt` as a base, I'd vote to move towards `fmt`/`ffmt`/`sfmt` to print to stdout/stream/string. Sadly though, `ffmt` looks a bit silly, and so does `sfmt`.\n\nWith those in mind, what would others think about moving directly to `printf`/`fprintf`/`sprintf` as the macros? The pro is that everyone's already familiar with them and knows exactly what they do. The con is that it's a longer name than `fmt`. Also brought up is that `fprintf` doesn't necessarily imply \"all writers\", but staying in the tradition with other languages I'd still vote to call it `fprintf`.\n\nThoughts?\n",
