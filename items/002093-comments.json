I believe the two forms are basically equivalent but for `ret`, `for`, and of course the fact that sugar closures infer the protocol (`fn@` vs `fn&`), for better or worse.\n\nAh, there is one other difference: you can have capture clauses on `fn@` and friends, but not on a sugared closure.\n\nI was going to propose changing the syntax to amend that distinction, but I forgot about it.

To my knowledge we have removed [**] the `[<sigil>] fn (<id>, ...) { <body> ... }` value-expression syntax (there is still a `[<sigil>] fn(<type> ...) -> <type>` type-expression syntax, but that is not relevant here).\n3. Anyway, my point is, this bug seems like it can be closed, since the syntactic form which which it is concerned no longer exists.  (Unless I have grossly misunderstood the situation, but all my experiments on test programs indicate that this value-expression syntax no longer exists.)\n\n[**] I cannot find the reference for a meeting where removing the value-expression form was decided; the closest I have come to doing so is the [weekly mtg from 2013-02-19](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-02-19), where Niko discussed allowing one to put the sigils on the front of the `|<id>, ...| { <body> ...}` form.\n",
