    "body": "This is a driveby comment from someone with no real stake, so please give it only as much thought as it deserves, which is not much:\n\nIt might make sense for stderr to be unbuffered by default. This is the case in Perl, Python, Ruby, and C, and probably other languages (those are the only ones I checked.) I'm sure there are good reasons for this beyond the ones I will list here, but mine are: In the event of a crash, you want to have the most up-to-date output from stderr, and unlike stdout you typically aren't ever sending huge volumes of data through stderr in a potentially performance-critical way (such that default-buffering is beneficial enough to outweigh the surprise it causes.)\n",
