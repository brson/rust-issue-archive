After looking at code on both sides of this divide, I feel like the TLS approach is frankly a lot simpler; less code everywhere, less chance of linked pieces of code accidentally using different interners. In my mind, the right way to manage the size of the interner is to have a dynamic parameterize-like mechanism for setting and clearing the interner. \n\nSo, personally, I would make this a WONTFIX.\n",

Let me know if this doesn't make sense.\n",

It makes it very easy to analyze what a function reads and affects -- and I mean this both automatically and for the human user. I guess for my taste I've found careful use of methods to generally be satisfactory.  Still, I'm not sure whether this bug is worth fixing or not, I can't say I've looked too closely at the code. Certainly having the interner in TLS is nice when debugging (and the type context would be nice too...)\n\n(As an aside, scala is the only language I know that attempts to provide something other than TLS vs explicit parameters, with its implicit parameter lists)\n",
