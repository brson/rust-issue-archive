    "body": "I did some experiments on this and AFAICT there are the following open issues:\n- #3066: reported file!/line! is in the macro declaration, not the macro use\n- #3114 Macro import/export\n- Getting the expression as a string: stringify! unhelpfully returns \"an interpolated expression\", while quote_expr! fails during compilation with the following message: `rust: task failed at 'quote! with interpolated token', rust-0.5/src/libsyntax/ext/quote.rs:389`\n\nRegarding that last one, any suggestions for a course of action? Is there any good way to get the actual expression inside of a macro? Barring that would fixing quote.rs be a better solution than to_str() in token.rs?\n\nFor reference, here is the current POC:\n\n```\nmacro_rules! Assert(\n    ($inp:expr) => (\n        if(!$inp) {\n                io::println(fmt!(\"Assertion '%s' failed, %s:%u\", stringify!($inp), file!(), line!()));\n            }\n    )\n)\n```\n\nThis gets me as far as: `Assertion 'an interpolated expression' failed, assert-poc.rs:52`\n\"Assert\" is capitalized, since \"assert\" is a keyword. Any ideas on how to handle that in the future?\n",
