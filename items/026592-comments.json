    "body": "I'm not quite sure what this is suggesting. I think it wants us to pretend the system allocator is jemalloc if --disable-jemalloc? But I'd expect that to be transparent to us (whether the systema alloc is jemalloc or not we should still call the same functions, I think -- not certain, though.) On the other hand, it's possible this is asking that when the APIs are available then we should compile with a system-provided jemalloc. That seems rather hard. Either way, I don't think this is something we'd look to implement quite right now. If you're interested, I'd file a thread on internals for discussion!",
