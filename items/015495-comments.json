    "body": "This is a little subtle and comes down to [moves vs. copies](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24253573/1256624), due to `current` taking `self` by value.\n\n``` rust\n    fn current(self) -> uint {\n```\n\nIf you change that to `fn current(&self) -> uint`, i.e. take `self` by reference it will work.\n\nThe reason it works when there is no `Vec` is `CountDown` becomes `Copy`, i.e. a by-value use doesn't have to consume the source, essentially it just duplicates the `CountDown` instance out of the `&mut self` in `next` giving `current` its own independent copy. As soon as you have a `Vec` this is illegal (see my linked stack overflow answer above), and so the compiler complains.\n\nThanks for filing, but this isn't a bug, closing. :)\n",
