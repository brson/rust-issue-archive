    "body": "All the non-Windows ports currently in `mk/cfg` support returning from a SIGSEGV handler:\n- Per Breakpad, Linux, at least i386, x86-64, arm, aarch64, and mips.\n- Per [the JVM](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/os_cpu/bsd_x86/vm/os_bsd_x86.cpp#l604), OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFlyBSD on x86 and x86-64. \n- Per Mono, which [installs a signal handler to convert NULL pointer dereferences into C# exceptions](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/931/how-to-prevent-ios-crash-reporters-from-crashing-monotouch-apps), iOS. (I think they even stuff a new stack frame on the main stack, for extra awesome.)\n- Per libsigsegv, Linux on PPC.\n\n(There are some overIaps and some of these sources attest to way more, I just wanted to confirm that at least one source attests to each current Rust target. I don't actually think this is arch-specific on any OS.) So this is safe to do unconditionally, as @alexcrichton has done in PR #27338, and I'm happy to let that PR close this.\n\nPorters to new UNIXes may need to watch for this for correctness. This is also safe on Solaris (per Breakpad and JVM); I think the only non-supporting UNIX that Rust might realistically get ported to is MINIX 3.\n",
