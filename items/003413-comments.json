    "body": "@graydon that's not quite what I meant.  I just meant that if we are not careful with how we define the rules, then `return {x}` will not work.  For example, my initial thought for how to define the rule was \"if the return (resp. tail expression) is a path and the path is a local variable defined in the function block (resp. block), then the value is implicitly moved\".  But that will not work for `return {x}` because the return expression is a block, not a path, and the tail expression of `{x}` is a local variable but not one defined within the block itself.\n\nSo the rule has to be more subtle and consider the \"destination\" of the copy.  Something like: \"a reference to a local variable is an implicit move if the destination will be out of the variable's scope\", but of course we need to define \"destination\".  Essentially it seems like a top-down sort of analysis to me, where each block has a notion of its \"destination\", with the fn body and any block that appears after a return having a destination of \"outside the fn\" (in terms of the implementation, perhaps the node id 0).  Internal blocks have a destination of the expression that they are a part of.  When looking at a block whose tail expression is a local variable, we consider the block's destination id and compare it against the id of the block where the variable was declared.  This can be generalized in a fairly straightforward way to arbitrary \"owned\" expressions, if that seems worth the trouble.\n",
