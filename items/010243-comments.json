    "body": "I experimented some time back with a couple of ways of doing file modes without needing to resort to comparatively meaningless numbers; for example, defining a macro which could take every possible combination and turn it into a number (that revealed severe performance problems on macros with many thousands of rules... who'd 'a thunked it? If you were doing it seriously, you'd do it as an ultra-fast syntax extension, not as a ridiculously expensive macro that adds three minutes to compile time whether used or not) or constants for every possible combination, like `rwxr_S__t`. That was a fun experiment in testing unusual conditions in the compiler (it didn't crash anywhere, it merely performed atrociously), but I don't expect it to be taken very seriously.\n\nStill, the principle is right: often defining constants will be sufficient for your purposes. A quick look at the Apollo Guidance Computer suggests it uses octal memory addresses, which would suggest that constants are slightly infeasible and having octal literals would indeed be of value for that case (but you _could_ theoretically define lots of constants or use a macro, like I did!). Still, octal is used by surprisingly few things.\n\nPotentially of more use would be making it possible to have **arbitrary base literals**. As a demo with no more than twenty-seven seconds' thought put into the syntax, I can imagine something like `8b777` meaning octal `777`, `56b14NcYrmxFCN9wAHhxCHkyt4PU9bqnveBUj` meaning `14NcYrmxFCN9wAHhxCHkyt4PU9bqnveBUj` in base-56\u2014Bitcoin address literals! There are times when writing various algorithms when having base-3 or base-4 would be convenient, for example (alas, base64 probably isn't going to work for tokenising reasons).\n",
