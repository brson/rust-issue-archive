    "body": "Question: in a trait or impl, should it be possible to call `foo(x)` where `foo` is a method in scope? We don't allow calling `foo()` (i.e., with an implicit self), but we do allow calling `bar` where bar is a function in scope. It seems to me like we should allow it since it is weird to need qualification of an item in an inner scope but not an outer one. OTOH, it means we would get worse error messages where a programmer has omitted an explicit self, since it would just be a \"not enough args\" error, rather than something more specific.\n",

    "body": "I've found a few consequences of the RFC that I haven't seen mentioned before, while trying to design a full implementation:\nResolve wouldn't need to track `impl`s _at all_. This means UFCS reverts [the need to force `impl`s to be in the same module with their type](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0155-anonymous-impl-only-in-same-module.md).\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo<T>;\nmod bar {\n    impl super::Foo<()> { // impl allowed outside of Foo's module.\n        fn bar(&self) -> Option<()> { None }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Foo<bool> {\n    // same method name, allowed only because Self cannot overlap\n    // with any other impl with the same method (as with trait impls).\n    fn bar(&self) -> Option<bool> { Some(true) }\n}\n\n// anonymous impls would be checked by coherence as if they were\n// implementing traits from outside the current crate.\nimpl<T> [Foo<T>] {\n    fn extra(&self) -> usize { 0 }\n}\nimpl<T> Vec<Foo<T>> {\n    fn extra(&self) -> usize { self.capacity() - self.len() }\n}\n```\n\nAll of these combined will end up removing some extension traits, and make type aliases much more powerful, without special-casing them. This will be possible, given we [complete defaulted type params](rust-lang/rfcs#213):\n\n``` rust\n// std::collections (the collections crate wouldn't have a clue about RNGs):\ntype HashMap<K, V, H = RandomizedSipHash> = collections_crate::HashMap<K, V, H>;\n```\n\nOn the other hand, `i32::foo` would only mean `<i32>::foo`, so you couldn't use modules like `std::i32` at all. For this, I propose a relatively simple solution:\n\n``` rust\n// in libcore:\n#[lang=\"i32\"]\nenum i32 {} // unihabited enum introduces a type in scope and nothing else\n\n// coherence would allow this impl as the type is \"rooted\" in the crate\n// defining the lang item.\nimpl i32 {\n    fn foo(self) -> ... {...}\n}\n```\n\nThat would also make the rustdoc special handling for primitives a bit simpler.\n\nThen again, that last one isn't necessary. I just checked and the only [items in `std::i32`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/i32/) are a few constants which would be better off in [the `Int` trait](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/trait.Int.html), once we get associated constants.\nI would still like having all those primitives in the prelude, but I guess the situation isn't as dire.\n\n**EDIT**: [`std::str`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/) has 3 free functions (and a bunch of types/traits), maybe it's a better example of a primitive type with an \"associated\" module.\n",

My `Foo::destructuring()` takes self by read-only reference, while yours takes it by value - and of course it can be destructured in the body; by then it's a variable like any other. That's not the point.\n\nThe point is that UFCS, as far as I can see, was specified as making it such that defining a first parameter of type `[&[mut ]]Self` as a trait function would permit method-call syntax. It's not destructuring in the argument list that's special either - for anything other than `Self` it works flawlessly, and even for `Self` it works when either invoked as a static function or in any parameter but the first.\n\nThe problem is that the method-call syntax is being forbidden when it should be allowed - i.e., exactly UFCS.\n\nOne use case where this is especially nice, for its pure concision: Implementing state machines where each state is a newtype.\n",

    "body": "@eternaleye it's true that we initially intended to not make the name significant, but I think that ship has sailed (and it's worth amending the RFC). For one thing, it would be backwards incompatible to make a change here, as it would introduce potential new ambiguities into method dispatch (though I don't know whether this would actually affect any crates in practice).\n\nBut also, I've shifted my opinion as to what I think is best. I think it is actively useful to be able to exclude functions from being used as methods, because it allows you to avoid potential conflicts between traits (any number of traits can have associated fns with the same name, but if method notation forces those names to be in conflict if a single type implements all the traits).\n\nI also think there is just a certain amount of clarity in a rule like \"associated fns whose first argument uses the `self` keyword can be used as methods\"; it tells you what the trait author had in mind, and encourages a more uniform style on users of the trait.\n\nIt also means that we can impose a rule that says: \"if you use the keyword `self`, the type must be derefable to `Self`\", rather than us deducing whether the type is derefable to `Self`. Figuring out _if_ something holds is generally much harder than requiring that it _does_ hold, particularly around generic code.\n",
