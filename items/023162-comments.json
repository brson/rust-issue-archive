    "body": "> But if we didn't inline it at all there'd be overhead from repeatedly copying the builder struct around.\n\nAh ok. If we're trying to minimize codegen though I would probably recommend a `&mut self`-based builder as it would involve far fewer moves. The `finish` method could replace the inner result with `Ok(())`, for example, so it doesn't necessarily have to consume.\n\nIn general I'm not so sure about the application of `#[inline]` throughout these methods. I would be much more convinced with some data though! Without some statistics in favor of the `#[inline]`, I think I'd personally prefer they'd all be removed for now. One interesting statistic would be the before/after size of librustdoc. I know that the lib has probably hundreds of `#[derive(Debug)]` and if this cuts down on codegen it should really help that size.\n\nOtherwise, my only other concern is the usage in `#[derive]`. I'm a little unsure about how we lint stability in `#[derive]`-based implementations, but I just wanted to confirm that this does not require the `core` feature gate? I personally don't necessarily like the compiler being able to call unstable internals (e.g. the expanded AST won't actually compiled b/c it calls unstable code) where other code cannot, but it's also something we're at liberty to change so I'd be fine giving this a whirl to see what happens!\n",
