  "body": "This is mostly a prototype for future changes. I assume more\ncomplicated methods like unpoison_with_condvar may need to be added\nbut the whole complicated mess of varying types of writes, and reads\nneed to be refactored, and turned into a cleaner, and better interface\nanyways. Personally, I need this operation to implement functions for\nthe library of concurrent data structures I am working on but this\noperation may be of interest to others.\n\nA rustic style for cleaning up the interface is unclear to me at the\nmoment but a possible example in Haskell might be to use a monad, and\nhave write simply be a consequence of the logically more primitive\nread, and unpoison operations. This monadic approach in Haskell might\nlook like the following:\n\n```\natomicIncrement var = atomically $ do\n     x <- read var\n     var $= x + 1\n```\n",
