  "body": "- The lint visitor's visit_ty method did not recurse, and had a\n  reference to the now closed #10894\n- The newly enabled recursion has only affected the `deprectated` lint\n  which now detects uses of deprecated items in trait impls and\n  function return types\n- Renamed some references to `CowString` and `CowVec` to `Cow<str>` and\n  `Cow<[T]>`, respectively, which appear outside of the crate which\n  defines them\n- Replaced a few instances of `InvariantType<T>` with\n  `PhantomData<Cell<T>>`\n- Disabled the `deprecated` lint in several places that\n  reference/implement traits on deprecated items which will get cleaned\n  up in the future\n- Unfortunately, this means that if a library declares\n  `#![deny(deprecated)]` and marks anything as deprecated, it will have\n  to disable the lint for any uses of said item, e.g. any impl the now\n  deprecated item\n\nFor any library that denies deprecated items but has deprecated items\nof its own, this is a [breaking-change]\n\nI had originally intended for the lint to ignore uses of deprecated items that are declared in the same crate, but this goes against some previous test cases that expect the lint to capture _all_ uses of deprecated items, so I maintained the previous approach to avoid changing the expected behavior of the lint.\n\nTested locally on OS X, so hopefully there aren't any deprecated item uses behind a `cfg` that I may have missed.\n",
