    "body": "While not impossible, I didn't see a clear way to do them. When I think about it I don't think the privacy checker should exist in its current form today. Right now it runs on the def_id of an invocation and bails out if the item itself is private, but this needs to take into account different scopes of information.\n\nRight now, it'd be easiest to shove this check into resolve, but I think resolve doesn't really need to get bigger. One awesome thing which could be done is to completely remove the idea of privacy from resolve and completely leave it up to the privacy checker. The privacy checker would then have to be aware of the module hierarchy, but I don't think that's really too hard.\n\n@pcwalton, what do you think about moving privacy completely into `privacy.rs`? That way resolve would resolve _everything_ regardless of whether it's public or private, and then the privacy check pass would be solely responsible for gating whether an access is allowed or not. I'm not quite sure how feasible that would be, but it would be nice from an implementation perspective...\n\nRegardless, the error message I think is difficult to improve now, but I like the idea of improving it later on.\n",
