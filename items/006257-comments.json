    "body": "@huonw there is some subtlety here regarding how we select matching trait methods. In this case, you are expecting that we will match`Eq` with \"Self = `&int`\", but what actually happens is that we match Eq with `Self = int`. Note that the _receiver_ is defined as `&self`.\n\nThat said, something just occurred to me. I think that the problem is not with autoderef per se, but rather with the way that we define the binary operator traits. We ought to define them as follows:\n\n```\ntrait Eq {\n    fn eq(a: &Self, b: &Self);\n}\n```\n\nmeaning that `x==y` would be expanded to:\n\n```\nEq::eq(&x, &y)\n```\n\nThe same would apply to other binary operator traits. \n\nNote that there would be no auto-deref in this case.\n",
