This is also something I wanted to do for some time now because it makes the tests more consistent.\n\n@brson:\nThese changes are in response to issue #17540. It works on my machine with the toolchain mentioned in the issue. In order to find out if the problem is really worked around, we also need to make the build bots use the newer GDB version again.\n",
