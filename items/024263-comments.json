    "body": "RE the documentation issue: The value wouldn't be unstable for the case of a C-like enum, so the statement about the value being unstable should be qualified as such. And, it would also be useful to document that this feature can/should be used instead of `as` for safer conversions of C-like enums. A new lint that does that would be great.\n\nHowever, the RFC says that the type is always `u64` which means that I'd have to use `as` in my code anyway, as I need `u8`-typed discriminant values (e.g. for parsing ASN.1). Accordingly, I think that the part of the design where the return type is fixed at `u64` should be fixed.\n",

Also, `Repr` corresponds to the signedness of the enum in the case of things like `#[repr(i8)]` which makes it easier to compare discriminants for ordering.\n",

For Servo\u2019s `style` crate, the only thing missing is `discriminant_value`. (https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/11816)\n\nWe use it with an enum that represents a property declaration: there\u2019s one variant per supported CSS property, and each variants has a field with the property value. (The Rust types for values can be different for each property.) During the cascade, we get an sequence of declarations ordered by precedence, and we want to only keep one per property. We use `discriminant_value` to determine which property a given enum value represents.\n\nThere\u2019s already some code generation going on in this crate, so we could write a function or method that behaves similarly to `discriminant_value` and uses `match` internally, but I don\u2019t know if this would optimize as well. (This is used in a hot loop.)\n",

This has worked for me with several C-like enums (hand-checking the assembly output), so this might be a viable alternative if you do not want to wait for the stabilisation. Nonetheless I would recommend to verify if LLVM optimisations also work as intended in your case.\n",

    "body": "Servo update: **TL;DR** we\u2019re not blocked on stabilization anymore, but it\u2019d still be nice to have it eventually for debug build performance.\n\n---\n\nIn https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/11884 I\u2019ve worked around this being unavailable on stable with generated code like this:\n\n``` rust\nimpl PropertyDeclaration {\n    fn discriminant_value(&self) -> usize {\n        match *self {\n            PropertyDeclaration::AlignContent(..) => 0,\n            PropertyDeclaration::AlignItems(..) => 1,\n            PropertyDeclaration::AlignSelf(..) => 2,\n            // ...\n            PropertyDeclaration::ZIndex(..) => 147,\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd made a test crate to look at the generated code:\n\n``` rust\n#![feature(core_intrinsics)]\nextern crate style;\nuse std::intrinsics::discriminant_value;\n\npub fn with_match(decl: &style::properties::PropertyDeclaration) -> usize {\n    decl.discriminant_value()\n}\n\npub fn with_intrinsic(decl: &style::properties::PropertyDeclaration) -> usize {\n    unsafe { discriminant_value(decl) as usize }\n}\n```\n\nWith `cargo rustc --release -- --emit=llvm-ir`, this giant `match` compiles to something very close to `discriminant_value`:\n\n```\n; ModuleID = 'style_stable.0.rs'\ntarget datalayout = \"e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128\"\ntarget triple = \"x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\"\n\n%\"11.style::properties::PropertyDeclaration\" = type { i64, [0 x i64], [60 x i64] }\n\n; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind readonly uwtable\ndefine i64 @_ZN12style_stable10with_match17h5ee51730fa1d4ed4E(%\"11.style::properties::PropertyDeclaration\"* noalias nocapture readonly dereferenceable(488)) unnamed_addr #0 {\nentry-block:\n  %.idx = getelementptr %\"11.style::properties::PropertyDeclaration\", %\"11.style::properties::PropertyDeclaration\"* %0, i64 0, i32 0\n  %.idx.val = load i64, i64* %.idx, align 8\n  ret i64 %.idx.val\n}\n\n; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind readonly uwtable\ndefine i64 @_ZN12style_stable14with_intrinsic17h38553922905ee296E(%\"11.style::properties::PropertyDeclaration\"* noalias nocapture readonly dereferenceable(488)) unnamed_addr #0 {\nentry-block:\n  %1 = getelementptr inbounds %\"11.style::properties::PropertyDeclaration\", %\"11.style::properties::PropertyDeclaration\"* %0, i64 0, i32 0\n  %2 = load i64, i64* %1, align 8, !range !0\n  ret i64 %2\n}\n\nattributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind readonly uwtable }\n\n!0 = !{i64 0, i64 129}\n```\n\nBut without `--release` the `.ll` file is 6843 lines long, so I\u2019m guessing the giant `match` expression takes O(n variants) time in debug mode. Since this is used in a hot function, this might still affect performance of debug builds (which are already slow).\n",

I would argue that extracting the discriminant does not break parametricity, as it's nothing you couldn't do with a giant `match`.\n\nYou can't do a giant `match` on a generic type parameter `T`. But without a `Reflect` bound, you could invoke `discriminant_value` on it. That's what a parametricity violation is.\n\n> What it actually needs is a `T: Enum` bound, but we don't have that.\n\nThat might actually be the best thing. With `T: Reflect` it'd be saying \"figure out whether this type is an `enum`, and if so, give me its discriminant, otherwise just give me `0`\". There's not necessarily any real _harm_ in being able to call it on something that isn't an `enum`, but it's a bit loose. With `T: Enum` it'd be saying \"make sure to give me a type that's actually an `enum`, and I'll give you its discriminant\". That's a bit nicer, and it'd let us sidestep the question of whether it even makes sense to have a `Reflect` still. (In a world with specialization, it's almost surely doomed, but awkwardly, that's not in stable yet, while `discriminant_value` would be.) It would _also_ let us cleanly solve the issue of different `enum`s having different discriminant types, by giving the `Enum` trait an associated type.\n",

    "body": "So I'm working on implementing this. There are several routes for implementation:\n- Just re-export the intrinsinc.\n  - This requires stabilizing the intrinsic, which makes it possible to import by mistake from `std::intrinsics`, because neither rustdoc nor rustc consider the stability of the parent module (but they are supposed to, so opinions differ on whether this really counts as stabilization).\n  - This comes with the possibility of implementing a magic check that the `T` is an enum, even though there's no bound in the type signature. This would be similar to the magic same-size check for `transmute`.\n  - There's no need for a `Reflect` bound because you will never be able to call `T::discriminant_value()` in a generic context anyway.\n- Write a wrapper function.\n  - This does not require stabilizing the intrinsic.\n  - We can't put in a magic check because the wrapper function would need to be generic and could never pass the check. The return value for non-enums would be unspecified.\n  - We could put in a `Reflect` bound, but I really don't see the need for it.\n\nI'm currently planning on naming the re-export or wrapper `std::raw::discriminant`. This requires stabilizing `std::raw` (but its contents, currently only `TraitObject`, can be destabilized under the same feature gate).\n",

    "body": "@durka it seems like we can still do that if we want; I personally find it a feature, not a bug, that this works for values of any type. In particular, when you think about \"algebraic data types\" in a more abstract way, structs (and really any \"single value\" sort of type) is really just a special case of enums where there happens to be only one variant. This is why e.g. haskell calls both of them just `data`. So it feels natural to me that we would just return `0` in the case of a non-enum.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Well, not *0*, but some \"sentinel\" value.",

    "body": "I know this issue has already been closed, and the function is on track for stabilization, but I thought I should bring this up anyway since it seems odd to me: `mem::discriminant` returns 0 for all non-enums, _including enum constructors_. That is, the following code prints `0` and then `1`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::mem;\r\n\r\nenum MyEnum {\r\n    First,\r\n    Second(i32)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", mem::discriminant(&MyEnum::Second)); // prints `0`\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", mem::discriminant(&MyEnum::Second(2))); // prints `1`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMO, it'd be nice to have the discriminant of the enum constructor match the discriminant of the enum value. I'm not sure if I've missed the boat here, but this seems like it would be really valuable for getting the discriminant without having to fully construct a value (this doesn't work for struct constructors, but that's something we could revisit).",

    "body": "In theory we can change that since the docs say the return value for\nnon-enums is unspecified.
