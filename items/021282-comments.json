The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Nice! Can you add the test from #21264 as well to make sure we don't regress on the performance again? It should hopefully time out the test suite or set off _some_ alarm if it goes back to the way it was.\n\nIt may also be worth leaving a comment why we're using `zero_mem` for everything (including small values).\n\nAs a final bit, I'm not sure how much this matters, but non-optimized builds which use `mem::zeroed` for a small scalar get translated to an immediate constant 0, but this causes them to allocate a stack slot, call `memset`, and then load it. I don't think the `mem::zeroed` intrinsic is too close to a hot loop though, so this probably doesn't matter too much.\n",

Instead it would create the stack slot, store a constant 0 and then load the value from that slot. This just changes that middle step to a call to `memset` instead. This _might_ be slightly slower in the case of small immediate, but is much, much faster for large values (which are also more likely to be used with `mem::zeroed`)\n",
