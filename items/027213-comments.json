If you pass `&mut Vec<T>` to any function then it will be faster 100% of the time if you pre-allocate space, so in that sense there's nothing special about these I/O functions. It's generally common knowledge that a vector which doesn't have to resize is faster than one that does.\n\nIn that sense I'm not sure this note is really needed?\n",
