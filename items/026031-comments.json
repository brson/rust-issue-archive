    "body": "This is definitely a breaking change to the crates.io libc crate which needs to be considered. We can signal this with a semver-incompatible version bump (e.g. moving to 0.2), but I would personally rather hold off on making these sorts of breaking changes until we have a more comprehensive design for liblibc. I think that \"just removing all the function definitions\" and not dealing with the types, for example, may not be the best way to approach this. \n\nCould you elaborate on the rationale for this? I'm interested to hear what you think the long-term story for these bindings to be.\n\ncc @rust-lang/libs \n",

    "body": "The rationale is that `libc` is not trying to be a wrapper to WinAPI. Most of the WinAPI in `libc` was added so that it could be used in Rust. Considering the current policy is to put new WinAPI in `std::sys::windows::c` rather than `libc`, it seemed like a good idea to clean out all the existing WinAPI from `libc`.\n\nI'm not really sure how I envision `libc`'s future since it is trying to be multiple things at once, like libc bindings and posix bindings, but neither is it attempting to include everything possible. The things in `libc` are a conglomerate of whatever was needed for Rust at some point in time, and are by no means comprehensive. For people who want posix and linux APIs there's things like `nix`, and for people who want WinAPI there is `winapi`.\n\nI only did functions for now as more of a proof of concept to get feedback. I'd be happy to handle types and constants as well in this PR if doing everything at once is a better idea rather than splitting it up.\n",

    "body": "I definitely agree that the design of liblibc needs to be re-thought, but I don't want to hastily go into a situation we're not prepared for. I think at this time we're not prepared for a sharding like @nagisa mentions, and I agree that this is leading towards that direction. \n\nThe alternative that I can think of is to continue the direction of liblibc being a \"this is the system's API interface\" kind of crate. There's definitely pros and cons in both directions, but it's something at least to consider.\n",
