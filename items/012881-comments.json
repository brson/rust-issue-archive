Here's my progress so far: https://github.com/hannobraun/rust/commit/2f2ac5de204e1abf3f3371b4c772123d018742e2\n\nI haven't tested this yet and haven't even run a full make check so far. Unfortunately I don't seem to have enough RAM in this machine to work while running the Rust build in the background, so I can't finish today.\n\nI'll get back to it and send a pull request as soon as I can! (might be a week or two though, lots to do)\n",
