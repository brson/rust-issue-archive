    "body": "I think that `getcwd` and `change_dir` are probably OK to return `IoResult`, but for `setenv` and `unsetenv` I would rather not return `IoResult` as they are quite common to call. The \"insufficient memory\" use case panicking is aligned mostly with our \"OOM == abort\" behavior today, and I would suspect that the number of invalid names is rare enough that it would be more ergonomic to panic instead of returning an `IoResult`.\n\nI'm also thinking that there may be a better error to expose here than `IoResult` because it's more of an OS error than an \"IO error\", but we just don't have a good abstraction for that today. For now I think it's ok to use `IoResult`, but certainly something interesting to think about! cc @aturon \n",
