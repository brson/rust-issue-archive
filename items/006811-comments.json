    "body": "@pcwalton and I talked about a design where the sandboxing `spawn` takes an `extern \"Rust\" fn` and does a fork + self-exec while passing the address of that function to the new process in an env var or something.  Then the new process will start there rather than `main`.\n\nThis wouldn't have a shared exchange heap; instead you'd have a port/chan variant that uses UNIX pipes or something.  The ability to send file descriptors through UNIX-domain sockets is potentially useful.\n\nThe killer demo here is something like\n\n``` .rs\ndo spawn {\n    unsafe {\n        vulnerable_c_lib(shellcode);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRun it and pop a shell.  Then change `spawn` to `spawn_seccomp`, and watch the spawn'd process get `SIGKILL` and the parent see a usual task failure.\n",
