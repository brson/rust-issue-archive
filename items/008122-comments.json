    "body": "Well, Haskell exposes members explicitly, as does Node. Java asks for\nexplicit private/public members, as does C++.\n\nI think there's a good case, not only in language precedent but as a\ngeneral good practice, that public members should be explicitly tagged as\nsuch. It also creates a slight amount of mental friction when deciding to\nmake a member public. IMO, this is good; you actually have to reason at\nleast a tiny bit when you expose a member, which generally leads to\nmore succinct and better-designed interfaces (much like immutability forces\nyou to reason about correctness in a way that mutable-everything does not).\n\nOn Tue, Jul 30, 2013 at 4:06 AM, Alex Crichton notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Now that you can't really put pub at the top-level of things like\n> impl/extern/trait, you don't need the priv keyword to control method\n> visibility of various items because they're all private by default.\n> \n> pros:\n> - I think that this would really simplify public/private because\n>   there's one and only one rule: private by default, public if you flag it\n> - one less keyword!\n> \n> difficulties:\n> - Right now this is the only way to make struct fields private.

    "body": "I believe that the main case holding back making fields private-by-default is the simple:\n\n```\npub struct Point { x: int, y: int }\n```\n\nThat's particularly easy to read, and if you compare it to\n\n```\npub struct Point { pub x: int, pub y: int }\n```\n\nIt's a little more verbose. This is an obvious consequence of private-by-default fields, but it's also unfortunate to regress in this simple example. We haven't decided yet whether this is an acceptable regression. Some attempts were made to make this syntax concise as well, and most of them focused on changing the declaration of the struct to say \"I want my fields public by default\". In this case, a normal `struct` would be private by default, and you would have to explicitly opt-in to having public-by-default fields.\n\nWe didn't really reach any good conclusions in this case, and as a result this sort of stagnated and stopped making progress. This is high up on my agenda of things to bring up at meetings, however, and I think that I'll get around to this at the next one.\n",

    "body": "> (alexcrichton) I would be ok with pub enum makes all variants public, while enum implies all variants are private. That's one of the sticky points of removing priv because then you can't have a mixture of public/private enum variants.\n\nI checked with the folks in #haskell to make sure, and I don't think there's any use case for having a mixture of public and private variants. For constructing the type, which is usually what you care about, you can just use functions, so the question hinges on pattern matching. Does anyone else see a reason why you might want to let clients check for particular variants via pattern matching but not others (and therefore be required to use `_` in every `match` for exhaustiveness)?\n\nIf that's so, then I think there's three inter-related questions left:\n1. _Do enum variants inherit their visibility from the enum, or do they default to private and require @pnkfelix's `pub:` syntax to be made public?_ A public abstract datatype with many private variants _does_ have use cases. If enum variants inherit visibility, then that can still be expressed by wrapping the enum in a newtype struct, it's just more annoying. While if variants default to private, then having to write `pub:` when you want them public is annoying.\n2. _Do we require `pub:` for tuple-like structs as well?_ [See my previous comment.] Having to write `pub:` is annoying, but otherwise, there's no way to have a tuple-like struct with private fields, and a lightweight way to have a public type with private data is one of the primary motivations for newtypes.\n3. _What about enum variants' fields?_ This interacts with both of the previous points. For struct-like enum variants, if the variants inherit their visibility, then do the fields also inherit it, or do they default to private? If the fields also inherit visibility, then it's inconsistent with structs, where they default to private; if they default to private, then it's yet another place you have to write `pub:` (and this would presumably also be the case if the variants default to private). If we say \"yes\" to `2.`, then the same thing applies to tuple-like variants as well.\n",

I don't think that makes any sense.) (See also some [related thoughts](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-March/008836.html) from the ML.)\n\nEdit: To summarize, I would like to support:\n- Structs with all fields public, or with all fields private\n- Tuple structs with all fields public, or with all fields private\n- Enums with all variants (and all fields thereof) public, or with all variants private\n\nWhat I _don't_ want to support:\n- Enums with some variants public, and others private\n- Enums with public variants with private fields\n\nI'm mostly indifferent as to whether we support:\n- Structs with some fields public, and others private\n\nThis makes thinking about syntax a bit easier, but there's still no obvious winner.\n",
