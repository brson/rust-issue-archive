I think it could be linted against (see rust-clippy cc @Manishearth), but doing something about it in the compiler it is a nontrivial decision and is unlikely to happen.\n\nAFAIR, the promise of `unsafe` is \u201cwhen crashed due to memory safety issue, code which caused the issue is inside unsafe block\u201d which isn\u2019t technically incorrect in this case, but might be relevant when such broken function comes from an external crate.\n\nJust seeing a safe function taking a raw pointer as parameter would ring a 150dB alarm in my head.\n",

The compiler is in the best position to verify this particular one. In the C world, helping programmers notice code which is valid but can lead to correctness issues is what warnings are for.\n\nI'm surprised by the hostility to this idea. There seems to be a feeling in the rust community that 'unsafe' means \"you're on your own\". I'd like to write only safe rust all the time too, but being a systems language means that's not always possible, and it doesn't help me solve my problems or feel welcome in the community. If you find yourself thinking this way, please reconsider.\n\nDo you have a more concrete argument against adding a warning? An example where there would be false positives, for example?\n",

    "body": "> An example where there would be false positives, for example?\n\nBasically, all of them. Most of the use cases where you _would_ use unsafe involve sprinklings of raw pointers.\n\nIn other words, such a warning would almost be like a warning for \"hey, you're using unsafe\". Which makes it pretty useless, since you're already opting in to something when you use `unsafe`; you shouldn't have to opt in to more or less the same thing with an `allow()` attribute. It would feel like the compiler is going \"Are you sure? Ok, you are. But are you really, _really_ sure?\".\n\n> There seems to be a feeling in the rust community that 'unsafe' means \"you're on your own\".\n\nThe moment you start using unsafe, it's pretty clear that there are other complex external factors in play at the moment. At that point, it's hard to use static analysis to figure out anything special about the code because the analysis knows nothing about these factors. Even just warning on an unconditional dereference of a raw pointer is dubious -- plenty of cases when the raw pointer is known to be allocated (of course this reasoning only works for private functions).\n",

    "body": "It seems strange to me too, that this idea has no support, maybe people misunderstand your point?\nBasically every public (!) function taking raw pointers as arguments and going to dereference them has a contract - the input pointer is valid. But it can't _rely_ on this contract if it's safe, so it can never dereference this pointer!\nPrivate functions can rely on some extra knowledge about invariants, because unsafety is module level, as was mentioned, so they can dereference the pointer based on this knowledge.\n\nIMO this would be a very useful warning with near 100% error-detection rate if applied to immutable arguments on public functions.\n",
