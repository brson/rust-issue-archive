  "body": "Middle clicking is usually used for opening a link in a new tab in most browsers. It's an easy way to navigate without losing your current page.\n\nWhen using rustdoc's search, I'd like to be able to middle-click on search results so that I can open multiple results in new tabs. However, currently the `onclick` listener captures middle clicks too, so link opens in two places \u2014 in a new tab, and on the same page.\n\nThis partially fixes it. It would be better if the anchor tag on a result spanned the entire result path+name, and not just the name -- while normal clicking still works due to the event handler, middle clicking is broken if you click on something other than the result name (not the path). I don't mind doing it that way, but it seems like there was a reason behind having the `a` tag only cover the name.
