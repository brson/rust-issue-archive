    "body": "(Sorry about commenting on a closed issue, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have been moved to the RFCs repo yet.) The motivation for this convention as stated in the description seems to me like it applies to non-tuple structs, too. If the old `Unique`, without a marker field, were defined as a non-tuple struct instead, as so\u2026\n\n``` rust\npub struct Unique<T: ?Sized> {\n    pub ptr: *mut T,\n}\n```\n\n\u2026how would that be any better forward-compatibility-wise? Adding a field (private or not) would still break code that constructs or pattern-matches on it. This seems to be exactly the same situation as for tuple structs. The main problem here as I see it is with privacy\u2014the `ptr` field should be private\u2014but tuple structs can have private fields too.\n\nI understand that there is a problem that exists with tuple structs (even with private fields) about polluting the value namespace as well as the type one, but that seems like a relatively minor problem that doesn\u2019t affect backward-compatibility. I\u2019ve filed rust-lang/rfcs#902 as a way of solving that for tuple structs with private fields.\n",
