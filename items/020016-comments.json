Your build process [uses `--emit=obj`](https://github.com/ckkashyap/unix/blob/master/kernel/Makefile#L26), but that does not include dependencies such as libcore. You'll want to build your kernel as a staticlib (`--crate-type=staticlib`) and then link the generated archive via `ld` instead of dealing with object files directly.\n\nThanks for the issue though!\n",
