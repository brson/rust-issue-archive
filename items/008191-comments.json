    "body": "This is actually working as intended. As is documented in the manual, all paths referenced from `use` statements must be crate-relative, not module relative. For code like this to compile, it must be of the form:\n\n``` rust\n#[cfg(test)]         \nmod test {           \n    extern mod extra;\n    use self::extra::test; \n}                    \n```\n\nArguably the error could be improved upon noticing that the name `extra` is already in scope of the current module, but it's difficult because of the interdependency of resolving imports at the same time that you're suggesting others.\n\nI'm going to leave this open for now (because the error message can certainly be improved).\n",
