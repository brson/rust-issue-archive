    "body": "Do you know what the intended use of `int` is? It has the same size as `uint`, which is always large enough to represent a pointer. However, I don't think anyone uses `int` to represent pointers. So unlike `uint`, it does not have a clear use case.\n\nMachines with 64-bit pointers often have 64-bit arithmetic, in which using `i64` is not as expensive as on machines with 32-bit arithmetic only.\nHowever, I think they do not always have 64-bit arithmetic, so this is not reliable.\n\nIf `int` was guaranteed to have 64 bits if a corresponding arithmetic is available, it could be useful.\nIn its current state, I can't think of a case where you would want to use `int`.\nIt seems to me that it is currently used when people don't care whether it is an `i32` or `i64`. (At least that is how I use it.) Unfortunately that leads to unnecessarily platform-dependent code.\n\nI think the most sensible default to use would be `i32`, because this should give decent performance on most modern platforms.\n",

    "body": "@steveklabnik \nThis issue is independent of whether `int` becomes the \"fallback\" type, no? It's what type should the guide use.\n\nJust recently, I pointed a friend to [the guide](http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html). He's a systems/embedded programmer (one of the reasons I suggested Rust), and the first thing he asked was what the size of `int` was. When I explained, he immediately understood what a \"pointer-sized integer\" meant, but he felt the guide's examples were wrong since they exclusively used this type, and seemed to suggest it was for general data.\n\n_Having_ a pointer sized integer isn't confusing. Even calling it `int` isn't a problem. What is confusing is not documenting it as such. Having fixed-width types like `i8`, `u8`, `i16`, `u16`, `i32`, `u32`, `i64`, and `u64` is a key feature of Rust, and some of these should be displayed in the guide. When the guide talks about subscripting an array, just mention that `int` is pointer-sized, and used for indexes, lengths, sizes, and offsets, analogous to `size_t` and `intptr_t` in C.\n\n@vks\n\n> Also, a lot of people will learn Rust when 1.0 is released, so it would be good if they are not taught soon-to-be-deprecated habits like using int instead of fixed size integers.\n> Agreed, the guide should be using a fixed-width integer.\n\nSo, can we have a PR changing most of the `int`s in the Guide to `i32`s or `i64`s?\n",

    "body": "@steveklabnik Excellent. Cheers!\n\nBTW, the Guide might want to say what `i32` means when first using it.\n\nIs there a doc on Rust's type inference?\n\n@alexchandel No disrespect intended for my fellow programmers. It's not about intelligence. It's about design complexity & usability, busy people, project time pressures, limited working memory, using many languages on a daily basis, and jumping to conclusions.\n\nTo take one example, I've had fellow Google engineers not know about key Java facts like precise exceptions (which enables portability but severely limits code motion optimizations), which primitives are atomic in read/write, or how to write bounded generics. How many programmers have read the language spec of the languages they use?\n\nBack to Rust, there have been many uses of `int` and `uint` where a non-portable integer type is inappropriate such as integer shift and rotate counts, basic math operations, and binary I/O.\n",
