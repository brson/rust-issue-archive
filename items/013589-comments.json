    "body": "It seems that we are currently not checking for the error of `CreateThread` API call in the `std::rt::thread::imp::create` function. Spawning too many threads causes the invalid handle that is caught by `CloseHandle` much later. Pretty bad.\n\n@mdinger By the way, the default runtime (libnative) is not designed for spawning lots of tasks. Consider using libgreen for that; [the runtime guide](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/guide-runtime.html) will give more information about what is a runtime and how you can switch it.\n",
