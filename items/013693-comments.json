    "body": "@brson: There's a section in the module documentation about what volatile means in this context, but we don't seem to have a way of making a link back up to it via markdown. It mentions LLVM because I copied the documentation from the non-volatile versions and added the line at the end.\n\nI agree it should be fixed, but I don't really think it has to be done here. I'd rather just document these in `std::ptr` and hide these inside a private module there.\n\nIt's being added because people have been asking for a way to do a secure erase due to the OpenSSL furore. These are much more efficient than using the existing volatile_load/volatile_store since LLVM is forbidden from joining multiple volatile stores/loads into a volatile memset/memmove/memcpy. There are other use cases like interacting with hardware too.\n",
