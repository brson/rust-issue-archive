    "body": "I'm not sure that this is the best way to go about doing this. This makes `BufferedReader` a little faster, but what about `MemReader` and `BufReader`? What about anything implementing the `Buffer` trait?\n\nI would believe that this is a perf improvement, but I also believe that this needs more thought as to whether it's necessary and if so, how to extend it to code beyond just a buffered reader.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the quick review. It indeed doesn't address `MemReader`, nor all the `Reader`s at all, but my Rust knowledge is admittedly not large enough to come up with any nicer approach (or just any sane approach maybe).\n\nOn one side `Reader::read` must work with a large range of user-chunk sizes, on the other side there're a few situations (e.g u8, u16, u32, u64) where shortcuts are possible/desirable.\n\nI would however be whiling to explore any lead you may have.\n",
