  "body": "Borrowed strings have one indirection less than other strings. With the matched expression, an extra Load was done. With patterns, constant strings weren't Store/Load as needed.\n\nI add a test: src/test/run-pass/alt-borrowed_str.rs\n\nI start watching rust 2 weeks ago. Even if I did my best to make something consistent, the LLVM generator is quite hard to understand: I may have miss something. Please, before merging, check I didn't break the model.\n",
