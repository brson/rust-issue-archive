    "body": "The issue with the snapshots is that in stage0 there are lots of warnings emitted. There may also be an issue where copiletest fails to build.\n\nThe way to solve these is by having the crates properly declare that they are using unstable features. Once they do that the makefiles will no longer need to do the bootstrap hack for -dev, -nightly or -snapshot builds. This fix is done in my followup [feature staging PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21248), but since that will take some days to land I will prepare another such patch to help get this snapshot landed.\n",
