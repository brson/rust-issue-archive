    "body": "Man now I'm wishing github didn't have all those links to commits which referenced this, oh well! Some thoughts for stabilization:\n- The names `alloc_system` and `alloc_jemalloc` aren't stable, and we may not want to stabilize them. Can we get away providing no stable allocators by default?\n- The allocation symbols all have funky names (leading `__rust` prefixes). It'd be nice if you instead tagged a function as \"this is the allocator malloc function\" and then the compiler would automatically wire it to the right symbol name.\n- The allocation functions are not typechecked, and along the line of the previous bullet it would be nice if the functions were tagged to be typechecked.\n\nI don't think these are necessarily blocks for stabilization, nothing will work unless the symbols are right and the signatures match, so I would consider it backwards compatible to add compiler verification at a later date. Otherwise this is such a low-level feature that expecting you to read some docs or look at some examples seems not totally unreasonable.\n",

    "body": "I'm not sure if this is the right thread or https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1974 is the right thread???\r\n\r\nWow this has been painful trying to understand where this is landing (Yay! Lets read like hundreds of github comments, a few PRs, and some out dated docs to try to understand how to do something a systems language should do in it sleep... allocate memory). From this thread it seems like its now been adopted as some sort of trait based allocator with `#[global_allocator]` ???\r\n\r\nI'm *trying* and *failing* to implement a [Darwin/MacOS KEXT](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/Extend.html) with rust. Here's the lonely [rust file](https://github.com/wmiller848/Warden/blob/master/WardenKext/WardenKext/Warden.rs) and its sister [c glue file](https://github.com/wmiller848/Warden/blob/master/WardenKext/WardenKext/WardenKext.c) I've been hacking around with (not a lot to show for a few days of work... at least I can stack allocate and print from the kernel in rust \ud83c\udf8a  )\r\n\r\nMy initial goal of plugging rust into the [IOMalloc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1575326-iomalloc) and [IOFree](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1575290-iofree?language=objc) methods provided by the Darwin kernel seemed like a straight forward task but oh how I've been wrong. I mean who doesn't want nice `Box` syntax and ergonomic allocation / free when writing in rust?!? (yes I realize the kernel has special constraints on lifetimes and timings of things, but in principle rust should be able to plug into its alloc / free mechanisms)\r\n\r\nPointing back to some *stable* docs from a few release ago https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.16.0/book/custom-allocators.html it seemed straight froward enough, of course including `#![feature]` gated things in the stable docs is asinine as \"features\" are inherently unstable (why were these docs even in a stable release??? Because you know `#[feature] may not be used on the stable release channel`).\r\n\r\nCurrent nightly (`nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin - rustc 1.21.0-nightly (52a330969 2017-07-27)`) of course after [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1974) merge and [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/42727) has removed the `#![allocator]` feature in favor of `global_allocator` and `default_lib_allocator`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0557]: feature has been removed\r\n#![feature(allocator)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, so clearly there is some frustration here trying to understand the state of things.\r\n\r\n*Really* all I'm seeking is what is the most *stable* way for a `no_std`, no `libc` rust program making use of a kernel provided alloc/fee to plug into the correct allocation handlers? The last [comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1974#issuecomment-317124097) on the previous PR leave me very confused.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can gather I need to follow something like this https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/42727/files#diff-e3210055d7c3792841be2a5c1ba9b5b0 except of course my target being a `no_std` environment seems to make this 100x more painful.\r\n\r\nAny pointers are greatly appropriated.

Example: [alloc.rs.txt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/files/1253898/alloc.rs.txt). The `global_allocator` attribute expands to code containing `use super::<varname>` but I don't know why rustc fails to resolve that in that case. Happens with both inline and file modules.

In this case, replacing the global allocator is not a workable option. Instead, you need to pass in an instance of an Alloc to each collection for which you want a custom allocator.\r\nTBD\r\n\r\nIs the api finished, i.e. could I use it right now if i have a look how the current allocators are implemented?\r\n\r\nAnd a more grave question: if the Alloc trait resides in `std::heap`, can we use it in `#![no_std]` crates?

    "body": "@SimonSapin (comming from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32838#issuecomment-341877578)\r\n\r\n> What do you think would be a non-awful way to select the global allocator?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ezyang/thesis/releases/download/rev20170925/main.pdf That is an *implemented* PhD thesis retrofitting the needed functionality onto Haskell + Cabal. It is not be hard to tweak the design for Rust + Cabal. Indeed the end goal isn't even so new to that thesis, but is an old ML thing. The \"retrofitting onto existing language\" part is new however, and exactly what *would* have been the hard part, except the thesis + implementation war stories demolish it. There is no hard part left, our work is entirely cut out for us.\r\n\r\nThe list of things that would use this includes:\r\n\r\n - liblog logging implementation\r\n - panic printing implementation (as opposed to unwind vs abort, a codegen not library distinction)\r\n - \"framework libraries\" providing `main` shims (i.e. library has undef function and defines main, crate root defines the other function).\r\n - global allocator\r\n\r\n(buried in other threads I think I might have longer lists.)\r\n\r\nThe underlying (anti-)pattern here is singletons / ambient authority---this things are iffy so it's great in general that the trait system pushes us away from them. But, for the use-cases above, there isn't a pure-trait solution that anyone has found.\r\n\r\nCrucially, global allocation is an *unremarkable* example of this. It's 100% a library issue, not language issue. (We do have misc language support for allocation, but that boils down to use of the global allocator, not the definition of it.) There's no special case.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I shouldn't be saying this as I already have many other open source and even Rust obligations (foremost https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1133), but you all could successfully conscript me to distill that thesis into an RFC for Rust :).\r\n\r\nCC @aturon ",

Very briefly:\r\n\r\n1.  In Rust, can do things like\r\n    ```rust\r\n    abstract mod FooBarBaz {\r\n       // Acts a lot like proposed `abstract type`\r\n       // (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2071-impl-trait-type-alias.md)\r\n       type Foo;\r\n\r\n       // Acts a lot like lang item / `extern { static FOO: Foo }`\r\n       static FOO: Foo; \r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. In `Cargo.toml` for crate with abstract modules, declare abstract modules by path\r\n\r\n3. Dependencies can (but need not) have their abstract modules instantiated with something concrete. The design fundamentally allows for the same crate can be instantiated two different ways, too, though our use-cases may not benefit from this\r\n    ```toml\r\n    [dependencies]\r\n    alloc_system = \"*\"\r\n    alloc_jemalloc = \"*\"\r\n    alloc_with_system = { name = \"alloc\", requires = { \"x::y\" = \"alloc_system::global_allocator\" } }\r\n    alloc_with_jemalloc = { name = \"alloc\", requires = { \"x::y\" = \"alloc_jemalloc::global_allocator\" } }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Cargo solver figures exact plan of instantiation (this mirrors the public/private dep rules in terms of ensuring unified dependencies must be instantiated the same way).\r\n\r\n5. `rustc` is given this exact plan, so it need do that sort of solving / global (multi-crate) coherence checking. Also this is a bone for non-Cargo Rust users not being completely stuck.",

    "body": "@aturon\r\n\r\n> Are you proposing that there's no design work needed to incorporate the SML module system into Rust?\r\n\r\nWell, it's not all SML verbatim, but that's a good thing. Haskell and Rust and both languages with traits / type classes first and foremost, so the thesis is both answering what's feasible and what makes aesthetic sense. I'm still reading, but my prior knowledge of the work leads me to say \"basically no\".\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference I see so far is that in Haskell modules are not namespaced per library/package/crate. So unlike my sketch above, \"abstract crates\" as opposed to \"abstract modules\" might be the most natural translation. \r\n\r\n> And that the issues around Cabal in Backpack would be the same as for Cargo?\r\n\r\nAgain I need to finish reading, but I don't anticipate any. In fact, our private-public dependency division anticipates some of this work (Cabal only has public dependencies).\r\n\r\n> There are important use-cases not adequately addressed by this feature.\r\n\r\nI worry that if we attack each bullet point I list separately, some will never get addressed---stuck in low priority limbo. I think this feature will also probably be necessary for breaking up `std` into smaller libraries, though that's a hard argument to demonstrate short of actually doing it.\r\n\r\n> The changes you have in mind can be done in a low-cost way (or at any rate, the cost is commensurate with the size/importance of the use case).\r\n\r\nIf there is design work, it's probably in finding even more minimal subsets of Backpack. I concede your point about stabilization; even if everything does port over flawlessly, it's still a big change so one we'd probably want to stabilize slowly and incremental.\r\n\r\n> There's no forward-compatible way to address the missing use cases.\r\n\r\nMaybe an ad-hoc attribute *is* the right stop-gap (!), but I'd be more comfortable if we knew how it fit into the larger picture. Yes, we didn't block `impl trait` on abstract types, but at least we sketched something out.\r\n\r\nQuite frankly, `#[global_allocator]` was not designed by the lang team, and I doubt anyone currently knows the full semantics of it. Abstraction sealing in the presence of dependency cycles as can occur today (e.g. your allocator depends on liballoco) is not trivial stuff.",

    "body": "@rfcbot concern indirection overhead\r\n\r\n(Does this still work after FCP has ended?)\r\n\r\nThe way this works at the moment is that [`Heap::alloc`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.24.1/src/liballoc/heap.rs#L84-L86) for example calls a function declaration [`extern \"Rust\" { fn __rust_alloc(\u2026) -> \u2026; }`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.24.1/src/liballoc/heap.rs#L31).\r\n\r\nWhen `#[global_allocator]` is used, it expands to roughly (I\u2019m glossing over handling of different defaults in cdylib/staticlib vs executables) code that defines this function `extern fn __rust_alloc(\u2026) -> \u2026 { \u2026 }`. This indirection (or something like it) is necessary because the allocator may be defined in a crate downstream of liballoc.\r\n\r\nDo we have a clear idea of what is the performance overhead of this indirection? It definitely prevents inlining. (I think.) Does it have a cost similar to a virtual call to a trait object\u2019s method? How significant is this cost in practice? Are we ready to stabilize a design that make this cost unavoidable? (Or is it avoidable?)",

LTO is nice, but it's very expensive, so most programs are not compiled with LTO--it's a huge hammer for attacking this problem, and isn't actually necessary today.  Moreover, relying excessively on LTO for performance runs counter to the goal of improving Rust's compilation speed for optimized builds.  Allocation is a huge hotspot for many programs, and I don't think we should reduce allocation performance in a way that can only be recovered with compiler magic that people rarely enable.",

    "body": "> I don't think we should reduce allocation performance in a way that can only be recovered with compiler magic that people rarely enable\r\n\r\nI think what would help is if `cargo` had another build flag other than just `--debug` and `--release`, something like that `--publish` that you do when you are actually going to publish and distribute a binary to a larger audience than simply your development machine. In those cases, the extra build time for the final set up optimizations that should be turned on for this case like LTO (and I think I read somewhere the number of code gen units that is default also hurts optimizations a little?). If a build server is what publishes the binary, the extra time waiting for these optimizations for a published release is even less of a problem.\r\n\r\nThe way it is now, if you want LTO you have to enable it for all release builds, included \"development\" release builds you are just building and running to test our some performance intensive piece of the software.",
