    "body": "I also think that there are only 4 allocations remaining:\n- `proc()` for `task::spawn` - I think this is required no matter what\n- `~Task` - we may be able to put the `Task` at the top of the stack rather than allocating on the heap. This would be difficult.\n- `~GreenTask` - I think this could follow the same strategy as `Task` by allocating it at the top of the stack, but again, very difficult and dubiously worth it.\n- `~Registers` - apparently this is needed to align registers to 16-bytes. This should not be necessary at all to have an allocation here.\n",
