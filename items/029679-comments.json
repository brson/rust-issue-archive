(os error 5)`. When I kill the process (the .exe that was running with the working `cargo run`), I can then do a `cargo run` and it works successfully.\n\nI am using ctrl+c to exit the process, however closing the terminal window doesn't seem to fix the issue.\n\nI just wanted to add that since the process is still running, after I ctrl+c my iron test project that I'm playing with, I can still access the site and it still prints to the console that I closed it from.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178752/13071273/f7d2fa18-d457-11e5-8960-a1df3246d8ac.png)\n",
