  "body": "A really basic REPL, using liblinenoise. Also adds linenoise bindings into libcore, as core::rl.\n\nIssues out of my control:\n- There could only be one parser context at a time, so the entire rustc has to be started up each time in a task (has this been fixed since then?)\n- AST is not sendable, so I had to (hackily) pretty print each parsed AST and then send it back to the REPL context - results in performance degrading over time\n- Unused variable warnings can't be disabled so it's incredibly in your face\n\nBig thanks to @bleibig, @dbp, etc. for their work on REPL prototypes.\n",
