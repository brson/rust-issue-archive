    "body": "> I vaguely recall parallel codegen was broken due to duplicate symbols or something\n\nThe specific issue in question I believe was https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18243, but I don't think that a small reproduction was ever generated. I do think, however, that `-C codegen-units=N` is broken today on master so this might enable it to work in stage1+. It also depends on what linker you're using I think... (fun times!)\n\n> Hmm, probably checking for a symbol and registering one with LLVM at the same time (with a global lock, probably) and then using the registered ValueRef everywhere in trans would be a better choice overall. That would make parallel codegen correct as well at least wrt symbol clashes.\n\nNote that the parallel part of parallel codegen is only the LLVM passes. We continue to translate the entire AST serially, the strategy was just to round-robin translations into one of N LLVM contexts. Each context is then independently serialize.\n\nAlong those lines it should be possible to have a shared global context (I think this already exists?) which keeps track of symbol names with unsynchronized access (as all translation is done serially).\n\n> Objects produced by those contexts are merged during linking which either fails or does nothing sensible in presence of duplicate symbols.\n\nI believe this is indeed the problem! In theory though we should never be producing duplicate symbols. If I remember correctly it was one of our own compiler-generated symbols, not a user-input symbols (so this may not help too too much).\n\n---\n\n> I published this PR mainly as RFC, because I\u2019m not sure about approach taken here, and want to hear people\u2019s involved with trans thoughts in general.\n\nI think this is a great idea! We've run into so may bugs in the past of duplicate names in codegen and they're always nasty and terrible to both find and fix.\n\nI think the strategy taken here is relatively ok, but I would prefer to see the calls to functions like `LLVMAddGlobal` or `register_fn` to all get funneled through one common location. This one common location could then keep track of the symbols previously registered (and may pick up more instances here and there. Basically, if we're going to add this, I think we will want it to be as robust as possible which means pushing it as far down into the LLVM stack as possible.\n",
