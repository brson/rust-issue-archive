    "body": "Closing, sadly this isn't something that we can do at the frontend level. For components inside of one `LLVMContext`, you cannot parallelize their usage manually by running pass managers on separate cores. LLVM is built to be parallel at the granularity of the `LLVMContext` layer right now, but not within (too much shared state).\n\nThe real solution for something like this was the changeset that Intel was pushing, but even that was only parallelizing the codegen passes, not the optimization passes (from what I hear). This is certainly something that we need to speed up our builds, but we'll have to put pressure on upstream LLVM (or implement it ourselves) because I don't see any way we could do this manually (without splitting into many `LLVMContext`-s)\n",
