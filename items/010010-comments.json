    "body": "@brson I've noticed in `std::char`, the constant is named simply `MAX`, with no `_VALUE` suffix. Should I match this convention?\n\nNow that I think about it, I prefer the shorter `MIN` and `MAX` actually. They'll end up referred as e.g. `int::MAX`, which looks a lot like `INT_MAX` in C. I think the main reason we kept the suffixes was to prevent confusion with the `min` and `max` functions; capitalizing the constants makes this a non-issue.\n",
