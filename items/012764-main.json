  "body": "# Summary\n\nThis patch introduces the `_` token into the type grammar, with the meaning \"infer this type\".\nWith this change, the following two lines become equivalent:\n\n```\nlet x = foo();\nlet x: _ = foo();\n```\n\nBut due to its composability, it enables partial type hints like this:\n\n```\nlet x: Bar<_> = baz();\n```\n\nUsing it on the item level is explicitly forbidden, as the Rust language does not enable global type inference by design.\n\nThis implements the feature requested in https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9508.\n# Things requiring clarification\n- The change to enable it is very small, but I have only limited understanding of the related code, so the approach here might be wrong.\n  - In particular, while this patch works, it does so in a way not originally intended according to the code comments.\n- This probably needs more tests, or rather feedback for which tests are still missing.\n- I'm unsure how this interacts with lifetime parameters, and whether it is correct in regard to them.\n- Partial type hints on the right side of `as` like `&foo as *_` work in both a normal function contexts and in constexprs like `static foo: *int = &'static 123 as *_`. The question is whether this should be allowed in general.\n# Todo for this PR\n- The manual and tutorial still needs updating.\n# Bugs I'm unsure how to fix\n- Requesting inference for the top level of the right hand side of a `as` fails to infer correctly, even if all possible hints are given:\n  \n  ```\n  .../type_hole_1.rs:35:18: 35:22 error: the type of this value must be known in this context\n  .../type_hole_1.rs:35     let a: int = 1u32 as _;\n                                         ^~~~\n  ```\n",
