    "body": "> why do you believe that philosopher 0 will always run first?\n\nIt never occurred to me that ...\n\n> Threads do not necessarily execute in exactly the order they're spawned\n\nIn part, because I ran the code probably a hundred times and got the same output (which doesn't match the current docs).\n\nThanks for the tip, @sfackler! I added a little more output to my code and can see what you're saying now:\n\n``` diff\n        thread::spawn(move || {\n+           println!(\"{} starting\", p.name);\n            p.eat(&table);\n        })\n```\n\nStill... I have **never** seen two philosophers eating together (not since college, at least).\n\nI think the docs for this exercise -- which is about _learning Rust_ -- shouldn't present an edge case (if that's accurate) as the norm and assume that a beginner (me) would connect the dots -- i.e., that since spawned thread execution order is arbitrary, it's remotely possible that two philosophers could eat at the same time if the order of execution is just so. It sure confused the heck out of me. I was certain that I had missed something in my code.\n\nI've reverted my initial change and instead suggest a clarification just to the wording: 7dc7531.\n",
