    "body": "This is a dup of #2549.  Basically the problem here is that you cannot _move_ out of upvars right now, because Rust  function types always assume they may be called more than once.  To work around this, you must either use a channel to send the value to the task (rather than capturing it via an upvar) or use the so-called \"option dance\".  Hopefully this will be fixed in 0.5.\n",
