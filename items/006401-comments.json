    "body": "Thinking about this more, I think the first option is preferable if we keep the `fn main() { ... }` in pkg.rs.\n\nIn order to support both pre-build logic and post-build logic otherwise you'd need to either disallow post-build logic without supressing default behavior, or you could have three functions with default implementations: `prebuild`, `build`, and `postbuild`, where normally people are only overiding the first one.\n\nSince keeping `main` is the easiest path forward and doesn't close any other paths in the future, option one seems to be the way to go.\n",
