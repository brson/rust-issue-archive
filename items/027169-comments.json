    "body": "Nice work @huonw!\n\n> I think the platform specific intrinsics should go in their own extern ABI (i.e. not \"rust-intrinsic\")\n\nI agree, not having the namespace of \"simd_\" made me a tad uneasy.\n\n> I think it would be very nice for this to land without requiring the RFC to land first, because of the first point, and because this is the only way for any further work to happen/be experimented with, without requiring people to build/install/multirust a compiler from a custom branch.\n\nI would personally be ok with this, but I'm curious to hear what others think as well? Also, do you think the RFC basically has \"broad consensus\" modulo minor details by this point? If there are still some somewhat contentious decisions here and there it may be worth waiting a little longer before landing this, but if we're all in agreement pretty much then any future minor updates can be easily reflected here (as everything is unstable anyway).\n\ncc @rust-lang/lang \n",

Not sure exactly where we should go with this, but the current arrangement is the conservative default (opt-in except for the cases where it is truly guaranteed: SSE2 on x86-64, and NEON on AArch64).\n\nSo I ask myself, how does clang does it? It has to `#define __SSE2__` (and others). The answer is that [it's based on the CPU type](http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/lib/Basic/Targets.cpp?view=markup). The i686 targets in `rustc_back::target` all set `options.cpu` within the `Target` to `\"pentium4\"` or newer, and according to the clang code that has at least SSE2.\n\nBut rust doesn't use clang; the _real_ code for that is at `src/llvm/lib/Target/X86/X86.td`, where the processor `pentium4` sets a `FeatureSSE2` flag (which when set sets a `FeatureSSE1` flag, and so on).\n\nThe ideal way would be to ask LLVM since it's the authoritative source, but I wonder why clang doesn't do it; either clang needs more information than LLVM has, or it's not easily possible to ask LLVM for the correct list of features given the CPU model. Another option would be to duplicate what clang does, and have a hand-written map from the processor name to its SIMD features. It would have to be manually updated every time LLVM is updated, which isn't too much work but would be easy to forget.\n",
