  "body": "This \"bubble up an error\" macro was originally named if_ok! in order to get it\nlanded, but after the fact it was discovered that this name is not exactly\ndesirable.\n\nThe name `if_ok!` isn't immediately clear that is has much to do with error\nhandling, and it doesn't look fantastic in all contexts (if if_ok!(...) {}). In\ngeneral, the agreed opinion about `if_ok!` is that is came in as subpar.\n\nThe name `try!` is more invocative of error handling, it's shorter by 2 letters,\nand it looks fitting in almost all circumstances. One concern about the word\n`try!` is that it's too invocative of exceptions, but the belief is that this\nwill be overcome with documentation and examples.\n\nClose #12037\n",
