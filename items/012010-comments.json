    "body": "I think that this is a great crate to have. The \"collections library\" is quite a meaty crate that I imagine will be quite useful to downstream users.\n\nI do have some concerns about this though:\n- Should this be libcollection or libcollections? It looks like there's `java.util.collections` and python has a `collections` library, so perhaps precedent says to go with the pluralization?\n- I'm a little worried about having some collections in libstd and some in libcollection. I think this is done out of necessity right now, but I would think that it should be a goal to move `HashMap` to libcollection.\n- I'm also a little worried about our \"stuttering problem\". We've solved this in other crates via private modules and reexports at the top level, but that doesn't work quite so well for collections I think. Due to collections frequently having external iterators as their own types, you can't really reexport just TreeMap. That being said, I'd be fine with referring to `collections::treemap::Entries`, but also referring to `collections::TreeMap`. I think that the best solution for this for now is to have the reexport, but also have the inner module be public. Our usage and examples of libcollections would have to have `use collections::TreeMap` instead of the `treemap::TreeMap` variant.\n",
