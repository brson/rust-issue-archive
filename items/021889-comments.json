But if it is deleted, it seems the link could point to a new file.\n- OpenBSD: it is the one I wrote, and as OpenBSD don't provide method for obtain the filepath of a running program, it use `argv[0]` as source of information.\n  In a security perspective it is bad as `argv[0]` could be forged by the parent processus.\n- MacOS or Windows : not tested.\n",

    "body": "> cause self_exe_name to point to some new file (I imagine this isn't possible on most platforms?)\n\nThis is easy to do on Unix, since files can be deleted or moved while they are running.\n\nIn thinking about how both rustc and rustup use current_exe, it seems like it would be easy to influence what code they run by changing file at that path, particularly with rustup, which will actually execute it during uninstallation.\n\nAt the same time, when I think of bugs that could lead attackers to cause a compiler like rustc to execute arbitrary code, I start to think of all the other ways people could influence rustc to execute arbitrary code, and it seems hopeless. If an attacker has local disk access there are unlimited things they could do to cause a compiler to execute anything.\n",
