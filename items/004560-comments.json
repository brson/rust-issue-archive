For no particular reason, the typechecker is picking the `&str` impl first, because `~str` can be autosliced to `&str`. That causes the warning, since the autoslicing requires an implicit copy.\n\nI haven't proved this to myself yet, but the error does go away if I replace your generic implementation with specific ones for `int` and `~str`.\n",
