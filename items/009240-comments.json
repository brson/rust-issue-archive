    "body": "@catamorphism: I had this same problem in fbuild. I worked around if by comparing [hashes](https://github.com/felix-lang/fbuild/blob/master/lib/fbuild/db/backend.py#L252) if the timestamps were the same. For the tests, I believe I just did something cheesy where I just would do the equivalent of a `sleep 1` in between \n\nAnother thing you might run into is that I had to put locks in a couple places to make sure that multiple threads didn't stomp on each other. First was a lock around hashing a file to prevent [work duplication](https://github.com/felix-lang/fbuild/blob/master/lib/fbuild/db/database.py#L226). Second, I ended up running the database in it's own thread and serialized reads and writes with a queue to protect against multiple threads trying to run the same function at the same time. You can see that code [here](https://github.com/felix-lang/fbuild/blob/master/lib/fbuild/db/database.py) by looking for any uses of `_rpc`. I'm not sure if `workcache.rs` is protecting against that. I'm traveling tomorrow, but I should be around this weekend or next week if any of that was unclear or have any questions.\n",
