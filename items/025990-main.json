  "body": "The API documentation is not explicit enough that because `try!` returns\n`Err` early for you, you can only use it in functions that return\n`Result`. The book mentions this, but if you come across `try!` outside\nof the book and look it up in the docs, this restriction on the return\ntype of the function is not particularly clear.\n\nI seriously had this epiphany a few days ago after working with Rust for MONTHS, and after seeing [a friend have to come to the same realization](http://joelmccracken.github.io/entries/a-simple-web-app-in-rust-pt-2a/), I'd like to save more people from this confusion :) :sparkling_heart: \n",
