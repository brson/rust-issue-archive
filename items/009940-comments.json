    "body": "Seems to me `int` and `uint` are not pointers, so a 'ptr' suffix doesn't make a whole lot of sense. What would the type be of the `~[T].len()` and `[T, ..n].len()`? Surely not `uintptr`. Perhaps introduce `size_t`?\n\nI rather like the `int` and `uint` types. Why can't they coexist with `Int`? If they're going to get renamed to something ugly perhaps it would be best to stick with `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t`, existing Rust users are going to have to get used to the new stuff anyway, and it'll be easier to remember for those coming from C/C++.\n\nI think the machine-word-sized `int` and `uint` are really nice to use as they are at this time. `Int` could be `BigInt` or `Integer` for people who really want arbitrary sized integers, but I'm thinking the vast majority of the time you don't want/need that functionality anyway.\n",

    "body": "IMHO, the interesting questions are: what type should be used to index into arrays, and what should it be named? Indexing into arrays is pretty common. A pointer-sized type is needed to be able to represent any index. It should presumably be unsigned. I'm not sure if there's much reason to also have a signed version. Expanding to a BigInt on overflow doesn't make much sense here. But wrapping around on over/underflow _also_ doesn't make very much sense, I think. If you want to catch over/underflow and `fail!()` or similar, you lose a lot (or all) of the performance advantage you might have had over the expand-to-BigInt version. So there's decent arguments in favor of expanding, wrapping, as well as trapping.\n\nI think the strongest argument might be for expanding: negative or larger-than-the-address-space values don't make sense for array indexes, but the array bounds check will already catch that. Meanwhile it's versatile and generally useful for most other situations as well, not just array indexing. The downside is a performance cost relative to a type that wraps on over/underflow. (In the event of a fixed pointer-sized type, the relevant association when naming it should be that it holds any array index, not that it's pointer-sized.)\n\nWhatever this type ends up being and named, it's the one that should be in the `prelude`.\n\nIf someone explicitly needs pointer-sized machine integers for `unsafe` hackery, those could indeed be named `intptr` and `uintptr` and buried in a submodule somewhere.\n",

    "body": "I find this thread confusing.\n- Having fixed size types does not make overflow irrelevant. It's well-defined, but it's equally well-defined on `uint` if you know your target architecture. The danger occurs because people write innocent-looking code that can easily overflow if supplied with large inputs. Consider `(a + b) / 2`, which is incorrect if `a` or `b` is large, _even though_ the end result _ought to be_ between `a` and `b`. (A safer way to write that expression is something like `a + (b - a) / 2`.)\n- I disagree that `uint` is \"almost always\" a bad choice or something like that. Most of the times that I write an integer, it is an index into an array or in some way tied to the size of a data structure. In those times, having it be the same size as a pointer is a very logical choice. I know there are [good arguments for LP64](http://www.unix.org/version2/whatsnew/lp64_wp.html), and in practice I've probably never worked with an array of more than 4bil elements, but somehow hard-coding 32-bit doesn't seem particularly forward looking. In any case, the RFC wasn't that we adopt LP64 rather than ILP64 (which was considered for a time and eventually rejected).\n- I am not quite sure what the proposal was regarding adding `Int` to the standard library, but I don't see how it's an improvement on the current situation, other than a slight simplification to the compiler:\n  - If `Int` is an alias for `i32` or `i64` as appropriate, it creates a portability nightmare. We tried it for a while. Code written by someone using a 64-bit compiler almost never compiled on 32-bit machines and vice versa. With bors this would be a bit better but most people don't have bors.\n  - If `Int` is a newtype, that's better, but it'll still be quite annoying to use.\n- The asymmetry between floats and ints doesn't bother me. The argument for removing `float` was that people don't write \"generic\" floating point code, but rather they target a specific precision for specific performance needs. Since I don't write a lot of code that uses floating point, I don't know personally, but I buy it as plausible. I don't think this argument holds for integers, which are most commonly used as loop counters, array indices, etc. where hard-coding to a specific size doesn't feel especially portable to me. I'd rather add back `float` than remove `int` and `uint`.\n",

    "body": "Even for array indices `uint` isn't so obviously the winner. It has the right size, yes - but wraparound on under/overflow still doesn't make any sense. If it's flowing in either direction, you have a bug. The 'right thing' would be something uint-sized with dynamic checks against under/overflow. (But maybe if you have the dynamic checks, then you might as well use them to expand to a bigint instead of failing? That's not any worse for catching bugs, because they'll just be caught by the array bounds check (or the prior conversion to uint), instead.) But either of these also has a strong likelihood of being unacceptably slow -- but that also heavily depends on the use case. That seems like the fundamental dilemma to me.\n",

If we used the syntax `int(<lower bound>, <upper bound>)` for this you could do something like this:\n\n```\n// This integer range is implemented as at least an i8/u8, but could be implemented\n// as an i32 for efficiency.\nfn get(i: int(0, 100)) -> u32 {...}\n\n// This integer range is implemented as the most appropriate signed type\n// for the expressions it is used in in the function body (at least an i8).\nfn set_slot(i: int(-10, 10)) {...}\n\nfn main() {\n    for x in range(0u64, 1000) {\n        // The compiler allows passing this u64 argument without a cast,\n        // but checks to see if x is in the range (0, 100) before\n        // executing the function, and fails if it isn't.\n        let s = get(x);\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Vector {\n    size: u64\n}\n\nimpl Vector {\n    // ~~Automatic bounds checking~~\n    // Because 'size' is unknown at compile-time, argument 'i' will\n    // be implemented as a u64 to ensure it works for any value of 'size'\n    // However, i is still bounds-checked!\n    fn get(&self, i: int(0, self.size) ) {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n// Here we want i to be between 0 and num_records, but never greater than 1000.\n// The compiler can then determine that i should be an i16 (or larger if it means\n// better performance).\nfn get_record(i: int(0, num_records, 1000)) {...}\n\n// An overflow-safe square function.\n// Wrapping an integer type in int() tells the compiler to check for overflow:\n// int(u32) is equivalent to int(0, 0xFFFFFFFF).\n// The input parameter should be checked for overflow at the call site when it is\n// passed types such as i32, u64 etc (for which overflow is possible).\nfn square_root(x: int(u32) ) -> int(u16) {...}\n\n// This function accepts an unbounded range, so use a BigInt:\nfn increment(x: int(0, *) ) {...}\n```\n\nThis concept almost completely abstracts away hardware-based integer sizes, but still allowing them to be used as the underlying implementation for performance.\n\nIf the programmer wants fixed-size/wrapping types/zero overhead then they can continue to use `i32`, `i64` etc.. and if they want a type of unconstrained size they can use a `BigInt`.\n\nI haven't thought through all the implications of this idea, but I figured I'd just throw it out there.\n\nI also know this is slightly off-track from the actual issue I'm posting under, but integers in Rust seems to be a hot topic at the moment.\n",

    "body": "@ecl3ctic: The CPU will typically provide instructions for two's complement arithmetic, so the same instructions are used for signed/unsigned integers (excluding division). You check for signed overflow with a carry flag and unsigned overflow with the actual two's complement overflow flag.\n\nBranching based on the flag can drastically reduce the amount of instruction-level parallelization performed by the CPU, and likely prevents compiler-level auto-vectorization in most cases too. A custom overflow limit on one end will add a comparison operation but not an extra branch while limits on both ends could be significantly slower than just standard overflow checking.\n\nIf overflow checks are the default, Rust code not explicitly written to avoid them will typically be slower than Java. In tight loops, there's not much more important than integer and floating point performance. Giving the compiler as much information as possible about aliasing/immutability is all about letting it play more with these inner loops but it will all be for nothing if they're full of unnecessary overflow checking branches.\n",

That said, while I find the current design quite logical, an\nunbounded sized integer type _would_ be a nice thing to have. The\nbottom line though is that I think this bug cannot progress without\nmore data. All of us (including myself) are making rather unsupported\nclaims. I'd like to see any or all of the following:\n1. A survey of uses of the int/uint types, showing how many of them\n   are appropriate / inappropriate / borderline.\n2. An actual implementation of an efficient bigint that we can use to\n   make default performance comparisons; to my knowledge, the only\n   bigint types that have been developed are basically wrappers around\n   GNU's bigint, which I don't think is suitably licensed nor\n   particularly performant. Correct me if I am wrong.\n   \n   Regardless, If it's going to be the default integer type, it's\n   going to get used a lot, and I'd like to know how fast it's going\n   to be. The prior work that I'm aware of is all in the area of\n   dynamic languages (JavaScript, Python, Smalltalk, etc) and all of\n   them expend a significant amount of energy optimizing away the\n   bigint overhead and customizing for the expected smallint case\n   (s/digint/double, in the case of JS). As a purely compiled\n   language, we don't have that luxury.\n3. Measurements concerning the overhead of using the current scheme\n   augmented with bounds checking for all types. It seems to me that\n   bounds checking offers a reasonable compromise, in that people\n   may still use `int` inappropriately, but at least their integers\n   won't silently wrap around but instead fail in a noisy way.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger Thanks for the link. I am aware that the names come from the C/C++ standards, but still find them confusing (to rust newcomers from outside the C/C++ world).\n\nNow come to think of it, this is a convention that can be learnt quickly, and C# actually uses `IntPtr` in a similar manner, so in this regard, it is quite okay.\n\nBut there may be another problem:  the names `intptr/uintptr` (or `intps/uintps` for that matter) don't seem to reflect their main use case in safe-mode rust.  They should be more akin to `ssize_t/size_t` than `intptr_t/uintptr_t`, and there are good reasons why C/C++ differentiates the two pairs. So I think we should differntiate them too. \n\nThis is to say, we may have dedicated names for container-indexing integer types, while the fact that they are pointer sized is an implementation detail on certain architectures,  just like in C/C++. \n\nHere are three pairs of possible candidates: `intsize/uintsize`, `isize/usize` and `size/ssize`. They all have:\n\nCommon pros:\n1. clearer intention than `intptr/uintptr`. \n   (For a C/C++ programmer that is. He/she will accept quickly that a \"size\" type has something to do with \"indexes\".)\n2. won't break where `size_t` and `uintptr_t` are different. \n   (Does rust target such architectures? If not, is it possible that they will be targeted later?)\n\nCommon cons:\n1. not suited for other possible use cases of pointer sized integers.\n   (Eh, what are those in safe-mode rust? And in unsafe mode, can we get away with std::libc types?)\n\nPros and cons specific to each candidate:\n\n`intsize/uintsize`, like `intptr/uintptr`, are long and out of place, so as to discourage their usage. But I think such \"ugliness\" is unnecessary, because:\n\n`isize/usize` are more in alignment with the rust naming convention, and shorter.  They are still somewhat ugly and foreign at first glance, while being specific enough so people won't toss them everywhere.\n\nOn the other hand, `ssize/size` align with C/C++ `ssize_t/size_t`. Some may consider this an advantage, but for the most part, safe-mode rust doesn't directly use C/C++ type names anyway.  And `size` does occupy the common word \"size\".\n\nSo I lean towards `isize/usize`.\n\nRegarding an arbitrarily sized `Int`, in a systems language, people may expect `Int` to be fix-sized, so I believe `BigInt` is a better name, signifying the higher cost of such a type.\n\nI am not sure about my stance on the \"default integer type\" issue, but people must make informed choices consciously. Some \"rusty guidelines to integer type selection\" in the docs would be great.\n",

What should the \"default\" integer type be, both for integer literal inference, and for accepting and receiving from stdlib APIs (in order to avoid having to sprinkle casts everywhere)?\n3. Should we prefer to encourage signed ints, or unsigned ints?\n4. To what degree should bigints be a first-class type?\n5. On what types do we want to accept the cost of bounds checking?\n\nI personally think that `int` being the default is a mistake, and I've seen a lot of people recoil when they realize that our \"default\" integer type has both a maximum size after which it wraps _and_ that size varies by architecture. This is the worst of both worlds.\n\nThe _easiest_ way to make immediate progress (not the _best_, mind you) might be the following:\n1. `int` -> `intptr` and `uint` -> `uintptr` (let's bikeshed later, we can trivially rename before 1.0, all we need for now is a name that doesn't encourage use).\n2. Convert integer literal inference to make `i32` the default integer type (yeah it's super gross, but I really doubt that vast majority of code is going to want to pay for a bigint, and at least this is _honest_ about its limitations).\n\nThis lets us punt on the topics of bigints, bounds checking, and signed vs unsigned for a later date.\n",
