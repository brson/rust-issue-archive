    "body": "Thanks. As exploration I've tested exactly this method, and it increased throughput of binary data to LineWriter buffered stdout hugely on my machine, (from 0.9 GB/s to 1.6 GB/s in my test), and with it, my regular rust reimplementation of `cat` behaved the same as the original, even when I was using he LineWriter buffered stdout.\n\nSo the solution is certainly good on a platform with a fast memchr (glibc/linux in my case).\n\nLibc on windows does not provide such a nice version. So I think ideally should have mem**r**chr (which does not exist on windows at all), but we can provide a reasonably fast fallback.\n\nI wanted to ask you @alexcrichton, can we add such a custom mem**r**chr to libstd for now? The code for a mem**r**chr fallback already exists, in [memchr](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-memchr) written by yours truly.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton And a trickier question, in libcore we'd like to have both memchr and memrchr available for byte, char and substring searching, and it would dramatically speed them up. Is it possible to have an optional libc dependency? Having just the rust versions of those functions would still be a massive performance win, but the glibc version is yet much faster.\n\nThis is just more context for placement ^\n\nMaybe we can have the rust versions in libcore, and have libstd use either-or depending on what's available.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the PR @fhahn! This looks good to me, although the semantics have changed due to searching from the front of the string instead of the end (which may not flush as much as it needs to).\n\n@bluss I'd prefer to not pick up a libc dep in core, but having different versions in core/std seems fine. This has been an open libs question for quite awhile now and I'd rather not export this as a public API as a result, but having it as an implementation detail is fine.\n\nAlong those lines I don't mind bringing in `memrchr` stuff to get it to work. Ideally we'd just copy whatever glibc does as I suspect that LLVM is at least capable of generating such code.\n",

This would mean that the crate would become obsolete. It seems quite popular (163,233 downloads on crates.io right now) and I want to make sure not to step on anybodys toes.\n\nRegarding a SIMD implementation in Rust, the `simd` crate shipped with rustc is deprecated and the external crate should be used. So a hand written SIMD version could not make it into core, right?\n",

Don't worry about obsoleting `rust-memchr` if that should happen; it's also far into the future (needs to be stabilized in libstd before that, and it's not even been proposed here).\n\nSince @alexcrichton prefers this only as a private implementation detail, we can add it to just libstd for now? I just wanted to raise the flag that it will be needed in libcore as soon as we get around to it. Ascii byte searches and single byte substring searches could be massively improved.\n",
