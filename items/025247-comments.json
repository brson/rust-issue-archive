In particular, adding such a method would also require us to make the `Typer` in `trans` mutable, which is what my other patch is doing (I think, anyway--but maybe making it store a `Typer` instead of a `&mut Typer` allows us to avoid this?).\n\nI agree that the duplication is unfortunate; a lot of it could probably be resolved with a macro like the `unpack_datum!` one in trans, but I didn't think of it at the time.\n",

So maybe I actually should have taken the double-parameter approach in trans, and the single-parameter approach here, rather than the other way around.\n",
