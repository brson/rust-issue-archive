    "body": "@alexcrichton ~~we _could_ backport _just_ the addition of `PhantomData` to `Rc` and `Arc`, as a separate patch.~~\n\nI'm on the fence about it, just because I don't like injecting too much divergence between the code bases. But they _are_ unsound today without that, as one can see by running @apasel422 's test case from this ticket against stable. Or if you prefer seeing one that drives the point home a bit more obviously: http://is.gd/lvcTmN\n\nUpdate: OH, yeah, the `CoerceUnsized` stuff, I forgot about that.  Okay, yeah, then forget back-porting then.\n",
