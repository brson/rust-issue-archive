  "body": "This is a rather nice cleanup, but, as described in the commit message, introduces a bit of unsafe code. I may be so blinded by my unwillingness to abandon my pleasant patch that my judgement is clouded. I'd like to have one or two team member sign off on this before I merge it. No need to read the whole patch -- the commit message and `mk_t` in `ty.rs` should give you a good idea of what it does.\n\n(The slowdown seen by the non-unsafe version of this patch has turned into a small speedup in the unsafe version.)\n",
