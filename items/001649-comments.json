    "body": "One issue occurred to me.  This is not so much related to the parsing as it is related to my efforts to make bind() and closures follow the same path through the code (right now, bind is different, and hence many things that should work actually don't, e.g., `bind v.foo(_)`).  \n\nThe change is that if I write `foo(a, _)` (here I will use `bind`-less syntax to indicate the new path through the code), then what I am generating is basically sugar for `{|b| foo(a, b)}`.  But this is not the same as what `bind foo(a, _)` generated, which was kind of sugar for `{let a0 = a; {|b| foo(a0, b)}}`.  \n\nIt's not clear to me that it's a problem, but it's a change. It has some advantages. It allows the syntax to work with movable values, for example, in particular stack closures.  That means something like:\n\n```\nlist.map({|x| x+2}, _) \n```\n\nworks just fine even if `{|x| x+2}` becomes a stack closure.\n\nThe disadvantage of course is that complex expressions get re-evaluated each time the closure is invoked.\n",
