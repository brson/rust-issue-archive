    "body": "Work is still ongoing.  I got distracted by regions, but the two parts are starting to come together, so I'm dusting off my old branch. I may try to land this in the next couple of days (presuming that there are no objections from @brson @catamorphism or @pcwalton), assuming that I can get everything building.  One rule that will be enforced is that a local variable passed by a const reference mode (`&&`) is made immutable for the duration of the call---this rule will be obsolete of course with regions, though a similar rule might apply to borrowing mutable uniques (that is, a `~mut T` could be borrowed as a `&T`---here the mutability was lost, but we can statically guarantee that the `~mut` will not be mutated for the time in which the `&T` is live, so it's ok)\n",
