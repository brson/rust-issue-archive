[MSDN shows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb263953%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) that color-recognition deficiencies still let the people see blue.\nSo which kind of deficiencies are we talking about? I had an economics teacher that had major vision problems and he would require us to write in black and had a special kind of magnifying glass with white lighting. I assume people with major vision deficiencies use a screen reader, otherwise a CSS injection plugin will override styles conveniently (e.g., [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) for Firefox).\n\nI don't see any concrete evidence of cases where someone would a/ not see the blue color and b/ not have any software alternative available that would not require a mandatory edit to the mainline stylesheet &ndash; otherwise they would not be able to browse most modern websites (GitHub here included) (?). Bootstrap does not underline links and [has a committance](getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#accessibility) towards accessibility, the [accessibility plugin](https://github.com/paypal/bootstrap-accessibility-plugin) itself does not add mandatory underline either...\n\nUnderlining is being phased out is modern websites because it halts the document flow, much more than a color change does.  \nIf there was a case of both a/ and b/ above being fulfilled then sure I would be backing always-on underlining, but there does not seem to be one afaict.\n",

    "body": "@adrientetar Right, using the color and nothing else itself is not a problem. It is a problem that using the color _which doesn't have enough contrast from the surrounding text_. (And there are certainly [people who cannot distinguish hues at all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromacy).) My initial comment is based on the fact that @ipetkov's screenshot doesn't seem to have enough contrast when grayscaled.\n\nSome concrete numbers: WCAG 2.0 Level AA requires at least 3:1 contrast for most visual cues (it's actually 4.5:1 except for large texts, but for the purpose of this discussion let's think it as an absolute minimum). The PR uses `#333333` for text and `#4d76ae` for link, yielding the contrast ratio of 2.72:1 (you can verify it with a [checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)). For comparison Bootstrap seems to use `#333333` for text and `#4e8bca` for link, yielding the ratio of 3.53:1. Of course this greatly depends on the actual color space and gamma, and color-blind users would certainly use a high-contrast configuration.\n\nWell, this seems to suggest that one can meet the basic accessibility by simply making the link color slightly lighter. What do you think about this?\n\nNote: We should also eventually think about other visual cues for the accessibility.\n",
