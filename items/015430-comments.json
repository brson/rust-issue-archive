    "body": "Actually I don't think this is true. Consider the following program, which compiles:\n\n```\nstruct Foo {\n    a: Bar,\n    b: int,\n}\n\nstruct Bar {\n    c: int,\n    d: int,\n}\n\nimpl Deref<Bar> for Foo {\n    fn deref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a Bar {\n        &self.a\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Foo {\n    fn baz(~self) {\n        println!(\"hello\");\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Bar {\n    fn baz(&self) {\n        println!(\"goodbye\");\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut f = Foo {\n        a: Bar {\n            c: 1,\n            d: 2,\n        },\n        b: 3,\n    };\n    f.baz();\n}\n```\n\nNotice how the call to `.baz()` just ignores the irrelevant `~self` method. This is analogous to what will happen with static methods in the future. So I believe UFCS to be backwards compatible. Closing.\n",
