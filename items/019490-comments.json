    "body": "I have tried several schemes:\n1. check if the format is string (starts and ends with a quote) or if it is integer (no quotes, but can be converted to integer), else panic. This is rather hacky and requires unsafe and transmute (as it currently already does)\n2. make emit_map_elt_key generic over a type parameter that requires map keys to implement a trait `EncodableAsMapKey<S : Encoder<E>, E>` and `Encodable`. This way there's no function parameter, and Encoders can specify which Types can be map keys by implementing that trait for them. Does not help about the unsafe and transmute, as quotes still need to be added sometimes. Checks at compile-time.\n3. check type through TypeId (+ pass type instead of function to `emit_map_elt_key`). Forces a limited set of hardcoded types allowed as keys (types, not traits, implementing your own string type won't work).\n\nA few more possible ways to do these checks\n1. create `emit_map_elt_key_*` for all the types that exist as `emit_*`\n2. wait for generic specialization and overwrite the Encodable impls for collections to check stuff for json encoder\n3. create `emit_map_elt_key_num`, `emit_map_elt_key_string` and `emit_map_elt_key_object`\n4. add trait parameters to Encoder for choosing a trait that all map keys must implement (checks at compile time)\n5. add trait parameters to Encoder for choosing a trait that all Encodables must implement.
