  "body": "The methods `at` and `name` on `Captures<'t>` return `\"\"` to represent both failed matches and successful matches against the empty string. In the case of `at`, a programmer can use `pos` to distinguish between the two situations. But in the case of `name`, there's no good, public API which allows us to test for a match.\n\nThe follow regex has two named matched groups, `key` and `value`. `value` is optional:\n\n``` rust\n// Matches \"foo\", \"foo;v=bar\" and \"foo;v=\".\nregex!(r\"(?P<key>[a-z]+)(;v=(?P<value>[a-z]*))?\");\n```\n\nWe can access `value` using `caps.name(\"value\")`, but there's no way for us to distinguish between the `\"foo\"` and `\"foo;v=\"` cases.\n\nEven if we're willing to treat both meanings of `\"\"` as \"failed match\", it's still a nuisance to convert them to `Option`:\n\n``` rust\nfn name<'t>(caps: &Captures<'t>, name: &str) -> Option<&'t str> {\n    let s = caps.name(name);\n    if s == \"\" { None } else { Some(s) }\n}\n```\n\nNow, I don't know whether it would be better to modify `at` and `name` to return `Option`, or add new `at_opt` and `name_opt` functions. But at the very least, there should be some convenient way to distinguish between the cases `\"foo\"` and `\"foo;v=\"`.\n\nThis would be relatively easy to implement, because `Captures` uses `Option` internally.\n",
