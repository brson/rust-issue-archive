    "body": "I don't believe we need three different variations of to_lowercase in std.\r\n\r\nThere are four tiers that have been raised in this issue:\r\n\r\n- Dead simple, such as you might use for converting an md5 hash from uppercase hex to lowercase hex. This is provided by the standard library in [`str::to_ascii_lowercase`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.str.html#method.to_ascii_lowercase).\r\n- Best-effort Unicode aware. This is provided by the standard library in [`str::to_lowercase`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.str.html#method.to_lowercase) and is probably what people who don't know what they want, want. Hence the straightforward name.\r\n- Somewhere in between the previous two, non-ascii codepointwise lowercase. I see how this could be useful but it is going to be a hard sell adding a third variant of to_lowercase. This feels like a niche use case to me and would be served sufficiently well by a crate.\r\n- Locale aware case mapping. I agree with Simon that this involves sophistication beyond what we would be comfortable placing in std. This would be better suited for a crate.\r\n\r\nI am closing this issue because I would like to see this explored in a crate instead. Once there is an implementation and more clarity around what algorithm we mean by codepointwise lowercase, if people still believe this needs to be in std, I would be open to reconsidering.",
