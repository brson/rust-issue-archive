    "body": "Ok, this looks pretty good to me, and here's my thoughts on an option like this:\n- I think an option along these lines is inevitable and we're gonna need to add it to the compiler at some point. The linked Cargo issue is a legitimate use case and I have a feeling this restriction will start to pop up more often.\n- There is prior art here in a number of GNU tools that take an argument of the form `@file` where `file` is read for options. The main difference seem to be that GNU uses whitespace as a separator, including quotes/backslashes in the syntax to parse the options with spaces.\n- I like having a dedicated flag for this instead of special `@` syntax like GNU. I don't think that anyone's going to be actually using this sort of option manually, I expect the only real use case to be tooling like Cargo or other `rustc` drivers possibly. Along those lines I don't think we need a sugary way of specifying this option.\n- I'm ok with a byte terminator between arguments. They're very hard to generate by hand but along the lines of the previous bullet I don't think that's the use case this sort of option is catering to, I expect it to largely just be tooling.\n- I'm ok with the nul byte as a terminator, it's easy to remember and rarely shows up in arguments (e.g. it's _very_ unlikely to have a nul byte in a path).\n- Don't worry too much about dealing with `--`, this library is only really used by our own internal tools and I believe none of them need that kind of functionality.\n- Treating `-` as stdin can probably be elided for now, I don't think the compiler handles this for output and along the lines of the points above I don't think many tools will be piping options to the compiler via this mechanism (but will instead just write out files).\n- This is a new option to the compiler, and despite being behind `-Z unstable-options` (which isn't really gated at all) it's semi-insta-stable, so I'd want to tread carefully.\n\ncc @rust-lang/tools, this is a new argument to the compiler which will probably make its way into at least `rustdoc` at some point if not other places.\n",

    "body": "> Treating - as stdin can probably be elided for now, I don't think the compiler handles this for output and along the lines of the points above I don't think many tools will be piping options to the compiler via this mechanism (but will instead just write out files).\n\nI don\u2019t see how otherwise cargo would reliably pass in arguments to rustc. Creating a temporary file for rustc to read these off it would be racy when there\u2019s more than one concurrent invocation of rustc\u2026\n\nWell, you could create a temporary file for each rustc invocation, but do you really want to create that many temporaries?\n",

    "body": "Just a quick update / some of my thoughts:\n- I briefly considered the `@filename` syntax, but decided that it would be cleaner, more elegant and practical to use a real flag.\n- As mentioned in my previous comment I deliberately decided against some kind of whitespace separator because it would have made the parsing more difficult.\n- I removed the possibility to read from stdin using `-`, which simplified the code a little bit and removed the need to write tests for that functionality.\n- I'm currently writing some tests but it may take a few days before I find the time to finish them. \n\nWhich leads me to a question: What's the policy of using internal `rustc_private` crates for tests? I noticed that the existing `getopts` tests already use the `log` crate (which seems kinda stable) and am currently using `rustc_back::tempdir::TempDir` (which does not seem to be very widely used) in the tests to get a location where I can write the temporary files to.\n",

It's true that I doubt anything actually has a newline in the argument, and we could always add some form of escaping perhaps.\n",

    "body": "I think there's certainly an appeal to not having to go through a postprocessing step to get a readable file (e.g. in favor of newlines), but I also don't personally feel particularly strong one way or another. I think we may want to consider escaping here in terms of design, and that'd influence whether it needs to be implemented. For example I don't think that as-is we could add escaping backwards compatibly to a format that's \"just newline separated\" as whatever the escape character is would need to also be escaped.\n\nAs for the in-tree vs crates.io crate, they're not normally intentionally kept in sync (the external one tends to evolve though). I only bring this up in the sense that one day we'd like to use external crates in our build here instead of having vendored versions. I think it's fine to basically decide what to do here and then perhaps move it to the external crate as well.\n",

    "body": "So, let's consider the implications of choosing to use newlines and add escaping:\n- The usual escape character is `\\` which is what we would use I imagine\n- To keep the \"format\" simple we could define `\\` to mean that any special meaning of the following character will be ignored. `\\n` would thus be a literal `n`, `\\\\`a literal `\\` and `\\<LINEBREAK>` a literal line break and not an argument separator.\n- The sequence `\\<EOF>` would be considered an error.\n- The parsing would be a little bit more complicated (read the input `char` by `char`).\n- Cargo (or any other program using this feature) would have to escape any `\\` in the arguments (such as Windows paths).\n- With the editor use case, carefully consider what to do about an empty last argument (resulting from a file ending with a new line [which I, for example, configured my editors to do automatically): without a special case this would lead to an empty argument which could result in an error but also be intended.\n- Be careful with the language in any documentation: this would be `LF` separated, not any other line ending.\n\nSome more thoughts about actually using `LF` as the argument separator and the editor use case:\n- When I originally wrote this PR this feature was intended to be mainly / only be used by automated tools which require passing lots of arguments to `rustc`. \n- I imaging that any tool would clean up any temporary files soon after the `rustc` invocation, making it difficult to get hold of the file with the arguments.\n- I also imaging that any tool would provide the ability to log the `rustc` invocation in other ways.\n- At least the usual linux editors (vim, emacs, nano) are perfectly capable of rendering `NUL`, other editors vary (Sublime displays the file as hex, TextEdit and Atom don't display `NUL` but preserve it during edit / save, Notepad++ will render `NUL` if I remember correctly).\n\nConsidering all of that I think we should decide between the \"Machine Readable\" use case, using `NUL` as the separator or the \"Human Readable / Editable\" use case and use a [gcc like](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.0/gcc/Overall-Options.html) (search for `@`), whitespace separated syntax.\n\nI would define the whitespace separated syntax like this:\n- All whitespace characters are considered argument separators\n- `\\` escapes the following character as above.\n- Any consecutive whitespace is collapsed, whitespace at the beginning and end of file is ignored.\n- If the first character of an argument is a `\"` or `'`, all characters up to the next matching `\"` or `'` are considered part of the argument.\n\nUsing the whitespace separated syntax would of course make it more difficult for any tools to properly escape the arguments it want's to pass to `rustc`.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer going the machine readable route but would have not problem implementing the whitespace based approach.\n",

    "body": "Not sure how I feel about this yet.\n\nThat cargo wants such ginormous command lines is a smell. There may be alternative approaches that support cargo's use cases. For example, most of these command line arguments are taken up by mapping crates to libraries, and _this specifically_ could be driven by a file without imposing this generic command line parsing facility on not just rustc but all future rustc-compatible compilers. For another example, if cargo just used rustc as a library this would not be an issue.\n\nThe implementation here is complex compared to the value added - this is basically a hack to support cargo, but the semantics here of _mixing_ in arguments from another source seems to be imposing complexity when cargo doesn't need that - it can put all arguments in one file.\n\nThat this is directly modifying the getopts library also bothers me - this appears an unconventional command line parsing strategy; getopts is old and deprecated everywhere except rustc and somebody will want to move away  from it eventually; the weirder it is the harder that will be.\n",

    "body": "Closing due to inactivity for now, I sympathize with @brson's concerns and I also worry that if the rustc command line is too big it's almost guaranteed to mean the linker command line is _also_ too big (which isn't necessarily handled here). Along those lines, this sort of situation may need to be patched up in more than a few places.\n\nIt's also the case that the corresponding Cargo bug isn't necessarily reflective of idiomatic usage today, so while it'd be great to fix it's probably not critical. Regardless though, @TimNN if you'd like to move forward feel free to reach out to me/@brson in `#rust-tools` on IRC and we may be able to help push this forward!\n",
