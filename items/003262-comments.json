    "body": "Sorry I should have clarified what I meant by \"Constants for mutability\": In syntax/ast.rs:\n\n```\n181: enum mutability { m_mutbl, m_imm, m_const, }\n```\n\nThe reason why this is an issue is that there are functions in the reflection api, like for example:\n\n```\nfn visit_rec_field(_i: uint, _name: &str,  _mtbl: uint, inner: *tydesc) -> bool\n```\n\nwhere `_mtbl` is the `uint` value of that enum. This actually really confused me at first, because I figured it was a boolean cast as a uint, but 0 was mutable, and 1 was immutable (and 2 const, but I don't think that's relevant for record fields?)! Ideally the visitor api would actually have the function have this signature:\n\n```\nfn visit_rec_field(_i: uint, _name: &str,  _mtbl: mutability, inner: *tydesc) -> bool\n```\n\nAnd `mutability` would live somewhere that could be included by core::reflect (once that exists) as well as libsyntax.\n\nThere may be other constants like this as well - I've only just started working with the api.\n",
