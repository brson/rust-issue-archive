    "body": "After reading the files `libsyntax/ext/source_util.rs` and `libsyntax/coremap.rs`, I have come up with a plan.\nThis is a little bit tricky, since with `include_str!`, we know that we are including utf-8 content, so it's safe to store the source as a String in a `FileMap`.  We don't know that for `include_bytes!`, but I don't think we actually need to track the contents anyways, so I'm passing `\"\"` to `new_filemap`.\nCurrently building, I'll see if that fixes it.\n",
