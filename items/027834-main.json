  "body": "The test at http://is.gd/xHYV2z was extracted from the `qcollect-traits` package on crates.io. It fails to compile due to a false ambiguity between the higher-ranked where-clause and the other one. This is particularly frustrating because the ambiguity occurs as part of projection and the higher-ranked where clause doesn't even list a binding for `Output`.\n\nThe correct fix is probably to prune one where clause or the other as part of selection, but this is a bit tricky with the current region setup due to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21974.\n\n``` rust\npub trait ImmutableSequenceTypes<'a, T:'a>{\n    type Output;\n}\n\npub trait MutableSequenceTypes<'a, T:'a>: ImmutableSequenceTypes<'a, T> {\n}\n\nfn foo<'t,X,T:'t>()\n    where X: for<'a> ImmutableSequenceTypes<'a, T>,\n          X: ImmutableSequenceTypes<'t, T, Output=&'t T>\n{\n    bar::<<X as ImmutableSequenceTypes<'t,T>>::Output>();\n}\n\nfn bar<A>() { }\n\nfn main() { }\n```\n\n(Due to this bug, PR #27641 causes a regression in `qcollect-traits`, but the problem is pre-existing.)\n",
