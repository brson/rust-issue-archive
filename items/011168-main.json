  "body": "- Pass `&ExtCtxt` instead of `@ExtCtxt`.\n- Stop passing duplicate parameters around in `expand`.\n- Make `ast_fold` methods take `&mut self`.\n\nAfter these, it should be possible to remove the `@mut` boxes from `ExtCtxt` altogether, though #11167 is doing some of that so I'm holding off on that for now. This will probably conflict with that PR, so I'm guessing that one will have to be rebased on top of the other.\n\nr? @pcwalton\n",
