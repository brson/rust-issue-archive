  "body": "On some systems (iOS for example) mutex is represented by opaque data structure which doesn't play well with simple data copy. Therefore mutex should be initialized from magic static value and filled by OS only when it landed RC.\n\nInitially written for iOS but since landing iOS support might require quite a lot of time I think it is better to split parts which aren't directly related to iOS and merge them in\n",
