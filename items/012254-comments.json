    "body": "@alexcrichton re a discussion we had the other day, I don't think that using the event loop for backoff sleeping is just as bad as completely going to sleep, since the real problem with schedulers sleeping is that it forces other schedulers to wake them up; as long as sleeping doesn't involve broadcasting that you need to be woken up there should still be perf wins. So I'm still worried about the message-handling latency of using usleep for this.\n\nOn another note, schedulers now do 2 types of sleeping which makes talking about either difficult.\n",
