  "body": "### DO NOT MERGE NEEDS AN APPROVED RFC.\n- The `Pod` trait is used to mark types that can be cloned by simply copying its bytes on the stack.\n- The `Copy` trait is used to mark types that are implictly copyable.\n- `Pod` can only be derived by structs/enums whose fields are also `Pod`\n- `Copy` can only be derived by types that are `Pod`, i.e. `trait Copy: Pod {}`\n- To avoid a massive breakage, the `#[derive(Copy)]` syntax extension now derives _both_ the `Pod` and `Copy` traits.\n- A `#[derive(Pod)]` syntax extension have been added to derive the `Pod` trait\n- `Cell<T>`'s `T: Copy` bound has been relaxed to `T: Pod`, this lets you use it with a wider variety of types like iterators, which are not implicitly copyable.\n\n[breaking-change]s\n- If you were manually implementing the `Copy` trait, you'll have to manually implement `Pod` as well:\n\n``` diff\n  impl<T> Copy for MyType<T> {}\n+ impl<T> Pod for MyType<T> {}\n```\n- To have `#![derive(Copy)]` expand into _two_ items, it was necessary to change the unstable `#[derive]` API. This will likely break third-party `#[derive]` extensions.\n\n---\n\n~~I plon to finish writing a proper RFC by tomorrow, but here's the [current draft](https://gist.github.com/japaric/7357578eec950cb89339).~~\n[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/936)\n\ncc @aturon @nikomatsakis @tbu-\ncc #21846\n",
