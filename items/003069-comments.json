    "body": "This looks great. Merged to incoming.\n\nRight now I don't have a need to make the arguments to encode_form_url sendable.\n\nI did some significant rebasing to clean up the history. I realize that you had a difficult merge with several changes hitting this module at the same time, but I would prefer to see a cleaner history because they are easier to review and understand (and just for the sake of cleanliness). Generally I try to rebase a branch off of incoming before pushing or, if it doesn't rebase cleanly, then just a single merge at the end of the series. With frequent merges between branches it's difficult, when reviewing, to separate the work on the branch from the work on trunk.\n\nThanks!\n",
