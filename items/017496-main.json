  "body": "This cuts the compilation time for a trivial Rust program by 15-20% on\nWindows due to a massive improvement in `rustc` start-up time. The debug\nlogging has a very high cost because it makes extensive use of mutable\nglobal variables and those result in expensive relocations.\n\nCreating debug builds by default discourages the usage of debug\nassertions. The few debug assertions not removed before landing a pull\nrequest are a significant performance problem for types like `RefCell`.\n\nThe defaults should cater to users or packagers building Rust rather\nthan compiler developers. A compiler developer can be expected to\noverride a default flag, but the same cannot be said of someone who\nlacks the same in-depth knowledge of the project.\n\nEven someone working on the standard libraries is not going to want to\npay the high cost for debug logging. Many people who contribute to the\ncompiler don't use the feature either, because a debugger tends to work\na lot better than inconsistent / bit-rotted logging code.\n",
