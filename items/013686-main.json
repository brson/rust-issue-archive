  "body": "This alters the borrow checker's requirements on invoking closures from\nrequiring an immutable borrow to requiring a unique immutable borrow. This means \nthat it is illegal to invoke a closure through a `&` pointer because there is no \nguarantee that is not aliased. This does not mean that a closure is required to\nbe in a mutable location, but rather a location which can be proven to be\nunique (often through a mutable pointer).\n\nFor example, the following code is unsound and is no longer allowed:             \n\n```\ntype Fn<'a> = ||:'a;                                                         \n\nfn call(f: |Fn|) {                                                           \n    f(|| {                                                                   \n        f(|| {})                                                             \n    });                                                                      \n}                                                                            \n\nfn main() {                                                                  \n    call(|a| {                                                               \n        a();                                                                 \n    });                                                                      \n}                                                                            \n```\n\nThere is no replacement for this pattern. For all closures which are stored in\nstructures, it was previously allowed to invoke the closure through `&self` but\nit now requires invocation through `&mut self`.\n\nThe standard library has a good number of violations of this new rule, but the\nfixes will be separated into multiple breaking change commits.\n\nCloses #12224                                                                    \n",
