How about adding an option to the test framework to write out the test results to a file, in some serialised format. \"make check\" could then write each of these out to a file (which is cleaned by make clean), and then at the end run a python script to read them all in and summarise.\n\nI'm happy to do this work if this design is sound?\n",
