There's quite a lot going on in there, and it'd be much easier to review if all the changes were split apart from each other.\n\nThis will also need some tests before merging. There's a number of `force-host` tests, but this commit should in theory allow lifting that restriction. It would be nice to have tests of some other form as well, but removing the `force-host` parameter would be a good start.\n\ncc #12102\n",

    "body": "Sure, but the second request poses a bit of a problem: as a requirement of removing some `ignore-*` in the tests that import a crate in both phases, libsyntax has to be available for both host & target so that `extern crate syntax` can resolve, despite the fact that it isn't used during link/runtime. Additionally, some tools, like rust-bindgen, need access to libsyntax anyway, which currently stipulates an -L argument to rustc's set of crates; I would argue that Rust would benefit from libsyntax co-existing as a target crate & host crate.\n\nFrankly, I feel that this exposes a larger issue (note I'm only referring to #[macro_registrar] crates here; macro_rules! extensions obviously don't suffer from this issue): data does not cross the phase boundary. They clearly don't belong in the same crate together, so why should it even be allowed?\n\nI actually resolved to creating a RFC wherein I propose a distinct crate type for syntax extensions, but blah! When ever is there time?\n",

    "body": "Its a result of the fact that rustc doesn't consider syntax phase crates separate from link phase crates except during `extern crate` time. You're right though; it is an issue, and a design level issue at that.\n\nConsider this test: https://github.com/DiamondLovesYou/rust/blob/filesearch/src/test/run-pass-fulldeps/phase-syntax-link-does-resolve.rs. This test references an aux crate: https://github.com/DiamondLovesYou/rust/blob/filesearch/src/test/auxiliary/macro_crate_test.rs. Now, speaking on a strictly theoretical basis, you're right, it doesn't depend on libsyntax during link phase. However, due to rustc's lack of crate role differentiation (the issue to which I referred to in the second paragraph in https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13450#issuecomment-40669212), rustc stipulates target access to libsyntax, which means libsyntax needs to also be a target crate.\n",

    "body": "`macro_crate_test::foo()` doesn't do anything that requires libsyntax. Neither do any of the other tests that test #[phase(syntax, link)] functionality. IDK if that was intentional or not, however in my experience (others may have differing resultant conclusions, verily) the roles/functions of syntax and link phases in crates is a disjoint set, though typically in support of one another. And then only the syntax phase side actually needs libsyntax. Again, I'm referring exclusively to #[macro_registrar].\n\nAt any rate, user crates wishing to cross compile while importing crates in both phases will run into the same problems (without additional changes): libsyntax won't be available as a target crate, stipulating an additional -L argument.\n\nBut back to your comment, it would defeat the whole purpose of this PR. _EDIT_: Well, the desired goal. \n\nI'm curious though, what, exactly, are the objections to including libsyntax in the set of TARGET_CRATES, even if only as a temporary measure util a better general solution is proposed, discussed, and ratified by the community/Rust team?\n",

    "body": "Hm, let me explain myself a bit more.\n\nIn today's world, a crate has a dependent set of crates. These are all declared with `extern crate`. If you link to a crate, you link to all of its dependencies as well. The `#[phase(syntax)]` indicator means _do not link_ but rather _only read metadata_ and dlopen() the crate if necessary. If `#[phase(syntax, link)]` is provided, then you both dlopen the crate _and_ link to the target crate afterwards.\n\nThis does not make sense for syntax extensions using procedural macros. There is rarely a need to have a runtime dependency on libsyntax. Any tests currently doing this are getting lucky, and they should not be doing this for cross compilation.\n\nIn a future world, this will not be the case, but we aren't quite there yet. This patch is fixing a real problem, however, which is that when you are targeting arm form x86, you will attempt to dlopen() arm syntax extension crates. You should instead dlopen() x86 syntax extension crates.\n\nDoes that make sense? There is no need to support linking to libsyntax on targets, that's not the underlying bug which I thought this was trying to fix.\n",
