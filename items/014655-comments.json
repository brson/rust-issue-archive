    "body": "FWIW, I am contributor to the [cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) library for Python. You can consider taking the approach we did here and design a \"pluggable\" API that bindings existing C libraries. For a general purpose crypto library, NaCL is almost definitely not a good fit because common algorithms aren't present in it. While there has been much bad press about OpenSSL lately, it is really _the_ most viable library to wrap since it is available on all common platforms and almost certainly already installed on Linux distros. The current scrutiny on it should do well to turn up security bugs as well. Our API also allows other C libraries to be used (we bind commoncrypto on OS X as well, and I have PolarSSL bindings in the works.)\n\nIf designed well, I can see the potential Rust crypto library at first being dependent on C bindings but eventually gets seamlessly replaced by Rust code without much backwards incompatibility.\n",

It's used in Firefox, after all.\n\n> My current opinion is that we should not distribute any crypto written in Rust\n\nI can understand why for some things, but then choosing OpenSSL at this point would make most people wonder what's the point of Rust after all.\nAnyways, I don't see why not implement things like digests in rust straight away (and they are already in rust-crypto, for that matter, I've been using Sha1, Md5 and Hmac from there). Sure, that would be redundant with whatever library whose bindings would be distributed, but so could be said of a lot of things in the standard library, as being redundant with the system libc.\n",

    "body": "Do not use NSS. The actual cryptography bits of NSS are not even close to being on par with the OpenSSL (LibreSSL/BoringSSL) implementations. For example, OpenSSL has constant-time implementations of ECC private key operations and NSS doesn't. Also, OpenSSL has many more assembly-language optimized implementations of algorithms that can only be efficiently and safely implemented in assembly language, whereas NSS has only a few. Also, the recommended API to NSS is pk11wrap, which is a wrapper around NSS's PKCS#11 interface, which is a wrapper around the actual crypto code (freebl). The PKCS#11 wrapper is a huge amount of complicated, hard-to-decipher, unnecessarily inefficient code. And, the PKCS#11-based design means that certain optimizations (e.g. AES-GCM optimizations necessary for efficient implementation of AES-GCM TLS cipher suites) are difficult or impossible to do.\n\nIn general, the OpenSSL implementations of the low-level crypto primitives that would be used in a a browser are the best or on their way to becoming the best soon. The stuff on top of those low-level primitives leaves a lot to be desired. Also, like I mentioned above, a lot of that code is in assembly language by necessity. Therefore, I think it is useful to consider the idea of creating Rust wrappers around the low-level primitives of some branch of OpenSSL, whether it is LibreSSL or BoringSSL or whatever, perhaps throwing much of the rest of OpenSSL away.\n",

It's an evolving library that's constantly adding new features. Vendoring it into the Rust standard library would reduce agility around updates as it would only get updated along with the standard library.\n\nFurthermore, NaCl/libsodium alone doesn't provide a comprehensive cryptography story. While I agree djb's ciphers are totally awesome, there are people with compliance obligations around cryptography (e.g. HIPAA) who have to use NIST ciphers, and may have even more stringent obligations like FIPS 140-2. I think FIPS sucks, but until the laws are changed there's not much that can be done about it.\n\nI say this all as the maintainer of the most popular Ruby binding to libsodium (RbNaCl). I also package libsodium as a RubyGem. I think it would make way more sense for libsodium and a Rust binding to get packaged via Cargo. In fact, I just shipped a RubyGem of libsodium 0.6.0 this morning. (Also I designed the libsodium logo ;)\n\nThis is where a provider architecture is nice. You can use both more \"traditional\" libraries like OpenSSL and more modern libraries like libsodium/NaCl through a single, pluggable API. I've been working on a library like this for Ruby... perhaps I could work on a Rust version too? ;)\n",

    "body": "I made a remark about this issue in my talk at Mozilla SF in December 2014 and I just wanted to clarify.\n\nMy remark was specifically that Rust should not have an in-tree crypto story, and it highlighted this issue.\n\nThis comes with some caveats. My intended point was about implementing _ciphers_ (and crypto-protocols built on them) in-tree, and saying I thought that was a bad idea. My analogy was to Ruby's OpenSSL extension, which is a binding to OpenSSL that is an intractable part of the standard library. There is an effort underway to rip OpenSSL out of the Ruby standard library and move it into an out-of-tree external package.\n\nRust has various in-tree APIs for _hash functions_ (e.g. `std::hash`) and I think these are non-controversial and totally fine. In fact I think `std::hash::Hasher` is great and one of the other remarks I made in my talk is I totally want to see more traits like this.\n\ntl;dr: hash functions are fine, but please leave encryption ciphers and public-key digital signature algorithms (and _especially_ crypto protocols!) to out-of-tree libraries developed by crypto experts.\n",

    "body": "First, there is one hash function you absolutely do want in the standard library: something like [SipHash](https://131002.net/siphash/) to use as the basis of a (hashDoS-resistant) hashing function:\n\nhttp://doc.rust-lang.org/0.11.0/collections/hash/sip/fn.hash.html\n\nWithout a cryptographically secure hash function like SipHash, any time an attacker provides the data to be put into e.g. a `HashMap`, they can potentially collide the buckets the data is placed into, intentionally causing poor algorithmic performance, DoSing the application. This is hashDoS.\n\nSecondly, having hash functions in the standard library also gets you around the bootstrapping problem of how to verify artifacts in the package manager for the language itself.\n",
