    "body": "Triage: the privacy checker was recently rewritten to fix half of this and the other half is by design. The following now runs:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Outer {\n  number: int\n}\n\nmod inner {\n  use super::Outer;\n  pub fn run_from_outside() {\n    let _ = Outer { number: 42 };\n  }\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test() {\n  use inner::run_from_outside;\n  run_from_outside();\n}\n```\n\nNote the `pub fn run_from_outside`. Private things can be used in children, but an item needs to be public to be used by the parent (although the child module itself doesn't have to be `pub`). Closing.\n",
