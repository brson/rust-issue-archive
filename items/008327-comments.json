There is nothing besides the rest of the stuff in `sync` that needs to use it.\n\nPlease poke me on IRC so we can discuss how to organize these modules. I think we have drastically different views of what the final version should end up looking like.\n",

We still have our disagreements about when modules should be split up into multiple files, and how encapsulated classes should be but I've compromised on a much less drastic change that would allow a possible split up if needed but does not split up sync.rs yet.\n\n@bblum So I've changed the pull request.\n",
