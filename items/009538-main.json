  "body": "This is broken, and results in poor performance due to the undefined\nbehaviour in the LLVM IR. LLVM's `mergefunc` is a _much_ better way of\ndoing this since it merges based on the equality of the bytecode.\n\nFor example, consider `std::repr`. It generates different code per\ntype, but is not included in the type bounds of generics.\n\nThe `mergefunc` pass works for most of our code but currently hits an\nassert on libstd. It is receiving attention upstream so it will be\nready soon, but I don't think removing this broken code should wait any\nlonger. I've opened #9536 about enabling it by default.\n\nCloses #8651\nCloses #3547\nCloses #2537\nCloses #6971\nCloses #9222\n",
