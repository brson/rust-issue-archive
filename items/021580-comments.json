The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the PR! Unfortunately APIs such as this are against the [I/O design principles](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0517-io-os-reform.md#design-principles) by exposing implementation details that are only available on some platforms and not others. Additionally the `std::io` module is being redesigned right now and is in a great state of flux.\n\nWe'd love to support APIs such as this but for now we're likely going to conservatively only allow going from a `File` to a file descriptor via an extension trait in `std::os::$platform`. I'm going to close this for now as it should probably wait for more of I/O reform to land ahead of time, but feel free to comment on the RFC when it comes up! Right now we don't have an RFC for `std::fs`, but it should appear soon :)\n",
