    "body": "I've been playing around with this a little, and have ran into some trouble.\n\nThe heuristic I've been trying to implement is to look for BinOp('>', BinOp('<', A, B), C) where A looks like a function or method call, B is the unresolved name(`int`), and C is an ExprParen or a LitNil.\n\nI've managed to access the ast_map from resolve.rs (where the error occurs), but have run into an issue where ast_map::Map's get_parent function returns the NodeId of main as the parent of `int`, meaning I can't really inspect the ast around the site of the error. Is there a better way to try and find AST elements (or alternately, is get_parent misbehaving)? I couldn't come up with a workable heuristic that didn't involve having some knowledge about the code surrounding the unresolved name.\n",
