    "body": "After doing some searching I cannot find a way to actually set the ELF ABI from GCC/LD's command line; but the FreeBSD dudes luckily have a wonderful utility known as [brandelf](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/usr.bin/brandelf/brandelf.c?rev=1.27;content-type=text%2Fplain) which can do this for you. It's trivially compilable on Linux (with a few modifications,) and then you can set the ABI back to SVR4 by saying:\n\n```\n$ ./brandelf -t SVR4 ./a.out\n```\n\nThis of course only applies to snapshots, since on old systems the linker will build using SVR4 ABI anyway. Doing it this way of course adds another step in the process of building snapshots, but as that seems like a rather infrequent event I think it's fine.\n\nIf this seems like an OK route (I think it's fine considering it's very self contained and just uses `libelf` for the heavy lifting,) I'll cook up a patch to add `brandelf.c` to the build system and run it over the snapshots.\n",
