    "body": "@wowus: We do need to decide on the best way to do this though. Passing the size to `free` and `realloc` will preserve the ability to avoid allocation for the zero-size case. I'm thinking we could do this:\n\n``` rust\nstatic EMPTY: () = ();\nstatic EMPTY_PTR: *mut u8 = &EMPTY as *() as *mut u8;\n\nfn alloc(size: uint) -> *mut u8 {\n    if size == 0 {\n        EMPTY_PTR\n    } else {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nfn free(ptr: *mut u8, size: uint) {\n    if size != 0 {\n        libc::free(ptr);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `realloc` function would also need to take the old size as a parameter. This will require altering the `exchange_malloc` lang item to take a length and removing the glue collapsing for `~T` where T is `Pod`. An allocator can take advantage of the size passed to `free` to find the right pool without as much work.\n\nAlternatively, `free` _could_ compare against `EMPTY_PTR` but this will not optimize out as the size check will in the general case. The `free` wrapper needs to be inlined for dead store elimination to work so it's not a one time cost.\n",

I think we can also guarantee that any allocation which has zero-size will never be dereferenced or freed and just some non-zero value. This will require that when converting `Vec<T>` to `~[T]`, we check for length zero and eagerly free the array (and similarly if we chose to support `pop()` on `~[T]`).\n",

    "body": "@thestinger Indeed. I commented a bit eagerly, I suppose. I read the whole thread now and have some questions:\n1. The only case where we do not know statically whether to call `free` is with `[]` and `Trait`, correct?\n2. When calling realloc, you say that the size parameter will be optimized away in the common case, but that is not clear to me. We call realloc to grow vectors, and we will (typically) not generally know whether the vector has zero length or not, right? Well, I suppose there is the case of `~[()]` to consider. I guess overall my point is that I'm not sure that fixing this _within_ realloc and free etc is the right place, vs the caller.\n\nOTOH, if we can add size checks to free and \"fix it once\", that is preferable. In any case, I expect we will continue to supply exact sizes to malloc/free (you've convinced me that this makes sense), though I think not all allocators will necessarily care.\n",
