    "body": "Your file manager is buggy and doesn't know how to run executables with ASLR support. It's using the output of `file` or libmagic which will detect relocatable executables as shared objects. There's nothing Rust can do about that.\n\nRust defaults to producing position independent executables to enable [ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization). This can be enabled with `gcc` or `clang` by using `-fPIE` to build object files and `-pie` to link them and is the default on some distributions. The `gcc` and `clang` default can be replicated with `rustc` using `-C dynamic-no-pic` but it's not likely that you want that.\n",
