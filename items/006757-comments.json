    "body": "Changing `strip_doc_comment_decoration()` to also return an enum representing the type of doc comment it was seemed like the path of least resistance here, but rustdoc having to be aware of the different kinds of lexical syntaxes of doc attributes isn't really all that elegant. The approach of modifying the lexer or the parser to merge multiple line comments into one doc attribute so that rustdoc could just emit blank lines between any two doc attributes wasn't popular in `#rust` at all though. Thoughts?\n",
