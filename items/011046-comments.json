The 2nd make ensures that the lib is not build again if dependencies weren't updated. The 2nd make failed because it did rebuild the lib even if it shouldn't. Strange thing is, that it rebuilt the lib because it didn't exist, which shouldn't happen at all. \n\nSince it worked before, my guess would be that either the 2nd make is expecting a different filename than the 1st produced (i.e. --lib produced a different file than --crate-file-name prints out), or maybe there's an issue with relative paths and/or the cwd (since the previous version used absolute paths)\n",
