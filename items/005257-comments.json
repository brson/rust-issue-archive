If everyone follows this rule, everything is fine.  Deriving iter bytes will help here, of course, because it will follow this rule implicitly.\n",

That would be the, mm, most direct way to address this ticket, I think.\n\nBut @nikomatsakis has posted a more general principle, I think it was meant for `IterBytes` as a whole.  It sounded rather like what you would need to implement a type-based value serialization mechanism.  (Don't we already have one or more serialization traits?)  The `IterBytes` trait is solely documented as being in place to support `Hash`, which to me means that there is a lot of freedom in how one implements it.   Maybe I am mistaken in drawing a connection between serialization and `IterBytes`.\n\nAnyway, does anyone have feedback on niko's suggestion?\n",

I originally wanted to remove iterbytes, but in the discussion on #8038, I think we sort of settled on the idea that iter-bytes is basically a specialized serialization for the purposes of hashing, which is usually the same thing but not always. @erickt pointed out that the serialization API includes some higher-level methods for things like maps and so forth that are not particularly well-suited to hashing -- basically that in general-purpose serialization, we might allow more license than we would want for hashing. _shrug_ I guess there is no reason to shoehorn everything into one trait, so long as have deriving modes.\n",

I can't find any explicit IterBytes impl that would not be fixed by that (str uses vec).\n\nFor short strings, it might have an impact. That's 8 bytes more to hash. One way to do it might be to use a terminator instead, like `f(self.as_bytes()) && f([0xFF])`. There are a number of bytes that can not appear in UTF-8 and not in str.\n",
