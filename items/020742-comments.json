    "body": "The `type` synonym is just a transparent alias, so it has no bearing on this.\n\nIt's expected behavior that you can't implement `Default` for `[uint; 1]`, when both are from the standard library. This is part of the \"coherence\" rules on traits.  One reason for the restriction is that another crate might have a conflicting implementation, and this would cause problems when those crates are used together.\n",
