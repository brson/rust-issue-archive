    "body": "I think it's actually safe: moving the `RefCell` (i.e taking `self` by-value) requires that there are no existing borrows, and both `.borrow()` and `.borrow_mut()` store borrows, so it's impossible to call `unwrap` while either of those exist. The `debug_assert!` is just a final check to ensure that `RefCell` is maintaining its own invariants.\n\nIf you adjust this patch to leave the `debug_assert!` as is, but add a comment describing the above for future readers, I'll r+ in a flash since it's definitely subtle.\n",
