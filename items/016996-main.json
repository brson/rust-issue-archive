  "body": "SEME is short for \"single-entry/multiple-exit\".\n\nThis patch contains no functional changes, because all intersection and\nunion operations on SEME regions convert SEME regions to scopes and use\nthe old scope-based intersection/union logic on those scopes. However,\nthis patch does take the full generality of SEME regions into account\nwhen computing the gen/kill bits for the data flow analysis used in the\nborrow check. Once the correct intersection and union operations land\n(possibly using the dominator tree infrastructure), then non-lexical\nborrows (issue #6393) will begin to work. Therefore, this patch\nestablishes most of the groundwork for non-lexical borrows.\n\nBecause this patch refactors the AST to index pattern arms (which is\nnecessary to make non-lexical borrows work in the data flow analysis for\ncommon cases), it can break compiler plugins.\n\nr? @nikomatsakis\nf? @zwarich\n",
