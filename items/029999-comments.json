Or did it just start as a refactoring?\n- Are there fixes which need to go upstream to the external term?\n\nI hope to soon have a branch to at least start out building the compiler with Cargo at which point integration with the upstream libterm should be much easier, so I'm a little wary to put a lot of effort into the internal libterm if it's largely just refactorings (e.g. just a bunch of extra churn)\n",

Based on @Stebalien comment to bring across some of the other fixes made in term this has grown in scope. This should bring in a number of other changes and fixes from term such as those in https://github.com/Stebalien/term/commit/c62def53fbe3808ab14c4e382493afcd80879675 and https://github.com/Stebalien/term/commit/031b0eb86abbee0146c89ee03d77eea7746b27c7.\n\nNothing from this should go upstream to term, it should all be alterations already made in term. There is some ugliness in terms of not all of the changes being able to be brought across (due to cargo deps; mainly the Terminal trait hasn't got all its new functionality), so this is a combination of the old libterm and new changes from term.\n",
