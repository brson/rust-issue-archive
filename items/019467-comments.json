    "body": "@japaric \n\nFirst, thanks as always for your amazing work moving the libraries forward with these new language features!\n\nI talked with @alexcrichton and @nikomatsakis a bit about our strategy, and we had a few thoughts:\n- Functions consuming closures should essentially always take them generically (as you're doing)\n- Functions yielding closures should, in general, be using a newtype to hide the implementation choice. In particular, the various `pub type` definitions for iterators like `Values` should all be changed to be newtypes hiding their implementation and providing their own `Iterator` impl. (This is a workaround until we have [a better mechanism](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/105) for doing this hiding.) This newtype work is something we're doing as part of API stabilization, but in many cases we haven't gotten to it yet. Please convert cases like this (`Keys`, `Values`, etc) to newtypes.\n- The use of internal free fns to have a nameable type as you're using in a few places here shouldn't be necessary: we should be able to provide an implementation of `Fn(X) -> Y` for `Box<Fn(X) -> Y>`, for example, and so you should be able to just write `.map(box |(k, _)| k)`. (As with your current implementation, this will involve dynamic dispatch, which is bad, but there's essentially no way around that with our current plans for what's available on the Stable channel).\n\nSo, I'd suggest adding an implementation of the `Fn` traits for boxes `Fn` values and using `box` rather than manually creating local bare fns -- which should be less work anyway :-)\n\nPlease let me know if any of that is unclear.\n",

    "body": "> Functions yielding closures should, in general, be using a newtype to hide the implementation choice. \n\nCould this be done in a follow up PR? This quite a bit of work, not only we must make the wrapper implement `Iterator`, but also `DoubleEndedIterator`, `RandomAccessIterator`, `ExactSizeIterator`,  `Clone`, and/or any other trait that the type alias \"transparently\" implements today.\n\n> you should be able to just write .map(box |(k, _)| k)\n\nWhich implementation should be in the standard library:\n- `impl FnOnce<Args, Results> for Box<F> where F: FnOnce<Args, Results> { .. }`, or\n- `impl FnOnce<Args, Results> for Box<FnOnce<Args, Results> + 'static> { .. }`\n\nIf the later, then won't we need to write `.map(box |(k, _)| k as Box<FnOnce(_) -> _ + 'static)` instead? I don't think that `box || {}` gets automatically coerced to a trait object.\n\nAnyhow, due to #19032/#18835, I can't implement either right now. Can we move forward with the bare functions? Or should we block on #19032 getting fixed?\n",

For example, this change adds type parameters to a fair number of structs that we would probably be equally happy to just put boxed closures in.

    "body": "> I'm curious whether all uses of explicit closure notation (|&: ...| and move) are needed.\n\nWell, in most cases I added the explicit notation to avoid compiler errors, but I may have over annotated in some places.\n\nAlso, IIRC, @nikomatsakis mentioned (in his blog post, I think) that he wanted/planned to improve the inference of the \"generic\" `|| {}` syntax to not require the explict `move`/`&:` notation. But, I'm not sure how hard it would be implement that (i.e. if it can be done for 1.0). I do expect that the following code will work as soon as we drop the boxed closures:\n\n``` rust\nfn f<F>(_: F) where F: Fn() {}\n\nfn main() {\n    let closure = || {};   // currently, this defaults to a boxed closure\n    f(closure);  // currently, errors with `Fn` trait is not implemented for `||` type\n}\n```\n\nWhich is one of main cases for explicit closure annotation (`&:`).\n\nIf we can improve the `|| {}` inference, then I think we can remove most of the explicit annotations.\n\n> This also leaves me somewhat curious what our long term conventions around boxing will be.\n\nSo, one \"advantage\" of storing a bare function (`fn()`) or an unboxed closure instead of a boxed closure (`Box<Fn()>`) in a struct like `Bytes`, an alias of `Map`, is that in the former case the struct can implement `Copy`. Though not everyone likes implicitly copyable structs, specially [iterators](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18045).\n\nThere are also some places where can simply not use boxed closures, like `libcore`, since there is no `Box` there.\n\n---\n\nI'll rebase this ASAP.\n\n(BTW, I also wanted to add `#[deriving(Clone, Copy)]` to several structs that now contain unboxed closures (this would fix issues like #12677), but this patch is already too big. So, I'll do that in another PR.)\n",
