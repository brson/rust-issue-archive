    "body": "There are no mutable strings. If you mean `\"\"` and `~\"\"`, the comparison failing between them presently is a bug in type inference surrounding the `==` operator and will eventually be fixed. Or at least this is Niko's assessment. I'm assigning to him in the meantime but I expect this bug will solve itself. You can work around it using `str::eq_slice()` for now (which itself should be merged with `str::eq`). Apologies, the `str` module is still in transition from earlier work on it during the summer.\n",
