Most functions that implemented the for protocol were forced, as LLVM has issues there. The majority of operator overloads are forced, a couple of functions that had a comment saying that they should be forced. Everything else is marked with just inline. \n\nThe major reason for many of the inlined functions is to get it to output the AST for cross-crate inlining.\n\nLLVM will potentially inline any function if it thinks it will help. \n",

    "body": "@brson as @bstrie pointed out, 'force' sounds more \"dire\". The idea is that 'force' actually better describes what your are doing. I mean, sure they mean the same thing, but you are actually forcing the compiler to inline the function. 'always' still seems like a request, it's too off-hand with respect to what you are asking. 'always' also suggests that the developer knows what they are doing, and when it comes to this kind of optimization. They normally don't.\n\nMost tools that have a 'force' option, have it as a way to override some default safety check, be it pushing a diverged branch in `git`, or removing read-only files with `rm`. They use 'force' because it changes the default sensible behaviour at the expense of the tool throwing it's hands up and saying \"Ok, ok, you're the boss, but don't come crying to me when things go sour\". Inlining is a tool, and most of the time, a normal `#[inline]` will suffice. Both `#[inline(force)]` and `#[inline(never)]` are assertions that you know what you are doing.\n\nLastly, people have abused the feature, marking rather large functions as `#[inline(always)]`, presumably out of an almost cargo-cult attitude regarding performance. As I understand it, this stems from it's usage on iterator functions in `vec` where the generated code played havoc with LLVM's inlining heuristics, resulting performance issues.\n\ntl;dr: `#[inline(always)]` is too nice, `#[inline(force)]` sounds scary. Maybe this will make people think about what they are doing.\n\n# \n\n(P.S. I will rebase if/when this gets provisionally approved)\n",
