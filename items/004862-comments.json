    "body": "@catamorphism That's a good point, and no I don't think so. I think turning debug info tests off if configure doesn't find gdb would be appropriate. We could also turn the gdb tests off by default (like the perf tests) and just configure the bots to run them, but i prefer the former. I am going to take a stab at that - I want to try to put a big warning on the test output that some tests weren't run - but I'm going to r+ this anyway to see how the bots feel about gdb.\n",
