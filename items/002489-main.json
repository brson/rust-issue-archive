  "body": "- Cargo now always works in ~/.cargo so you don't need a chain of root permissions to just use stuff (unless installing/uninstalling a package at system level). Closes #2475.\n- Removed mode option. It's pointless when you have -g and -G. Always works at local level by default when installing / uninstalling. Always work at user level for anything else. \n- Cargo now automatically inits and syncs when running for the first time. Closes #1353.\n- Cargo now has a (weak) uninstall command. It works the same as install when it comes to working out what level you are working at. Once dependencies are implemented (as described in #1356), I am assuming that there will be a local cache of all the packages installed. Until then, this command simply works off the metadata name / uuid and does a really weak pattern match in the lib/bin directories to find what library files to delete. Unfortunately, without a locale cache of information about packages installed, binaries can only be uninstalled by name.\n\n``` sh\ncargo uninstall mre # uninstalls by metadata name\ncargo uninstall b85803ee-819d-4b9d-adcd-ed8e356ceee3 # uninstalls by metadata uuid\n```\n- Cargo now uses pretty colours, like rustc. All the error/info/warn messages were changed to be lower case and period-less to match rustc too.\n- The cargo install command now accepts a pretty universal range of commands:\n\n``` sh\ncargo install # installs from the working directory\ncargo install rustray\ncargo install central/rustray\ncargo install c89c5834-63db-4a6e-8e0a-d75985b1730e # rustray uuid\ncargo install central/c89c5834-63db-4a6e-8e0a-d75985b1730e\ncargo install ../blah/somepkg.tar.gz\ncargo install http://blah.com/somepkg.tar.gz\ncargo install ftp://blah.com/somepkg.tar.gz\ncargo install git://github.com/brson/rustray\ncargo install http://github.com/brson/rustray.git\n```\n- The list command now prints out a prettier version of a summary of a source:\n\n```\ninfo: central (https://raw.github.com/mozilla/cargo-central/master/packages.json)\n   >> cairo, crypto, csv, elasticsearch, glfw, llvm, mecab, mongrel2, mre, mustache, \n   >> pcre, rparse, rust-hello, rustgl_4_2_core, rustic, rustray, rustx, sdl, socket, \n   >> sqlite, time, tnetstring, uri, uuid, zlib, zmq\n```\n",
