    "body": "Well const support in type classes at first is necessary to have f32, f64, float versions of the mathematical constants (pi, e).  In order to avoid loss of precision, it may be a good idea to provide these constants as loss free hexadecimal float literals (see #1443). This will ensure that rust's and C's idea of pi, e etc. are identical.  Beyond that, libm is pretty generic in what kind of representation of floating point numbers is used by the C compiler (different radix, different size of mantissa, Non-IEEE formats).  Thus again, to avoid loss of precision, on such a platform it may be desirable to give the constants in a loss-free form for that platform.\n",
