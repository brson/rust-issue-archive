    "body": "This is a consequence of hygiene: the macro is looking for the identifier `v` (in some sense, the \"original\" `v`, even though there's no value corresponding to the \"original\" `v`), but `let` defines a new and different identifier.\n\nThis is similar to how keyword arguments behave in Racket:\n\n```\n-> (cond [else 1] [#t 2])\n; readline-input:5:6: cond: bad syntax (`else' clause must be last)\n-> (let [(else #f)] (cond [else 1] [#t 2]))\n2\n```\n\n...but not as sophisticated, as Racket allows you to define a `my-else` to play the same role as `else` did.\n\nOf course, \"but Racket does it that way\" isn't an automatic justification for everything macro-related. Maybe the Rust macro parser would make more sense if we were treating `v` as a \"custom token\" instead of an identifier. But I could also see this behavior being confusing if `v` were in a more \"expression-like\" position. But maybe in Rust macros, there are fewer \"expression-like\" positions? @jbclements, any thoughts?\n",

    "body": "Yes, that seems right to me. I think we should perform that comparison unhygienically.  I have a nagging feeling that this could cause unwanted behavior in sufficiently \"interesting\" situations--I'm thinking specifically of macros that expand into macro definitions. \n\nWell, this may be a non-issue; currently, even if we fix macros-that-define-macros, there's no way to use a pattern variable in another pattern--it would just be a new binding. To wit:\n\nmacro_rules!(($i:ident)=>(macro_rules!(($i : 3)=>(3))))\n\nAnyhow, WRT the bug report: I agree. We should compare these by name, not as identifiers. Is that a one-liner? \n\n... sigh...\n",
