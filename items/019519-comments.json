For now yeah I'm just [deleting libmingwex.a](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/1010).\n\nI definitely still think we should install gcc by default, but having an option to opt-out would perhaps be nice (not a high priority at all).

    "body": "Today I've hit the issue with `strtok_r` being used by libcurl. I've built my libcurl using mingw-w64 v4.0.6. I don't know how to opt-out of installing mingw libs using rustup. I fixed it by replacing bundled libmingwex.a with the one from mingw-w64 v4.0.6.\nWhy bundled mingwex doesn't contain `strtok_r`? Is it outdated?\n\nEDIT: Looks like opting out of mingw installation is not yet implemented in rustup: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues/298\n",
