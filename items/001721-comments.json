    "body": "I like the look of it. The design I was thinking uses slightly different terminology and interface, but essentially the same idea:\n- `scheduler` is a container for threads and tasks. `domain` is a less-familiar term, and `thread` or `task_thread` is fine for a thread that runs tasks.\n- A scheduler is first-class. Users can make new ones and inject tasks into them. `spawn(f)` effectively does `task::get_current_scheduler().add_task(task::create(f))`\n- A thread is not first-class, as their lifecycle tends to be extremely platform-specific and it's not generally safe to start or kill one any old time you like. Users can, however, set policy about how many threads are active in a given scheduler. Three policies exist:\n  - `THREAD_PER_CORE` makes 1 thread per core and maps tasks to threads M:N\n  - `THREAD_PER_TASK` makes 1 thread per task.\n  - `MANUAL_THREADS` makes exactly as many threads as a user asks for.\n- By default there is one `THREAD_PER_CORE` scheduler.\n- Every C call takes the thread \"out of service\" from running tasks; we will _not_ switch-away from the calling task (even if we re-enter the runtime, or some task code, from a C callback) until the outermost C call completes. This means in a `THREAD_PER_CORE` scheduler, you should not call code that's going to block in C, if you want to avoid starving the scheduler of threads. Make a secondary scheduler in `MANUAL_THREADS` mode and put your blocking tasks in there.\n",
