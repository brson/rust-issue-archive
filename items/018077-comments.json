    "body": "> The current status implies that changing a public constant is an API breaking semver change.\n\nThis is true. However, constants in patterns are not the only scenario where that can happen. The following example demonstrates how that can occur in a different situation where the values are evaluated at compile time.\n\n``` rust\nuse X::{A, B};\n\nfn f() -> [uint, ..A] {\n    unreachable!()\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x: [uint, ..B] = f();\n}\n```\n\nI am going to close this issue as a dupe of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/4112.\n\nIn any case, a change of this type would warrant an RFC so if you are interested in pursuing this idea further and submitting a concrete proposal, the RFC process is described here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#what-the-process-is. Thanks!\n",
