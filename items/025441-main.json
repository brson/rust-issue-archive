  "body": "Debug overflow checks for arithmetic negation landed in #24500, at which time\nthe `abs` method on signed integers was changed to using `wrapping_neg` to\nensure that the function never panicked. This implied that `abs` of `INT_MIN`\nwould return `INT_MIN`, another negative value. When this change was back-ported\nto beta, however, in #24708, the `wrapping_neg` function had not yet been\nbackported, so the implementation was changed in #24785 to `!self + 1`. This\nchange had the unintended side effect of enabling debug overflow checks for the\n`abs` function. Consequently, the current state of affairs is that the beta\nbranch checks for overflow in debug mode for `abs` and the nightly branch does\nnot.\n\nThis commit alters the behavior of nightly to have `abs` always check for\noverflow in debug mode. This change is more consistent with the way the standard\nlibrary treats overflow as well, and it is also not a breaking change as it's\nwhat the beta branch currently does (albeit if by accident).\n\ncc #25378\n",
