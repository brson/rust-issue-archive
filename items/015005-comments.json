It would be annoying in some places, but it is not outside the realm of possibility.\n\n> Clang follows along with LLVM trunk and only the stable releases work with the corresponding LLVM stable release.\n\nOk, but our automation is very different, and has infrastructure has different needs. As I noted with the travis builds above, it is quite nice to be able to use a pre-installed LLVM for a variety of reasons.\n\nAgain though, it is not a requirement for us to be compatible with older LLVM, I want to make it clear that we are relying on older LLVM builds in numerous places today to understand what will happen if we break them. I also want to make it clear that supporting an older LLVM release doesn't mean holding off on all newer features of LLVM in the later versions.\n",

These can be overcome, I just want to make sure that we're aware of the consequences.\n\nInstalling a compatible version of LLVM in Travis is still possible. You could do a single build of LLVM, archive or package it and then make it available on rust-lang.org. Perhaps the snapshot builders could be responsible for doing this, but if it really still works as far back as 3.3 right now then it won't be hard to do it manually as-needed.\n",

(and include it as part of this PR)\n\nI updated LLVM to a version that includes the bugfix, no need to cherry-pick it. What I meant here was that instead of using a newer upstream, I'd backport only the bugfix commit.\n\nThe reason I thought of that was because of the cmpxchg change that is the reason why the update would break compatibility. But like you said, trans could actually just check which type cmpxchg has and translate the intrinsics that use it accordingly.\n",

The development model for `clang` is to follow along with trunk and then it is released in synchronization with LLVM.

It wouldn't mean that building LLVM is required.\n",
