    "body": "I've been on the fence about this for awhile. I think this is actually the third time I've seen this come up! I certainly like the negative diffstat on this, but I do think that there's a possibly major downside to this. As you've mentioned in #10008, none of these intrinsics are really unsafe at all (at least all the math ones). If we move to using `link_name` instead of compiler support, then there won't be any way to expose these as safe bindings to the equivalent LLVM functions.\n\nIt also seems a little odd to have half the intrinsics in the compiler and half of them using `link_name`, but that's not really a reason to not land this. What do you think about not being able to flag these as safe?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton: I think forcing all `extern` block functions to `unsafe` should be done with a default deny lint check so the minority of foreign functions that are safe for all inputs can still be exposed as safe. Of course, this isn't going to work for automatically generated C bindings via `libclang`, but it will work for these.\n\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10267\n\nC and LLVM functions don't match the Rust ABI since they're missing an environment pointer so for now you still do need a wrapper anyway... but at least most of those wrappers are already there to deal with the current `unsafe` issue. If we drop the environment pointer they can be directly exposed.\n",
