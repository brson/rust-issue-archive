    "body": "I both agree and disagree. On the one hand, I'm not particularly proud of it; it was just the only way I could think of to hide the internal types in `SelectInner`'s functions. Suggestions for other ways to do it welcome.\n\nOn the other hand, I see it less as \"select uses a type that doesn't exist\", and more as \"Select is an opaque trait, that is somehow/magically implemented by X, Y, and Z types of ports, which are the only things select() can be used on.\"\n",
