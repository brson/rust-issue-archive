The debug/info/warn/error log levels appear to be standard across pretty much all implementations/explanations that I could find:\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2031163/when-to-use-log-level-warn-vs-error\n- http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html\n- http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging//apidocs/org/apache/commons/logging/Log.html#fatal%28java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.Throwable%29\n- http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/logging.html\n\nAnd that was just for an immediate search of \"error log level\". If at all it seems that we're missing the `fatal!` and `trace!` log levels (although I'm not so sure about `trace!`).\n\nIn my opinion, the stackoverflow answer to what the log levels mean is a good summary of what each one is and specifically why `error!` shouldn't fail/die. I think that the fix for this issue should be better documentation about core macros rather than renaming them.\n",
