  "body": "I doubt this PR is ready to merge as-is, for a couple reasons:\n- There are no tests for this change. I'm not sure how to add tests for this change, as it modifies the C ABI for a cross-compilation target. Anecdotally, I have an iOS library I've been working on, and before this change, it crashes running on an arm64 device due to bad calling conventions (a simplified example is in #24154), and after this change, it runs correctly.\n- This is my first foray into LLVM. I did my best to reimplement what Clang does for AArch64 codegen (https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/master/lib/CodeGen/TargetInfo.cpp), particularly in `ABIInfo::isHomogeneousAggregate`, `AArch64ABIInfo::isHomogeneousAggregateBaseType`, and `AArch64ABIInfo::isHomogeneousAggregateSmallEnough`, but I'm not confident I got a complete translation, particularly because Clang includes a lot of checks that I don't believe are necessary for rustc.\n\nFixes #24154.\n",
