    "body": "So I can see a few ways to try to address the problem noted by @alexcrichton on travis.\n\nThe problem: travis for some reason does `CC=gcc ./configure --enable-clang`.  I was assuming that if someone sets `CC`, then they really want to use that as their compiler, and the `--enable-clang` thing should not change the choice of `CC`. However, I also figured we should preserve the current checks that validate that we are using a sufficiently new version of `clang`, and the way I decided to drive that check by the presence of the `--enable-clang` option.\n\nIn short: I was assuming that no one would both set `CC=gcc` and pass `--enable-clang`, but Travis does.\n\nSo, here are the main solutions I can see that still preserve the properties mentioned above (namely: that setting `CC` takes precedence, and we still want to try to check the clang version when reasonable):\n\nOptions:\n1. Only do the clang version check during the C compiler inference code (i.e. when `CC` was unset) and when `--enable-clang` was passed, or\n2. Have the clang version check be driven by the value of `CC` (be it inferred or explicitly provided) rather than by whether `--enable-clang` was passed.  E.g. perhaps if `CC` ends with `\"clang\"` (so that `\"ccache clang\"` would match) then do the version check.  If you pass some name for `CC` that does not match but is an alias for clang (e.g. a symlink or local build with a different name), then you don't get the configure-time check: its up to you to know what you're doing in that case.\n\nOption 1 is very conservative.  Option 2 seems better to me.  I think I will adopt Option 2.\n",
