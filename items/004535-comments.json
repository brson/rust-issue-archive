    "body": "I'm interested in iOS support , i had hoped you could generate C ofsorts via llvm but that doesn't work, so was looking at getting ASM source out of it.\nfor GL games, crossplatform c++ sourcebases can be called from platform specific stubs that interact with the os (objC for iOS, java/JNI/NDK for android) - I dont think you need necesarily rust to genereate standalone executables for it to be useful\n",
