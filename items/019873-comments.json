Using which in these cases, with or without a comma sounds totally wrong to me, but I may be biased, having grown up in a suburb of Chicago rather than a suburb of London.  \n\nAnyway, the American usage is consistent with the Brittish rules, so at least in this case, we can be consistent AND support both US and British English.
