What's happening here is that you have a pool of schedulers, let's say 8. The main task is on scheduler N, and spans the sub-task onto scheduler N. The main task is then immediately stolen to scheduler N+1. While the main tasks is being reawoken, the sub-task exits, caching its stack on scheduler _N_, not N+1. Hence, then the main task spawns another sub-task, the old stack is cached on a wrong scheduler. \n\nThis is kind of like a game of cat-and-mouse. When I ran the program with RUST_THREADS=8, there were 5668 stack cache misses (compared to the 100k tasks spawned). Whereas if I run with RUST_THREADS=1 there is only one stack miss.\n\nLots of these benchmarks are inherently single threaded (like this one), so go _appears_ to blow us away, but keep in mind that they're single-threaded by default and we're multi-threaded by default. We're also compounded with #11730 to make the situations even worse, sadly!\n\n---\n\ntl;dr - this is a dupe of #11730 unless we want to globally cache stacks instead of per-scheduler.\n",
