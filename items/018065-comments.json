    "body": "CString is not for static C strings, it's an RAII wrapper for `malloc`/`free` buffers with a terminating `\\0`. It's not part of the language so it isn't going to get literal sugar and should really just be removed from the standard libraries completely.\n\nI don't think using C strings should be encouraged because they're incapable of storing text (UTF-8 has inner NUL) and binary correctly so the use cases where they work are _very_ niche. We've already got the path case covered with `Path` and that's 99% of valid reasons to use C strings. Anything making use of them is always going to require `unsafe` code anyway so I don't see a problem with needing to use `\\0` when you're doing something that's ugly in the first place.\n\ncc @nick29581, this should be moved to the RFC repository\n",
