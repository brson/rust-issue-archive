But not sure what to do. This should be permitted.\n",

    "body": "The example compiles if I change `type` to `enum` in `type cat`, since then the typedef won't be substituted. I think it's bad that the original program infinite-loops, but I don't see an easy way out of it. To compute the type of the outer class `kitten` I need to know the types of each of its fields, and then to know the size of the `cat` field I need to know the type of `kitten`.\n",
