    "body": "I don't think that it's likely that we are going to have only one string type. Unique, boxed, and region pointers are a central part of Rust's memory model, so strings aren't going to be an exception to that. When someone doesn't care about performance, the thing to do is to use `@str` for everything.\n\nI don't see a concrete suggestion here that is likely to be implemented, so I'm closing this for now. I appreciate these issues, but we're likely to address them by improving the documentation rather than (at this point) changing the language.\n",
