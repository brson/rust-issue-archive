  "body": "I tried a couple of different ways to squash this, and still don't think this is ideal, but I wanted to get it out for feedback.\n\nCloses #5900\nCloses #9942\n\nThere are a few scenarios where the compiler tries to evaluate CastExprs without the corresponding types being available yet in the type context:  https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10618, https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/5900, https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9942\n\nThis PR takes the approach of having eval_const_expr_partial's CastExpr arm fall back to a limited ast_ty_to_ty call that only checks for (a subset of) valid const types, when the direct type lookup fails.  It's kind of hacky, so I understand if you don't want to take this as is.  I'd need a little mentoring to get this into better shape, as figuring out the proper fix has been a little daunting. I'm also happy if someone else wants to pick this up and run with it.\n\nThis closes 5900 and 9942, but only moves the goalposts a little on 10618, which now falls over in a later phase of the compiler.  \n",
