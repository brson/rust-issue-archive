I took the IR from #8484 (where extra glue was generated), and then manually added the calls to llvm.lifetime.{start,end} to the IR. The resulting optimized IR didn't have the glue removed, even though loads/stores were undefined to the location.\n\nThis may still help other optimization passes, but I'm not sure.\n",
