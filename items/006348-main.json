  "body": "In this commit I added a useful utility type, named Void, that encapsulates the\ndoable but annoying job of creating an uninhabited type. As well, a function on\nthat type, named absurd, was created which is useful for ignoring the result of\nmatching on that type. No unit tests were created because it is not possible to\ncreate an instance of this type to test the usage of.\n\nThis type is useful because it is like NonCopyable in that it can be used to\ncreate a type with special characteristics without special bloat. For instance,\ninstead of typing pub struct PhantomType { priv contents : () } for each void\ntype one may want to use one can simply type pub struct PhantomType (Void);.\nThis type make such special cases much easier to write.\n",
