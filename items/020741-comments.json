We've had [problems in the past](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/19797) with buggy pthreads implementations as well.\n\nThat being said, I'm not totally opposed to having a special case. It's a little unfortunate to start growing an array of `#[cfg]` directives that keep growing, but it is fairly isolated.\n\nOut of curiosity, do you know if this issue could be brought up with DragonFly maintainers?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton: The related DragonFly bug report is [here](http://bugs.dragonflybsd.org/issues/2763), but I doubt it will change, and even if it will be \"fixed\", there will always be older versions of DragonFly and Rust won't work on them. The way it is implemented in DragonFly protects you against duplicate `pthread_mutex_destroy()` calls, which IMHO is a good thing, except that it breaks the pthread spec which is saying that `PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER` should have the same effect as calling `pthread_mutex_init()`, which is not true on DragonFly. So I'd suggest to live with this `#[cfg]`-magic, hopefully it'll be the last required to get it working on DragonFly. One way to fix it in DragonFly would be to use a special sentinel value (e.g. a `(void*)1` pointer; `NULL` is used as initializer) which denotes that the mutex was destroyed.\n",
