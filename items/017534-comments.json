    "body": "This has been proposed multiple times before. It's always been considered too risky to have `Path` implement `Show`, because it's extremely common for people to assume file paths can be represented as strings, and therefore that producing a string from a `Path` will yield a value that accurately represents the path and can be used to re-create an identical `Path` object. However, this is not the case. This is why the `.display()` method exists, to make it really obvious that this is not an accurate representation.\n\nThe proper solution to `#[deriving(Show)]` is to provide the ability to customize the deriving. #14268 is related, though I believe there are other relevant issues as well.\n",
