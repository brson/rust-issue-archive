It sounds like this modification to the TIB is causing _something_ to fail when some initial library is loaded.\n\nAt this point, I think we need to figure out the minimal set of things that need to be done to \"get things loaded\". This minimal set of things can be done whenever libnative starts up, but I'm not sure what the minimal set of things are.\n\nThe minimal set of things includes \"boot libgreen and spawn a task\" because that's what using libgreen will do, but it would be nice to narrow it down more than that!\n\nDoes that make sense?\n",

    "body": "The behavior seems to suggest that it's not a good idea to modify `$fs:0x14` (or `$gs:0x28` on win64), which LLVM/Rust currently uses for segmented stack.\n\nfs:0x14 is known as \"ArbitraryUserPointer\", but [Raymond Chen said](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9261455/tib-custom-storage) that it's \"arbitrary\" for internals, not for application. (it's safe to believe what Raymond says!)\nI met the article before, but I also found conflicting claims (e.g. [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-dev/g_v27YGZM7o/uhIQg59I0W0J) and [this](https://codereview.appspot.com/5519054)) and at the time rust worked well, so I assumed it's ok in practice. Not we have to check if it really is :'( Here is C code reproducing the bad behavior:\n\n``` C\n#include <windows.h>\nint main() {\n    asm(\"movl $1234, %fs:0x14\");\n    MessageBoxA(0, \"abc\", \"abc\", 0);\n}\n```\n\nSo I want to investigate if LLVM can use TIB's stack bounds instead of ArbitraryUserPointer for segmented stack. We use them in `target_record_stack_bounds()` on win64 to record full available stack area, but if we call `target_record_stack_bounds(stack_lo + RED_ZONE, stack_hi)` then it can replace ArbitraryUserPointer usage.\n",

(Uh wait, the link says that `pvArbitrary` is theoretically safe to use!)\nSo it is not a good idea to use `StackLimit` with native stacks which libnative currently uses.\n\nBTW, the librand issue (`CryptAcquireContextA`) does not occur on win 8.1, but does occur on win 7.
