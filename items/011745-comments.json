    "body": "+1 on this topic from my side.\nI was also a little bit involved in the IRC dicussion yesterday after I had far more issues divding my code into multiple files and modules than in any other language I worked up to now.\n\nThe main thing that bothered me is the binding between files and modules -> each new file automatically generates a new module. When you try to divide your code into many files (e.g. one file per object as often done in C++/C#/others and even enforced in Java) you don't get files but even modules. With the additional modules you have to reimport everything and you can no longer access private fields/methods. That is often required when you have some objects that tightly interact. Imho that leads to either very large source code files or you begin to make much more things public than they should be.\n\nAs a backwards compatible improvement to this I could imagine the following:\n- Create a alternative import to mod xyz; that imports the content of the other file into the current module. In xyz you could then access all private members of other files that belong to the current module. If you don't like the C idea that each file's content can be arbitrarily included then you can use something like the Dart way: In the main file of the module you specify which other files belong to them by using `part \"otherfile.rs\"`. In all subfiles you specify to which module they belong by starting with `part of lib.rs` or even explicitely state the module name `part of foomodule;`. I like the first one better, because it has less ambiguity.\n\nThe incompatible way is to do it simply like C#, Java, AS3, ...:\n- In each file you start at the root module and describe absolutely into which module the following code should go. Multiple files can oben the same module and describe new types there. If you reference types of other modules, you either specify the path relative to the current module, use an absolute path or create an alias which imports the type into the current module. This approach requires you to think a little bit more about the complete module structure before implementation. But it is tried, proven and well understood by developers. I can also imagine that type resolution in such a  system is easier than what Rust currently does.\n\nBesides that I would think that crate local visibility for types would also help to overcome some of the visibility issues that creating new files->modules involves and would really like to see that feature.\n",

    "body": "A couple of points:\n1. Rust's module system is awesome. If we can make it more convenient to use, I'm all for it, but no semantic  changes please.\n2. Yes, the `mod`/`use` thing is weird. I believe it's just an implementation detail, the parser tries to resolve paths too early. I don't see a reason why that would need to stay that way forever.\n3. Haskell projects start 3-4 directories deep because of the Hackage global module namespace, with one extra file per directory for trivial re-exports. Is that something we should try to emulate? How about having to re-export everything and their dog in the module header?\n4. I'm not sure what you mean by \"which file you currently compile\". You compile a crate, not files. `foo.rs` is just `mod foo { ... }` factored out. `foo/bar.rs` is just `mod foo { mod bar {...} }`. They have _no meaning_ without the crate root. Granted, the docs don't really tell you and it's not obvious without forcing C++-like namespace declarations all over the place, but it _is_ a sane system*. This is also why Rust \"files\" can have mutually recursive dependencies while you have to [manually break them up](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Mutually_recursive_modules) in Haskell.\n\n*assuming you only declare `mod foo;` once, and `use` it everywhere else. It may or may not be a compiler bug to not check for that.\n",

    "body": "I'm not interested in a complete overhaul of the module system at this point. It's just too late in the game.\n\nWhat I _am_ interested in is making the current system slightly more restrictive than it currently is, in order to reduce the amount of complexity that a user has to keep in their head.\n\nI propose two restrictions:\n1. Forbid modules from having the same name as any of their ancestors. I've already proposed this as #11037. Our pathing rules (both module search paths and file search paths) are already complex enough without having to worry about which `foo` in `foo::foo::foo` your current local namespace is referencing.\n2. Forbid shadowing of imports. Make it just as much of an error as `fn foo(){} fn foo(){}` is today (`error: duplicate definition of value`). If I understand correctly, this behavior would allow us to remove the completely unintuitive use-before-mod rule, as bemoaned by others. And if forbidding shadowing makes globs harder to use, then so be it. Globs are an anti-pattern, and may very well be behind a feature flag for 1.0 anyway.\n",

    "body": "Coming from C#, the Rust module system did not work like I expected, but since Rust is not a verbose class oriented language like C#, the idea of modules becomes more important. I actually _like_ the way a module is located in a specific file by rigid rules. In C#, one has to rely on the IDE to find the declaration of an object. What makes Rust more complicated, is having to put 'mod' and 'use' at top of each file. This becomes a burden when the hierarchy is still in flux.\n\nMy idea is to add a new \"header\" like file named \"rust.rh\" per folder which one can declare the 'mod' and 'use' for the source files. All source files are compiled as if \"rust.rh\" is included directly at top of the source, but it can not contain code or declaration of new modules. No explicit declaration is necessary to use \"rust.rh\". This means getting started is easier, one can simply create a new empty document in an existing project and start typing. The compiler must ignore circular modules pointing to the same file and to do this it needs to strip \"rust.rh\" for the file it is processing. For future development the \"rust.rh\" file can contain instructions to flatten all the files in the folder, making them part of the same module. This will make source easier to manage per folder.\n\nMy wish is to not having to type 'mod' and 'use' at all per file.\n",

    "body": "I would also like to caution everyone again against proposing drastic, sweeping changes to the module system at this stage. This is a highly complex topic with far-reaching implications. We've been through a lot of iteration to arrive at our current system, and while it could be better it's also not nearly as bad as it used to be (who else remembers `export`? or `.rc` files?). Further iteration upon the current system is what we must strive for.\n\nRemember that there are only three hard problems in programming language design:\n1. Module systems\n2. Error handling\n3.

    "body": "> Importing functionality and namespace are two steps: mod and use. This leads to the shadowing rules, that have weird consequences: you need to import a path via use which is not even defined at this point in time, because use needs to before mod. I find this not only unfamiliar but also counterintuitive.\n\nYeah, we might be able to relax the ordering restrictions a bit.\n\n> The compiled file becomes a crate. In most languages you can iteratively compose a project of files/modules and use/compile those individually. Since use statements are relative to the crate, the meaning changes depending on which file you currently compile. The consequence is that it makes it more diffculta than necessary to first write file a.rs, then b.rs (uses a.rs), and then c.rs (uses b.rs) and make them compile individually. Even in Haskell that is easy. In Rust you either have to go back and forth and adjust the use-staments or only put the mod-statements in a dedicated top-level crate (lib.rs or main.rs) which defies encapsulation.\n\nCrates do not support mutual recursion. Modules do.\n\n> If you ask me, copy the Haskell module system. It's not great but it is a reasonably working subset of what Rust aims to provide.\n\nTotally opposed. Haskell modules do not support mutual recursion, which is a tremendous burden.\n",

The more I learn about how powerful the module systems are in SML and OCaml, the more I'm aware of how little I know about the language construct. [From the Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1vxdy5/rfc_improve_the_module_system/cewxhms):\n\n> when I think of a simple, powerful, and/or elegant module system, Haskell is certainly not what comes to mind. I think something more like SML's module system + SML/NJs compilation manager is a better ideal, although I like not having to write separate signature/interface files for Rust, and nesting modules in separate files is not really easily done in SML.\n> \n>  \u2013 @FluffySauce\n",

SML and OCaml have amazing module systems, but don't have type classes, Haskell has poor modules, but great type classes. What happens when you put them both in the same language? Are there any precedents for that?\n\nHere is a good page describing a bit about OCaml's modules: https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/first-class-modules.html\n\nI don't know if Rust needs that kind of power due to the fact we have type classes.

    "body": "> Maybe someone should first clarify what a module is. In the Ocaml book it looks more like Classes in C++ with some encapsulated definitions to me than something like packages or namespaces, but I have no clue about ML.\n\nYes, that is an issue. Perhaps the OP is indeed thinking of modules as more of 'namespaces' which are more for organizing large sets of items into manageable, self-documenting chunks, rather than the powerful language features displayed in languages like SML that are designed to help enable the modularization of code. We need some clarification on terminology here otherwise we will be talking past each other.\n\nIf I recall correctly @nikomatsakis and I have talked about type paremeterisation of modules. It could allow for some powerful patterns, but I think there were issues with it making things like resolve much more complex, and it might also overlap some of the functionality of traits (see the papers I posted above).\n",

    "body": "This is some of the latest module related research that I know of:\n\n\"ML modules provide hierarchical namespace management, as well as fine-grained control over the propagation of type information, but they do not allow modules to be broken up into mutually recursive, separately compilable components. Mixin modules facilitate recursive linking of separately compiled components, but they are not hierarchically composable and typically do not support type abstraction. We synthesize the complementary advantages of these two mechanisms in a novel module system design we call MixML. \"\nhttp://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/mixml/\n\nand haskells take on MixML:\n\n\" Module systems like that of Haskell permit only a weak form of modularity in which module implementations directly depend on other implementations and must be processed in dependency order. Module systems like that of ML, on the other hand, permit a stronger form of modularity in which explicit interfaces express assumptions about dependencies, and each module can be typechecked and reasoned about independently.\n\nIn this paper, we present Backpack, a new language for building separately-typecheckable packages on top of a weak module system like Haskell's. The design of Backpack is inspired by the MixML module calculus of Rossberg and Dreyer, but differs significantly in detail. Like MixML, Backpack supports explicit interfaces and recursive linking. Unlike MixML, Backpack supports a more flexible applicative semantics of instantiation. Moreover, its design is motivated less by foundational concerns and more by the practical concern of integration into Haskell, which has led us to advocate simplicity\u2014in both the syntax and semantics of Backpack\u2014over raw expressive power. \"\nhttp://plv.mpi-sws.org/backpack/\n\nThis still seems to be of research status but might give inspiration. At least it is the state of the art AFAIK.\n",

    "body": "my 2c.... to me the rust module system is surprisingly counter-intuitive, having not used anything similar; \n\nBut could you simply educate users through more elaborate error messages: when you try to reference something that doesn't exist, the compiler could look in places that correspond to common errors users make .. and suggest corrective action (\"did you mean ::foo::bar()\" or \"add 'use foo::bar' to make bar visible\")\n\nI would have guessed something more like haskells' would be easier to get into but I gather there are good reasons not to do it that way. (\"use mod ....\"   \"use mod .... as <shortcut>\" .. and just keep a graph of modules..)\n\nI usually end up making a \"common.rs\" with a load of use's and just use common::\\* all over the place;  as mentioned above it makes life easier when a system is in flux. Seems like one can avoid making a seperate source for that by saying \"use super::*\", not sure if thats a good or bad idea\n\nAt the minute i'm basically shying away from heavily using the module system because of the lack of an IDE; i still try to make symbol names unambiguous across my (so far, small) projects. With polymorphism going on you shouldn't need so many symbols. Having said that, in C++ i use nested classes alot, and even C++ people say \"avoid that, make a namespace..\" ... so I am begining to see the rationale behind the rust method.\n",

    "body": "I started writing multi-file Rust today, and I think the way it currently works is completely counterintuitive to newcomers. Documentation is no substitute for sane defaults.\n\nIf something doesn't change, I believe you'll end up with include!() as the preferred way of managing modules.\n\n# Proposal for Unsurprising Modules\n\n## Summary\n- `mod foo;` goes in every file that wants to access the stuff in foo.rs\n- `mod deeper::bar;` goes in every file that wants to access the stuff in deeper/foo.rs\n- `use foo;` is meaningless (but to avoid breaking old code, would continue with the current meaning)\n- `use foo::frob` to avoid typing `foo::frob();` (this is what people expect of `use`, i.e. something that may be quite rare depending on your programming style)\n\n## Source layout\n- src/main.rs\n  `mod fish;`\n  `mod penguin;`\n- src/fish.rs\n  `mod penguin;`\n  `mod penguin::bar;`\n- src/penguin/\n  - src/penguin/mod.rs\n    `mod foo;`\n    `mod bar;`\n    `use foo::popular_function;`\n  - src/penguin/foo.rs\n    `mod bar;`\n  - src/penguin/bar.rs\n\nNow step back and look at that source layout again. I bet you understood _exactly_ how my proposed modules work without having to read any documentation.\n\n## In Detail\n- At all times, when the compiler is parsing code from in a directory, there is a \"current root\" referring to that directory. For `main.rs`, it is `::`; for `penguin/mod.rs` it is `::penguin`.\n- When the compiler sees `mod foo;`, it:\n  - If foo has never been read from this directory, arrange to read it from either `foo.rs` or `foo/mod.rs` and add a reference to it in the current directory root module\n  - You could add `foo.rs` to \"list of files to read sometime after I'm done with this one\"\n  - Better, read foo.rs immediately and just return immediately if you're already in that module. If you add the module object to its parent's symbol table before filling its content, this does not need any additional logic.\n  - Act like a current `use foo;` referring to the module added.\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n- As long as you don't have two modules in the same directory with the same name, this should be fully backward compatible, since the implicit and explicit `use`s will put the mods in the same place\n- If you _do_ have two modules in the same directory with the same name, your code is unethical, and the community is better off by breaking it.\n\n## Open Questions\n- Anything dealing with multiple crates.\n- Exactly how should the root module (the one passed to rustc) be special? Should it continue like it is, or should it and rustc does the equivalent of `use rootmodule::main;` (Python has problems with this)\n- Is it really necessary for `penguin.rs` or `penguin/mod.rs` to exist? Instead just `mod penguin::foo;` could imply it?\n- if `penguin/qux.rs` exists but is not mentioned in `penguin/mod.rs`, should it be possible to refer directly to it from outside of `penguin/` ? Currently it's not, but if the import is pub, it could be `::penguin::foo::qux`\n- Should nesting modules in one file (`mod foo { }`) be feature-gated?\n- Should there be an intermediate level of privacy for sibling modules?\n- Should there be a syntax for relative imports from a higher package (like python `from .. import foo`)? (Only really useful with deep package hierarchies)\n",

    "body": "Here is one proposal:\n\nAt the moment all imports come from the root of the crate by default in order to remove ambiguities when resolving paths. How about making working relative to the current module the default?\n\nSay we have a crate set up like:\n\n``` rust\nmod baz {\n    mod foo {\n        fn bar() {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's say we are working within the `baz` module:\n- `use foo::bar;` and `foo::bar()` would access the item relative to the current module.\n- `use ::baz::foo::bar` and `::baz::foo::bar()` would access an item relative to the root module of the crate.\n- `use super::baz::foo::bar;` and `super::baz::foo::bar()` would access an item from a higher module relative to the current module.\n\nThis might make things less surprising \u2013 I still get tripped up by having to use `self::` for working relative to the current crate. The disadvantage of this is that it might make 'the common case' more ugly. So I'm not sure. Food for thought anyway.\n",

    "body": "@o11c - i'm the same in that every time i pick it up after a break, what it does is completely surprising;\nBut I think it can be fixed with smaller changes, less disruptive to rust progress..\n\n[1] Educating in error messages:-\n\n[1.1] When you expected to be able to reference a symbol and its in the wrong place, the compiler looks for the closest match, and tells you what the correct path was. You just need to be reminded of the fact 'use' is crate relative, and code is mod relative. This automatic search would also be hugely useful in this early time without an IDE.\n\n[1.2] When you started out saying \"mod foo..\" where you want foo like I always did, the compiler can warn you.. \"warning, multiple copies of mod foo, prefer to bring modules in the crate root and 'use' them elsewhere\".\n\n[3] fixing the glob import bugs (currently use super::*) doesn't work. I've been adding a 'common.rs' , and if i could just opt to carry common 'pub uses' declared in the crate root that would streamline it.\n(Adding the ability to \"use ::*\" would make that easier too?). That would eliminate the need for 'common.rs'.\n\nI'm happy with the logic of how the system actually works ... its a combination of namespacing and modules... i've not used that much in C++ voluntarily because you've got the alternative of classes-in-classes, and its an extra layer. The Rust way gives more meaning to the directory tree.\n\nThere's one more change I would suggest, I suspect it won't be popular.\nmake _pub_ the default. Every file needs public elements, but private is the optional one. Rust has good namespacing to hide symbols - so to me it makes sense to make everything 'pub' and then you hide with 'priv' where you need more control..(IMO)\n",

    "body": "The biggest pain IMO is splitting a module across multiple files. Right now you need reexports or `include!`, the first being verbose and error-prone (without glob reexports) and the second being a hack, or just deal with introducing unnecessarily deep/wide heirarchies. Phrased another way, we currently have a way to write mods independant of files `mod foo { contents }`, but not a way to write files independant of mods.\n\nAnother minor pain is that I frequently find myself saying `use std; use gl; use glfw;` etc etc etc in submodules. It'd be nice if there was some sort of use that got \"inherited\" by submodules, so that, for example `inherit use gl;` makes `gl` available to all submodules. This would also make the prelude a bit less magical; it could simple be `inherit use std::prelude::*;` in the crate root, rather than being injected into every module. I don't think this syntax is very good, but I think the semantics are _very nice_. (I think it might even be able to be a syntax extension, albiet one that transforms the entire AST starting at the module it is invoked in. Assuming they have that information.)\n",

Last year, I had learned about the complexity of \u201cmod\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d. This year, in order to avoid having too many confusions and limitations with the use of \u201cmod\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d, I will put all structs and functions into main.rs. If I implement multiple files, the project code pattern must allocate code in a tree structure - one way direction down to the tree branch to call functions/structs. I have tested it and it does not support cross-call functions/structs from different files similar to Go and C#. I strongly suggest Rust to implment Go style of Package naming. It allows a very flexible of function/struct call as-if a single file. This improvement can attact expansion of user base significantly. Or recommend Visual Studio Code editor, allow users to define different blocks of a single file, let it view as-if multiple files.",
