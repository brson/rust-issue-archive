    "body": "I don't think an \"atomic copy\" is a thing? Since all the atomic operations essentially just work on the `self` pointer, copying an atomic type results in an entire new value, in a new memory location. I'm pretty sure that an \"atomic copy\" is impossible since it requires a read and then store to 2 separate memory locations. The only thing I can think of is the lack of an atomic load.\n\nI'm also not sure that being implicitly copyable is an issue, other the above point, and would prefer to keep this way to be honest. There is no semantic difference between using the `Atomic*` types and the methods on them and using the atomic intrinsics directly pointers to the values you want to manipulate. The only real advantage of the atomic types is a nicer API. The way it currently is means that the atomic types are identical (except for `AtomicBool`) to their non-atomic counterparts.\n",
