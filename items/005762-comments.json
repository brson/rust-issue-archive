From a recent IRC conversation with @Sodel-the-Vociferous:\n\n```\n[17:26:42] <nmatsakis> anyway, so yeah, the idea would be to (1) add a new kind of adjustment for objects\n[17:26:54] <nmatsakis> (2) modify code-generation (what we call `trans`) to deal with that\n[17:27:10] <nmatsakis> (3) modify the method code to borrow in search_for_autosliced_method()\n[17:27:24] <nmatsakis> and (4) modify the method code to handle the @self etc coercions\n[17:27:34] <nmatsakis> if that all works out, then the end result is that whenever we call a method that expects &self\n```\n\nA simple test case (which works today, but not via the intended paths) would be:\n\n```\ntrait MyTrait {\n    fn get_by_ref(&self) -> uint;\n}\n\nstruct MyStruct {\n    f: uint\n}\n\nimpl MyTrait for MyStruct {\n    fn get_by_ref(&self) -> uint {\n        self.f\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let s: @MyTrait = (@MyStruct {f: 22}) as @MyTrait;\n    assert!(s.get_by_ref() == 22);\n}\n```\n",

From the look of those commits, this could be more involved than I had hoped.\n\nWould it be worthwhile to get that patch set working with the latest `incoming`, and building atop that? Though, as I'm still getting acquainted with the compiler's innards, that task seems a bit daunting.\n\nAlso, note that my above commits have borked something in compile-time checking of objects' methods. I'll try to set aside some time to debug that sometime in the next few days.\n",

    "body": "Status update: I got a version of this building, bsaed on Sodel-the-V's branch, but encountered a problem with how method lookup is defined. I embarked to rewrite method lookup to fix this problem but haven't finished that work. The problem is a quesiton of how we prioritize methods: I believe we have to prioritize inherent methods over trait methods. Bonus is that I would expect this to improve compilation time.\n",
