I don't mind if we keep using `args[0]` for the name, (since its targetting, as I said, human readers).  But it would be nice if we kept it restricted to one line.\n\n`--version=verbose` (or something along those lines) should produce the same first line as `--version`, followed by a series of key-value pairs along the lines suggested by @anemator. All of the info in the first line should be derivable via output included in the series of key-value pairs.  I.e. I want the first line to be 100% redundant, deliberately.\n\nThen scripts can interact with the output produced by `--version=verbose` (by dropping the first line), while humans get to look at whichever they like.\n",
