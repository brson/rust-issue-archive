    "body": "I think this is intended. Because items are destroyed in the opposite order that they are created when they go out of scope, the `DropCanary` must live strictly longer than the `Handle`, or otherwise the `Handle` destructor could see a dropped canary :)\n\nEdit: If you put them on the same line, e.g.:\n\n``` rust\nlet (mut handle, long_enough_lifetime) = (Handle(None), DropCanary{label:\"long\"});\n```\n\nit also works. I'm not sure if this is correct because I'm not aware of the order in which they are dropped in this case.\n",
