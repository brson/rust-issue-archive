  "body": "This does a number of things, but especially dramatically reduce the\nnumber of allocations performed for operations involving attributes/\nmeta items:\n- Converts ast::meta_item & ast::attribute and other associated enums\n  to CamelCase.\n- Converts several standalone functions in syntax::attr into methods,\n  defined on two traits AttrMetaMethods & AttributeMethods. The former\n  is common to both MetaItem and Attribute since the latter is a thin\n  wrapper around the former.\n- Deletes functions that are unnecessary due to iterators.\n- Converts other standalone functions to use iterators and the generic\n  AttrMetaMethods rather than allocating a lot of new vectors (e.g. the\n  old code would have to allocate a new vector to use functions that\n  operated on &[meta_item] on &[attribute].)\n- Moves the core algorithm of the #[cfg] matching to syntax::attr,\n  similar to find_inline_attr and find_linkage_metas.\n\nThis doesn't have much of an effect on the speed of #[cfg] stripping,\ndespite hugely reducing the number of allocations performed; presumably\nmost of the time is spent in the ast folder rather than doing attribute\nchecks.\n\nAlso fixes the Eq instance of MetaItem_ to correctly ignore spans, so\nthat `rustc --cfg 'foo(bar)'` now works.\n",
