  "body": "This partially implements the feature staging described in the\n[release channel RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0507-release-channels.md). It does not yet fully conform to the RFC as\nwritten, but does accomplish its goals sufficiently for the 1.0 alpha\nrelease.\n\nIt has three primary user-visible effects:\n- On the nightly channel, use of unstable APIs generates a warning.\n- On the beta channel, use of unstable APIs generates a warning.\n- On the beta channel, use of feature gates generates a warning.\n\nCode that does not trigger these warnings is considered 'stable',\nmodulo pre-1.0 bugs.\n\nDisabling the warnings for unstable APIs continues to be done in the\nexisting (i.e. old) style, via `#[allow(...)]`, not that specified in\nthe RFC. I deem this marginally acceptable since any code that must do\nthis is not using the stable dialect of Rust.\n\nUse of feature gates is itself gated with the new 'unstable_features'\nlint, on nightly set to 'allow', and on beta 'warn'.\n\nThe attribute scheme used here corresponds to an older version of the\nRFC, with the `#[staged_api]` crate attribute toggling the staging\nbehavior of the stability attributes, but the user impact is only\nin-tree so I'm not concerned about having to make design changes later\n(and I may ultimately prefer the scheme here after all, with the\n`#[staged_api]` crate attribute).\n\nSince the Rust codebase itself makes use of unstable features the\ncompiler and build system do a midly elaborate dance to allow it to\nbootstrap while disobeying these lints (which would otherwise be\nerrors because Rust builds with `-D warnings`).\n\nThis patch includes one significant hack that causes a\nregression. Because the `format_args!` macro emits calls to unstable\nAPIs it would trigger the lint.  I added a hack to the lint to make it\nnot trigger, but this in turn causes arguments to `println!` not to be\nchecked for feature gates. I don't presently understand macro\nexpansion well enough to fix. This is bug #20661.\n\nCloses #16678\n\nNext steps are to disable the existing out-of-tree behavior for stability attributes, and convert the remaining system to be feature-based per the RFC. During the first beta cycle we will set these lints to 'forbid'.\n",
