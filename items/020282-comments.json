    "body": "Thanks for the pull request, and welcome! The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Looking through the wiki git history, `Note-build-system.md` was removed on 2014-06-19 in wiki commit d91b9956d8dde1a883c2dcc5dba168efb82ae3ef -- it was a big cleanup of allegedly obsolete pages.  The page itself contained pretty much what is now documented in `Makefile.in` itself, i.e. a list of build targets.\n\nThere's a link on the \"getting started\" page to \"build system notes\", which used to point to the now-removed wiki page, and since 2014-06-28 (wiki commit b9139fba12767cdcacd147a11f4265e22f59ece2) that link points to `Makefile.in` line 11.\n\nOf all wiki pages, the getting-started guide seems the most useful to link to from the Makefile, but I'll happily tweak if there are any better ideas :-)\n",
