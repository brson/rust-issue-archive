The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

The explanation given: \n- `curl URL | sh` is bad: \n  - Because HTTP is dangerous\n  - Because HTTPS is dangerous but less than HTTP\n\nTherefore:\n- Never run programs downloaded via `curl` or `wget`\n- Don't pipe to shell\n\nWhere did that second corollary come from? Most of the links listed are like that but the http://www.seancassidy.me/dont-pipe-to-your-shell.html actually discussed the issue with piping. It seemed to be the only one relevant...\n",
