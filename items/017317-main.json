  "body": "This marks the slow path in the `Vec<T>` `push` function, improviding\ncode generation by moving it out of fast paths. The `push` function is\ninlined in countless locations and not all of them order these blocks\nappropriately without a hint. This improves the performance of the\nmicrobenchmark in #15177 by 15% when dirty page purging is disabled.\n\nExposing the i1 version of the intrinsic for `bool` would be useful, but\nthe quirks of Rust's code generation prevent it from becoming branch\nmetadata so it has been left out for now.\n\nA more sophisticated approach could be taken in the future (#11092) but\nthis provides a useful optimization feature today.\n",
