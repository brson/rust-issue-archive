I'll admit that originally I copied this logic from glibc's implementation without fully understanding it, but I've now taken a closer look at the Two-Way paper and understand what it does. It's essentially implementing the `small-period` function that can be found on p. 670 of the paper. I've updated the comments to explain what's going on here. I'm at least somewhat confident that this is correct.\n",
