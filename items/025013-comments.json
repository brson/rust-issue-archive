    "body": "Speaking of overflowing in slice, I think we still have other overflow possibilities. It appears as though slice was written to work properly in the case of zero-sized slices where `s.as_ptr() + s.len()` wrapped around (specifically, it doesn't seem to rely in the iterators that `end > ptr`, and it explicitly handles the case of wrapping around during iteration by always yielding `&mut *(1 as *mut _)` as the iterator value for zero-sized elements (because yielding null would be interpreted as `None` instead of as `Some(_)`). But all this code was written with wrapping arithmetic in mind. So there's code that does things like `ptr as usize + len()`, which might trigger an overflow check.\n\nI'll file a ticket about it. (**Update:** Filed as #25016)\n",
