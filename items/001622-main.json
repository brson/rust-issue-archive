  "body": "We don't want users to hurt themselves, since the installer has a bug in 0.1 that could possibly corrupt `%PATH%`.\n\nThis should certainly be reverted once the installer is fixed and a new release is about to be made.\n\nPersonally I feel the tutorial should be re-generated with this change and uploaded to www.rust-lang.org ASAP in order to stop users from hurting themselves. The homepage is fixed but this lingering bit still remains.\n",
