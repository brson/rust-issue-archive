    "body": "I also ran into this recently. Thinking about it a little, it seems you could go about this more than one way. Does `()` as your error type mean that an error can't happen (which makes sense to me) or that you don't care about the error type (not what I would like to see in code, but something I imagine many would be tempted to use)?\n\nDeciding on the semantics of `impl Error for ()` will inform the impl details. If `()` means \"can't fail\", then it's reasonable to invoke `panic!` or `unreachable!`. Any thoughts about where to take this?\n",
