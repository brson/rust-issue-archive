  "body": "This pull request changes `#[inline(always)]` to `#[inline(force)]`. The old version now emits a warning, but still maintains the `always_inline` behaviour.\n\nThe libraries all have been changed, so no warning there. I also de-forced a lot of functions/methods, though none have had the `inline` attribute removed completely. I also added `#[inline]` to several functions that seemed like good candidates.\n\nI haven't checked to see if this changes the compilation time, I don't think it will.\n",
