It doesn't match the syntax in `src/test/run-pass/constrained-type.rs` or in the commented-out parts of `src/lib/util.rs`.\n\nIt looks like the file had the correct syntax when it was first added in bd4aeef78bcc8e03ef9275e7652f91b936f5dec6 but it got mangled by the pretty-printer in df7f21db093b0f206048b18e977161f91b7c28f1.  Then 6e2a7bff7faf040b1eced0ee3547b28f6962cedc fixed some of the pretty-printer damage but not all; it looks like it missed some of the damage in this file (but fixed similar damage in `src/test/run-pass/constrained-type.rs`).  Revision cc2ebbec92230fa3e377550e42cab4d964bb866d fixed the pretty-printer, but it came too late to prevent the damage to this file.\n\n(I know this doesn't really matter since the feature doesn't work, but I'm just starting to look through the Rust code and this was one bit that I noticed was wrong.)\n",
