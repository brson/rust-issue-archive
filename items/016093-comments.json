    "body": "Something to plan for, but not implement this pass, is creating a `#[cfg(target_libc = \"\")]`. `liblibc` uses the `target_os` to work out which libc to use. Linux is glibc, Windows is msvcrt, android is Bionic, Mac/BSD is BSD libc, many other platforms are moving to newlib. Changing `liblibc` to be thinking about the libc instead of the OS might/should make porting easier (as you'd probably be using an existing libc).\n",
