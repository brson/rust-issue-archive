    "body": "I believe that this is intentional because the type `*mut T` isn't really \"owned\" by any crate, and in this case the crate neither owns `Default` nor `*mut T`, so even though `Foo` is owned it doesn't pass the coherence rules. That being said I think it'd be fine to add `Default` implementations for pointers in the standard library :)\n",
