    "body": "@glaebhoerl I suspect @pcwalton knows better here, but I am not sure there are many technical problems, assuming e.g. that each `use` is resolved relative solely to the `use` decls that precede it (i.e. later ones are not in scope), and assuming that once you make `use` decls use relative resolution, that absolute lookups would be written with a leading `::`.  That last detail sounds like it would resolve the top-level `bar` example you provided.  (Presumably the prelude would include a `use ::std` so that all the existing `use std::foo::bar` would continue to work.)\n\nThe bigger issue is whether we would want to go down the road of relative lookup in `use` decls.  E.g. I am not eager to have to scan through all of the preceding `use` decls in order to interpret the one I am currently looking at.  And it is likewise nice that I can easily cut-and-paste `use` decls into other contexts within a crate.  But maybe these are minor issues that I could solve independently (or just use leading `::` throughout the `use` decls in my own code...)\n",

    "body": "One reason -- which is not technical -- is that it was _really_ hard\nto tell what was going on in the \"old days\", when imports could be\nrelative. There were various instances of people not being able to\ntell where an import was coming from.\n\nThat said, I don't have a clear understanding of what the limits\nare. I believe the current system still suffers from some ambiguous or\nbizarre situations and I don't know that removing relative `use`\nstatements made any such situations \"go away\" entirely (though it may\nhave). I vaguely recall though that it was possible to rewrite at\nleast some of the bad examples in the current syntax.\n",

    "body": "After discussion at meeting, decided that none of the alternatives here are all that attractive.  (Though I was intrigued by @nikomatsakis 's proposal of \"try relative, then fall back on absolute\" for resolution in non-`use` contexts, which is like what Java and others do.)\n\nAnyway, closing; we should instead put in better compiler diagnostics (e.g. checking if abs/rel would work instead on error, and then presenting an error message explaining this language detail) to help new users get over this initial speed-bump.\n",
