Hot-swapping is indeed tricky, though some of the things necessary to support it (e.g. marking pages as executable; I-cache flushing, etc) would also be necessary to support a JIT compiler.\n\nI suspect we'd also need position-independent code (PIC).  The Kitsune paper actually covers even more aggressive transformations, e.g. migrating the data layouts between versions.  (I have only skimmed that paper at this point.)\n",
