They're totally necessary in some cases, and are shorter than type annotations.\n\nMaybe it's just a question of the limit of what we consider \"lint\", but ISTM this path leads to a lint mode for every possible AST construct, and each lint pass _does_ take a (small) amount of time to walk the AST of every function. They're not fused.\n\nIn any case, I don't feel this should block \"production ready\"\n",
