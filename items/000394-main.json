  "body": "Good morning. These two patches fix some problems I was having with the build system:\n- if it finds an llvm-config inside `CFG_LLVM_ROOT`, it will use it to determine the cxxflags and ldflags. This was needed to get macros like `__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS` defined properly. If it doesn't find one, it falls back to the old behavior for windows.\n- It errors the configuration if it finds an old clang (<3.0svn). Rust currently depends on an unreleased clang fix for flexible arrays that's used in `src/rt/rust_builtins.cpp`. It's possible that instead of erroring out the build system should just fall back onto gcc. Would that be better?\n",
