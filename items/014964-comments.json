    "body": "We're starting to build up a huge amount of stylistic lints, and it's sad to see ~20 allows for this lint just applied throughout the codebase. I'm getting more and more hesitant to just keep adding lints which are getting annoying to both read all over the place and remember to ignore. I agree that this is the \"rust style\" and it's nice to have some enforcement, but we need to control the explosion of tiny lints with long names.\n\nThis was [discussed recently](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2014-06-10#stylistic-lints), but we ran out of time before reaching any conclusion.\n",
