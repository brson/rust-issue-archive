    "body": "Now that #8631 has landed (awesome work!) I've rebased on top of that and implemented all pipe I/O, and process manipulation through that interface.\n\nI also refactored everything to mirror more closely what I realized the design was between rtio/uvio, and I think that it actually looks really nice now. The only unfortunate part is that the `run` module reaches all the way down into the `uv::process` module to build the configuration for it, but I don't think that it's too egregious.\n\nI'm still running `make check` locally, but it passed my previously failing test which was smaller, so I think that this is ready to go!\n\nr? @brson\n",

Right now we'd have to wait for a fix of https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/887 to get merged into master to be able to use tip. Beyond that though, there's not really anything extra that we have any more.\n\nIt also turns out that their `Makefile.mingw` is a super-simple bare-bones type makefile. It doesn't look like it'd be too hard to even bundle directly for ourselves. It is worrisome that they're not very interested in mingw, but they also seem amenable to suggestions!\n",

    "body": "@olsonjeffery and I talked a bit on IRC about this, but there were two reasons why this was reverted.\n1. There was a massive regression in the testing time of windows, which I never fully investigated or figured out what was the source.\n2. This change was the foremost suspect of causing a lot of segfaults on the bots during testing (main reason it was reverted).\n\nAlso, as @vadimcn there were also a lot of issues with building libuv, although none of them were really revert-worthy. More of an indication that my next attempt should try to fix a bunch of them before going through.\n\nAs for the steps forward, I could never reproduce the segfaults locally to debug them, so I intend on attempting to re-land this in a few steps.\n1. Upgrade libuv without process bindings at all.\n2. Implement process bindings, but don't use them except in tests.\n3. Use the new process bindings in `std::run`\n",
