    "body": "This is still a little in-flux as it's not passing `make check`. Most of the trouble seems to come down to blocking vs non-blocking stdio. When we use the TTY handles from libuv, it sets the file descriptors in non-blocking mode, but then when we making blocking calls with `io::native` it returns an error `EAGAIN`. This is pretty normal, but right now there's no condition handler registered which ends up in all sorts of disaster.\n\nThere are only 2 users of `native::stdio` which are logging and `dumb_println`. I'm moving logging to uv stdio (or whatever the local event loop provides), and then I'm modifying `dumb_println` to handle `EAGAIN`, although this shouldn't be called that often (only `rterrln!` and `rtabort!` use it currently, and maybe `rtdebug!`).\n\nI've also finished migrating everything to a trait object instead of using typedefs.\n\nI'll update this once I have everything passing `make check`\n",

We're forced to make stdin async, however, but I think that it's less of a problem.\n\nThat is an interesting concern though. I doubt any c library would panic or anything (who checks the return value of printf?), but it would mean that some prints could possibly get lost. This doesn't happen 100% of the time (only when another write is currently in-flight I believe), so it's not like it would invalidate all FFI printfs, but it probably wouldn't be great either.\n",
