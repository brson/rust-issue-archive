    "body": "> At very least, if you don't want to support saturating mul/div, surely your reasoning implies that Saturate should be broken into two Traits?\n\n`Saturating` literally only exists to make `Iterator.size_hint()` easier to implement. That's why it's a single trait, and that's why it takes the argument by-value instead of by-reference. It was designed purely for convenience, and is not really expected to be used anywhere else.\n\nIf you have a use-case for `Saturating` outside of `size_hint()`, then it might make sense to promote it from \"convenience trait\" to a fully-fledged numeric trait. But without a real use-case I think it's unnecessary work.\n\nFor the record, I'm not sure `saturating_div` even makes sense to provide. What is it going to saturate? Our \"checked\" traits are only implemented on integral types. The only two cases I can think of where you even need _checked_ division are when either a) you might be dividing `MIN` by `-1`, or b) you might be dividing by 0. And neither case really makes much sense in the context of a saturating operation.\n",
