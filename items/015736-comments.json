    "body": "While attempting an implementation of such a lint, I encountered a problem: `cfg!` macros are often used in `if` conditions, and a lint would be triggered by a chain like:\n\n``` rust\nif cfg!(target_os = \"windows\") { ... }\nelse if cfg!(target_os = \"macos\") { ... }\nelse if cfg!(target_os = \"linux\") { ... }\n```\n\nbecause at compile-time, at least two of the `cfg!`s would expand to `false`. Should this lint just ignore bare `true`s and `false`s (because presumably you know what you\u2019re doing), or should such places manually disable the lint?\n\nAlso, this lint discovered what may be a bug in std: [over here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/rt/backtrace.rs#L133), `$RP$` presumably stands for \u2018raw pointer\u2019, but [a few lines later](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/rt/backtrace.rs#L138) it\u2019s used to mean \u2018right parenthesis\u2019. Assuming this is a bug, this really does show the use of such a lint.\n",
