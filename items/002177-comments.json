    "body": "One other, related, thing: right now, we always inline generic functions.  I think the original plan was to having generic functions only be inlined if they were tagged `#[inline]`.  In the event that you made a cross-crate call to non-inlined generic function, the call would only be permitted the generic types were bound to box types (or something like that).  Then, for all exported generic functions, we would make sure to export a version that operates on box types.\n",
