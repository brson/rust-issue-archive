    "body": "@Kimundi they are not equivalent and `*()` is correct. `Void` is the type that can't be constructed, and if an instance of it ever exists, it means the type system is unsound (if using safe code) or has been subverted (if using unsafe code). If you have a pointer-to-`Void` it implies that there's an instance of `Void` that it's pointing to, and you can call `.uninhabited()` on it and cause whatever havoc. The raw pointer half of it means that it requires `unsafe` code either way, so it's not as bad as it could be, but anyway, it's not the right idea.\n\n(`void` in C-like languages is not the type-theoretical `Void`, it's actually equivalent to `()`. To avoid this confusion I was wanting to rename our `Void` to something like `Never`, but removing it is fine too.)\n",

That being said, the compiler does no such analysis to realize that `foo()` cannot return in the second case, and that's supposed to be appeased with `foo.uninhabited()` (I think?).\n\nWe want to remove the `std::util` module, and I don't think that `Void` really has a place in the standard library (but I could be wrong)\n",
