    "body": "I was searching how Rust debugging can be done in VS Code and found the [C++ extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/tree/master/Extension) supports debugging via MSVC. The C++ extension uses the [debug adapter protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/). Looking at the source code and [package.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/blob/master/Extension/package.json) file, it looks like the DAP server is downloaded [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872985). But reading the `license.txt` file inside the zip file it is unclear to me if these binaries are allowed to be used by other tools than the VS Code extension and Visual Studio itself.\r\nSo it doesn't seem clear if there is a good alternative to GDB on Windows for other tools than VS Code and Visual Studio.",
