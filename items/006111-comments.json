My local `make check` runs are not encountering any of these; but they do terminate unsuccessfully due to \n\n```\nfailures:\n    [run-pass] /Users/fklock/Dev/Mozilla/rust.git/src/test/run-pass/too-much-recursion.rs\n```\n\nI don't want to keep asking bors to do this for me, but `make check` is not showing me these problems locally.   I have some ideas for work-arounds to try to iterate through the testing space locally, but I am clueless as to what to do about the heart of the problem (i.e. that my `make check` run is not a faithful representative of bor's `make check` run).\n",
