    "body": "This unfortunately broke some of my code. I used the fact that I could implement `ToStr` by using the impure `io::with_str_writer` with a `to_writer(wr: io::Writer)` to make my `~str`s.\n\nI think we could also make `io::with_str_writer` pure, but we'd have to use `unsafe` blocks, at least until #3722 is implemented. Is that too much cheating?\n",
