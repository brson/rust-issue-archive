In order to change colors one must use console API functions, such as [SetConsoleTextAttribute](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686047%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).   Unfortunately these require console handle, but there no obvious way to extract a file handle from io::Writer.

So this patch tries to figure out if it is run from a msys terminal (env var TERM is cygwin, since msys is a modified fork of an older cygwin version) and then enables colors.\n\nHere is a screenshot of my patch in action: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mi7gxp94ilkis60/Screenshot%202013-12-17%2008.39.48.png\n\nStrangely this also works with cmd.exe on my system. Maybe because I have msysgit installed? I don't know how to detect this though: https://www.dropbox.com/s/tvk5hd3n8ur4cnd/Screenshot%202013-12-17%2008.42.09.png\n\nSorry if there are issues in my patch, I'm very new to Rust and unfamiliar with the language.\n",

    "body": "Okay my patch has been merged, here are some of the things I found out, if anyone wants to work on cmd.exe/cygwin support:\n- cmd.exe / PowerShell: isatty == 0, TERM is not set. Supports ansi colors though (maybe cause of msysgit?)\n- cygwin: isatty == 0, TERM is set to \"xterm\" and terminfo is supported.\n- msys: isatty == 64, TERM is set to \"cygwin\" and terminfo is not supported.\n\nColored output in cygwin doesn't work because of this check: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/diagnostic.rs#L205\n\nSide note: I just opened up this awesome PowerShell: An ugly looking window came up with non anti-aliased text and no colors at all. I can't even resize it properly - LOL. Microsoft == failure.\n\nMy advice for anyone: Use ConEmu with msys ;)\n",
