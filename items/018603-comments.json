    "body": "@brson I've looked over this and it looks great overall! I left a few minor comments.\n\nI guess the main question is whether we're comfortable moving to an iterator for encoding despite the current perf loss. \n\nThe fact that the code _using_ `encode_blah` seems to get worse is an important sign, I think, that iterators might not be the right choice. I would be vote for leaving the `encode_foo` methods in their original form for now. We're hoping to move `Reader` and `Writer` into `core` soon, and perhaps we could revisit this question then. I think having a custom buffer-based API is also fine, though.\n\nI do feel differently about the escape functions, though, which were just using internal iteration; I think we should keep your changes for those.\n",
