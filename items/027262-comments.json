    "body": "Thanks for the feedback!\n\nMy use case is the following: I had a `Vec<char>` that I wanted to turn into a `String` using `vec.into()` (it just looked straightforward). I found it surprising that it was not implemented... why shouldn't it? The only requirement is to implement `From`.\n\nAlthough the documentation of `From` doesn't say anything about overhead, the fact that it is implemented to construct a `String` from a `&str` (allocating) shows that it doesn't matter that much. Additionally, the documentation of `Into` explicitly mentions that the overhead may be high or low.\n\nMaybe I am missing something, but I think it is logical to expect that a `String` can be constructed from a `Vec<char>`\n",
