    "body": "@brson I was concerned about overflow behavior as well when making the libtime version of SteadyTime. From looking at boost/C++11's implementations, it seems like everyone assumes that overflow doesn't occur. Windows guarantees that overflow won't happen for at least a century or two of uptime, and I bet the same is roughly true in practice for OSX and Linux. Leaving time information in the native formats for as long as possible should help as well with overflow behavior.\n",
