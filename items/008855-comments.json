    "body": "OK, I've updated this. Captured variables and complex by-value arguments are now handled \"the right way\". That is, the code now always provides an `alloca` to `llvm.dbg.declare` which allows LLVM to correctly deal with various transformations (such as mem2reg). This should now really be stable and work the same on all platforms.\n\nNote, however, that this sometimes introduces new allocas just for use by debug information. The specific cases are:\n- Every closure has an additional alloca holding a pointer to the its environment data\n- The 'optimized path' for immutable non-immediate-type by-value arguments is disabled, so the value is always actually copied into the function's activation record.\n  These two things are only done when extra-debug-info is enabled, so this should not lead to performance regressions for non-debug builds.\n\nThe only thing that does not yet use this more stable method is self argument descriptions. They have rather specialized handling in the code and I haven't gotten around to analyse this.\n",
