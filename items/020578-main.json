  "body": "This PR removes boxed closures from the language, the closure type syntax (`let f: |int| -> bool = /* ... */`) has been obsoleted. Move all your uses of closures to the new unboxed closure system (i.e. `Fn*` traits).\n\n[breaking-change] patterns\n- `lef f = || {}`\n\nThis binding used to type check to a boxed closure. Now that boxed closures are gone, you need to annotate the \"kind\" of the unboxed closure, i.e. you need pick one of these: `|&:| {}`, `|&mut:| {}` or `|:| {}`.\n\nIn the (near) future we'll have closure \"kind\" inference, so the compiler will infer which `Fn*` trait to use based on how the closure is used. Once this inference machinery is in place, we'll be able to remove the kind annotation from most closures.\n- `type Alias<'a> = |int|:'a -> bool`\n\nUse a trait object: `type Alias<'a> = Box<FnMut(int) -> bool + 'a>`. Use the `Fn*` trait that makes sense for your use case.\n- `fn foo(&self, f: |uint| -> bool)`\n\nIn this case you can use either a trait object or an unboxed closure:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo(&self, f: F) where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool;\n// or\nfn foo(&self, f: Box<FnMut(uint) -> bool>);\n```\n- `struct Struct<'a> { f: |uint|:'a -> bool }`\n\nAgain, you can use either a trait object or an unboxed closure:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Struct<F> where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool { f: F }\n// or\nstruct Struct<'a> { f: Box<FnMut(uint) -> bool + 'a> }\n```\n- Using `|x, y| f(x, y)` for closure \"borrows\"\n\nThis comes up in recursive functions, consider the following (contrived) example:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo(x: uint, f: |uint| -> bool) -> bool {\n    //foo(x / 2, f) && f(x)  // can't use this because `f` gets moved away in the `foo` call\n    foo(x / 2, |x| f(x)) && f(x)  // instead \"borrow\" `f` in the `foo` call\n}\n```\n\nIf you attempt to do the same with unboxed closures you'll hit \"\"error: reached the recursion limit during monomorphization\" (see #19596):\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<F>(x: uint, mut f: F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\n    foo(x / 2, |x| f(x)) && f(x)\n    //~^ error: reached the recursion limit during monomorphization\n}\n```\n\nInstead you _should_ be able to write this:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<F>(x: uint, mut f: F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\n    foo(x / 2, &mut f) && f(x)\n    //~^ error: the trait `FnMut` is not implemented for the type `&mut F`\n}\n```\n\nBut as you see above `&mut F` doesn't implement the `FnMut` trait. `&mut F` _should_ implement the `FnMut` and the above code _should_ work, but due to a bug (see #18835) it doesn't (for now).\n\nYou can work around the issue by rewriting the function to take `&mut F` instead of `F`:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<F>(x: uint, f: &mut F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\n    foo(x / 2, f) && (*f)(x)\n}\n```\n\nThis finally works! However writing `foo(0, &mut |x| x == 0)` is unergonomic. So you can use a private helper function to avoid this:\n\n``` rust\n// public API function\npub fn foo<F>(x: uint, mut f: F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\n    foo_(x, &mut f)\n}\n\n// private helper function\nfn foo_<F>(x: uint, f: &mut F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\n    foo_(x / 2, f) && (*f)(x)\n}\n```\n\nCloses #14798\n\n---\n\nThere is more cleanup to do: like renaming functions/types from `unboxed_closure` to just `closure`, removing more dead code, simplify functions which now have unused arguments, update the documentation, etc. But that can be done in another PR.\n\nr? @nikomatsakis @aturon (You probably want to focus on the deleted/modified tests.)\ncc @eddyb \n",
