This restriction should either be imposed on both `use` and `type` or on none of them.\nSecond, unlike for `use`s, `VisiblePrivateTypesVisitor` don't go down the chain of `type` aliases to check the exported-ness of the original type, but it should. `VisiblePrivateTypesVisitor` is not well aligned with other parts of privacy in general.\n\n(I'm currently rewriting all this, I've finished `EmbargoVisitor` and going to proceed to `VisiblePrivateTypesVisitor` soon)\n",

    "body": "@petrochenkov OK, thanks for the heads up that you're doing a rewrite. I was going to look at a couple issues in this vicinity as well, but maybe you can factor them in:\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28325\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28514\n\nThe current goal is to get all of this checking in line with the [relevant RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/200). We may want to loosen some of the rules, eventually, but for now we should hew toward the conservative spec. The fundamental guarantee in the spec is that a type _definition_ may only escape a module if it is marked `pub`. It's a bit less clear about aliases.\n\nI definitely agree that `use` and `type` should have the same privacy restrictions.\n",

Rather, I think it is legal to `pub use` a public type from a private module. As I understand the rules, they are very simple: if an item is declared as `pub`, then it is considered public to the entire outside world and can thus be re-exported by anyone who can reach it.\n\n(I happen to think we should extend this system somewhat, probably by allowing you to limit pub declarations to some enclosing modules, but this is the system we have today.)\n\n> However, use have one artificial restriction - it can reexport only \"shallowly public\" types, i.e. marked with pub, but possibly residing in private modules. type doesn't have this restriction. This restriction should either be imposed on both use and type or on none of them.\n\nI don't understand this restriction, can you clarify what it is? I think probably both `pub use` and `pub type` should be limited to items declared as `pub`, and it doesn't really matter whether the modules they are declared in are private or public, so long as they are _accessible_ to the one who declared the `pub use` and `pub type`.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis \n\n> I don't think this is a hole. Rather, I think it is legal to pub use a public type from a private module. As I understand the rules, they are very simple: if an item is declared as pub, then it is considered public to the entire outside world and can thus be re-exported by anyone who can reach it.\n> (Unless by hole you just meant that we get link time errors, in which case I agree there is some sort of bug with the linker's code that identifies reachable symbols.)\n\nIn this case `EmbargoVisitor` (supplying symbols for the linker, among the other things) and `VisiblePrivateTypesVisitor` are in serious contradiction. Supposedly, `EmbargoVisitor` follows the older version of the privacy RFC, because it exports only things that are _actually_ reexported from private inner modules to outside with `pub use` or `pub type` and not just _can_ be reexported because they are marked with `pub`.\nExample:\n\n```\nmod private { pub struct PubMarked; }\npub fn f() -> private::PubMarked { ... } // Not exported by EmbargoVisitor, linker errors are possible\n```\n\n```\npub use private::PubMarked as Pub;\nmod private { pub struct PubMarked; }\npub fn f() -> private::PubMarked { ... } // Exported by EmbargoVisitor, because of `pub use`\n```\n\nIf `EmbargoVisitor` starts exporting everything `pub` in whatever inner modules, then rustdoc, stability pass, reachability pass etc. will be flooded by `pub`-but-not-actually-public items, because they also use the exported set provided by `EmbargoVisitor` :D\n",

    "body": "To some extent, this is water under the bridge, at least until another RFC is written. However, the problem with the initial formulation, from my POV, is that, under that formulation, just looking at a declaration (say, of a struct) did not give you the full story of its scoping. The story is simpler today: if you see `pub`, you know that it is public to the world (or, at least, that is all the language is guaranteeing you). The way this played out at the time was that we literally could not tell whether the code was correctly implemented or not, because it wasn't enough to look at the definitions involved, one had to go over the code to find all `pub uses` and so forth.\n\nOne flaw, though, is that the story of `pub` is now _too_ simple to do the things you want: there are types that should not be public to the whole world, but only to some subset of the module tree (or perhaps just to the current crate), but we have no way to declare this. I'd like to extend the `pub` syntax to let you declare this. But I don't want to _infer_ the access level based on what is exported: I think things are often exported in error, and it's better to declare at the site of the item how far you _intend_ for it to be exported, and then check that the exports obey that declaration. This lets you reason about a module in isolation, rather than looking at how others choose to `pub use` its contents.\n\nAll that said, I think that evaluating the overall reachability of items (versus checking whether they obey the \"no private things in public APIs\" rule) seems to just be two distinct concepts, and we have to deal with that. (That is, I'm not sure that collapsing both into one visitor is a good direction, though clearly they share some common code -- probably the bit that computes the successors to a given node in the reachability graph.) Evaluating the reachable set seems, however, to be a fairly straightforward process: it's just a DFS over the reachability graph, stopping at private edges, right?\n",

Fixing https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28325 and other issues has some fallout too, but less than `pub type`. It will require at least a couple of crater runs, periods of warnings for the most significant breakage points and everything like this. (And I haven't even considered associated types yet.)\n\nAlso, strictly speaking, almost everything involving public traits should be `pub` due to type inference [being too smart](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/limits-of-type-inference-smartness/2919/5), but I'm going close my eyes on this so far (or maybe fix it somehow).\n",
