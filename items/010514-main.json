  "body": "This is based off of @blake2-ppc's work on #9429. That PR bitrotted and I haven't been able to contact the original author so I decided to take up the cause.\n# Overview\n\n`Mut` encapsulates a mutable, non-nullable slot. The `Cell` type is currently used to do this, but `Cell` is much more commonly used as a workaround for the inability to move values into non-once functions. `Mut` provides a more robust API.\n\n`Mut` duplicates the semantics of borrowed pointers with enforcement at runtime instead of compile time.\n\n``` rust\nlet x = Mut::new(0);\n\n{\n    // make some immutable borrows\n    let p = x.borrow();\n    let y = *p.get() + 10;\n\n    // multiple immutable borrows are allowed simultaneously\n    let p2 = x.borrow();\n\n    // this would throw a runtime failure\n    // let p_mut = x.borrow_mut();\n}\n\n// now we can mutably borrow\nlet p = x.borrow_mut();\n*p.get() = 10;\n```\n\n`borrow` returns a `Ref` type and `borrow_mut` returns a `RefMut` type, both of which are simple smart pointer types with a single method, `get`, which returns a reference to the wrapped data.\n\nThis also allows `RcMut<T>` to be deleted, as it can be replaced with `Rc<Mut<T>>`.\n# Changes\n\nI've done things a little bit differently than the original proposal.\n- I've added `try_borrow` and `try_borrow_mut` methods that return `Option<Ref<T>>` and `Option<RefMut<T>>` respectively instead of failing on a borrow check failure. I'm not totally sure when that'd be useful, but I don't see any reason to not put them in and @cmr requested them.\n- `ReadPtr` and `WritePtr` have been renamed to `Ref` and `RefMut` respectively, as `Ref` is to `ref foo` and `RefMut` is to `ref mut foo` as `Mut` is to `mut foo`.\n- `get` on `MutRef` now takes `&self` instead of `&mut self` for consistency with `&mut`. As @alexcrichton pointed, out this violates soundness by allowing aliasing `&mut` references.\n- `Cell` is being left as is. It solves a different problem than `Mut` is designed to solve.\n- There are no longer methods implemented for `Mut<Option<T>>`. Since `Cell` isn't going away, there's less of a need for these, and I didn't feel like they provided a huge benefit, especially as that kind of `impl` is very uncommon in the standard library.\n# Open Questions\n- `Cell` should now be used exclusively for movement into closures. Should this be enforced by reducing its API to `new` and `take`? It seems like this use case will be completely going away once the transition to `proc` and co. finishes.\n- Should there be `try_map` and `try_map_mut` methods along with `map` and `map_mut`?\n",
