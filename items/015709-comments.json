    "body": "@huonw is correct, this is not an appropriate syntax error. `type_overflow` needs to be the one to emit this. Since as you say `type_overflow` can't even tell that the problem occurred, the correct solution is to figure out how the AST needs to change to fix this.\n\nPersonally, I think that integral literals in the AST simply need to support unsized values (or at least, absurdly-sized values). This will be necessary if we ever want to add support for user-defined types to be initialized from literals (e.g. `BigInt`).\n\nA smaller change might be to add a `bool` flag to `LitInt` that indicates whether it overflowed during parsing. That could then be checked by the `type_overflow` lint and ignored everywhere else. Granted, that's still not a trivial change, because every single instance of `LitInt` in the source would need to be updated for the extra field, but at least it doesn't change the semantics of parsing and likely has a negligible performance impact (I can't imagine signed numeric literals are used frequently enough for it to matter).\n",

    "body": "Alternatively, `LitInt` and `LitUint` could be combined into a single variant, with the value always stored as a `u64`, and a boolean flag added to indicate whether the literal value in the source was negative. Again, not a small change, but it does seem a bit odd to me to have two separate literal variants for integers. Actually it's 3, because there's also LitIntUnsuffixed. Seems to me all 3 should be a single literal type, with a type parameter that covers both signed and unsigned integral types, as well as the idea of unsuffixed (which would likely make it `Option<IntTy>` rather than being a separate variant).\n",
