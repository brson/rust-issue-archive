You can do `git rebase -i` on the parent commit before all these and delete the other commits. Then rebase (not merge) your commits onto the changes from master. An alternative would be getting master to a clean up-to-date state, checking out a new branch and using `git cherry-pick` to apply your changes to it.\n",
