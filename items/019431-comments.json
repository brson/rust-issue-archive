Additionally, do you have benchmark numbers for the before/after to justify the `unsafe`? I would expect writers with a need for speed to use the `Writer` implementation on `Vec<u8>`, not on a `MemWriter` (which will probably slow down with a `Seek` implementation in the future.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton: I removed `eof` and the unsafe code for now. My benchmarking showed that the safe and unsafe code performed nearly the same, but with a slight edge for unsafe code, which probably isn't that important.\n\nRegarding speed, this is working on `BufWriter`, not `MemWriter` :) The neat thing is that even this safe version is approximately as fast as just using `ptr::copy_nonoverlapping_memory`. `Vec<u8>`/`MemWriter` for some reason are at least twice as slow as `&[u8]`/`BufWriter`, even if we aren't growing the underlying vector. Not sure why yet.\n",
