I'm not exactly sure how to compare two `PolyTraitRef`s though.\n\n(I don't think handling cases like this requires dynamic multi-dispatch: the trait A contains `PartialEq<Foo>` and `PartialEq<Bar>` in its vtable, and any call is statically resolved to one or the other.)\n",

    "body": "A couple of notes:\n1. This was intended to work, and it indeed does not require dynamic multiple dispatch, though it does allow you to emulate overloading based on argument type to some extent. \n2. The code was originally written with the assumption however that a given supertrait occured at most once, so yeah it looks like some of it was not correctly updated. Off the top of my head, I'm not sure what's required to check the full trait ref, I'll have to go look at the code.\n3. I feel like this is a dup of an issue somewhere :)\n",
