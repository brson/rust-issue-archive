  "body": "This removes a large array of deprecated functionality, regardless of how\nrecently it was deprecated. The purpose of this commit is to clean out the\nstandard libraries and compiler for the upcoming alpha release.\n\nSome notable compiler changes were to enable warnings for all now-deprecated\ncommand line arguments (previously the deprecated versions were silently\naccepted) as well as removing deriving(Zero) entirely (the trait was removed).\n\nThe distribution no longer contains the libtime or libregex_macros crates. Both\nof these have been deprecated for some time and are available externally.\n",
