    "body": "@seanmonstar The intended use of stability attributes is to give _finer-grained control_ over semver; not everything needs to (or should) be marked stable at a 1.0 release unless you really want to make all of those promises.\n\nIn general, the intended approach is to slowly annotate items over time with greater stability, even before 1.0 -- this was what we're doing for the standard library, for example.\n\nBy not inheriting `#[stable]`, we remove two kinds of easy mistakes:\n1. If you add an item to an already-stable module, generally that new item should _not_ be immediately stable -- it should likely be experimental. With this approach, it worst it is considered unmarked (which counts as unstable.)\n2. If you are changing a `#[stable]` API, you _always_ know, because the attribute it local to the item. This makes it easier to catch stability regressions.\n\nHope that helps. This is definitely something we can tweak over time.\n",
