    "body": "By the way, I think the only way to implement this safely is for \nvectors, because they can use a while loop. For other code that uses a \ngeneric `each()` method, I believe unsafe code is needed to manage the \nmoves. I have not come up with a simple way for the type system to prove \nthe absence of troublesome recursion (once fns are complex enough to \nprove safe---and they don't address this problem). But I think the \ninterface should still be correct, as @brson says, even if it requires \nan unsafe impl for the generic case.\n",
