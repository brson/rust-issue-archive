Unneeded maintenance\n  burden.\n\n# unix installer\n- Create a rust-installer repo to house install.sh so that Rust,\n  Cargo and the combined installer all use the same base script.\n  Create another script, make-installer.sh that generates the\n  customized install.sh script and builds the tarball from an\n  on-disk template. Update Rust and Cargo to use this.\n- Change install.sh to support multiple manifests so that the combined\n  installer can use both. This allows the Rust, Cargo, and\n  combined installers to interoperate (e.g. the Cargo uninstaller\n  will work on a combined install).\n- Have build-unix-installer.py do the dirty work of driving\n  combine-from-tarballs.py and make-installer.sh.\n\n# potential improvements\n- Change the Rust manifest to lib/rustlib/rust-manifest.in and the\n  cargo to lib/rustlib/cargo-manifest.in for consistency? Paves the\n  way for more Rust 'components' (which there may never be since we\n  have a package manager - once cargo is installed you use it).  I\n  would rather have cargo's manifest in the rustlib dir though.  This\n  would require adding compatibility code to the uninstaller to handle\n  upgrades.\n\n# OS X package\n- Similar to the windows installer\n\n# automation\n- To start we'll add completely new nightly/beta/stable dist builders\n  that run in parallel to the old, since we're going to have to roll\n  this out in stages.\n\n@alexcrichton What you think?\n",

    "body": "Sounds great!\n- Is there any particular reason `get-component-tarballs.py` builds rust from source, but not cargo?\n- Can you remind me where the source tarballs play into all this? Are they just generated by the nightly builders? I don't think we should ship a combined source tarball, but we should make sure the source tarballs are next to each other. Note that cargo does not currently have a source tarball (not that it would be terribly useful anyway).\n- What are the prerequisites to `build-windows-installer.py` and the OSX pkg builder?\n- The exe/pkg installers would be _only_ combined, right? (that's what I would expect).\n- Cargo has a hefty amount of licenses, so we should make sure that they're displayed prominently (especially the GPLv2 one). They're installed into `$prefix/share/doc/cargo`, so they're somewhere, but they should probably be at the top-level of the tarball as well?\n",

    "body": "Let me clarify that at the end of this the current Rust dist builders will not exist and the combined dist builder will create and upload both the Rust and combined artifacts (and also Cargo - see first point).\n- The reason it builds _rust_ from source is so we don't have to worry about build dependencies in the automation (e.g. buildbot doesn't have to do the rust build then trigger the combined build). The reason it doesn't do the cargo build itself is because cargo only has nightlies currently, so the combined builders for all release channels are going to be building the same cargo nightlies. This reason is pretty weak though and we could make the beta/stable channels just not upload the cargo artifacts. I'll make that change, but that means that we're going to have to _also_ download the _current_ Rust nightly to build Cargo (we can't count on Cargo building with all Rust release channels).\n- The source tarballs will be produced and uploaded by the combined builder as part of the Rust dist build on Linux, but aren't used beyond that (there's no combined source tarball).\n- The prereqs for the windows and pkg combined build are the same as for Unix - Run the Rust/Cargo build to produce the Unix installer tarball, which is then re-extracted to turn into the Windows installer. The on-disk layout is the same for all installers (with the slight exception that on Windows we dump everything in bin, _even_ in the Unix-style installer).\n- exe/pkg are only combined and support is dropped from the Rust repo\n- I'll put some more thought into how to combine the licenses at the top level.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton my intention was to run a periodic cron job to promote the artifacts from the staging directory to the distribution directory on s3. My concern with doing the same thing with buildbot was that something has to trigger buildbot to do the build based on the status of the dist directory.\n\nWe could have that cron job do multiple things, both promote from staging to dist, and kick off the combined build, though I kind of would prefer not to do that, keeping the bits of automation separate. If we do have that script start the combined build then we need some way to trigger buildbot, which i don't know how to do offhand, but is surely possible.\n\nIf we really wanted to we could probably do this and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14431#issuecomment-56217393 not as a cron job but as part of the buildbot script, running in response to successful dist builds, though of course I'm loath to pack more functionality into our script.\n\nI'm somewhat worried about the possibility of race conditions causing commit mismatches across the variety of platforms we support, particularly with cargo. I've read mention of locks in buildbot, so we may be able to just throw in a big lock that protects the combined builds from the individual builds.\n",

    "body": "OK, here's the plan as I see it currently, though details are still vague to me.\n\nI am still maintaining the premise that the cargo and rust builds should remain entirely separate. The reasons for this are pretty squishy, I admit: the current independent development model is working well; both builds are very complex and self-hosting, so combining them doubly-so; cargo and rust won't necessarily always support the same platforms, so it may continue to be desirable to produce rustc installers independently.\n- First, factor out `install.sh`, used by both cargo and rust, into a new project `rust-installer`, which generates installers in the form of tarballs. This is almost done.\n- Upgrade rust-installer to support some new features:\n  - Installer versioning: the installer drops a file `rustlib/rust-installer-version` that just contains a number, for versioning the installer for future backwards-incompatible changes.\n  - Components: the `rustlib/components` file just contains a list of component names. Each of these has a corresponding manifest called `rustlib/manifest-${component}`.\n  - Installing / removing entire directories at once: to fix https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14916. Under the current model, we cp or rm every file individually, but that is very slow with our massive documentation set. Under this scheme `/lib/share/doc/rust` would be copied and deleted with a single command. Requires a new manifest format, so I want to just do this at the same time as upgrading the installer version.\n  - Upgrading from the old, non-versioned format.\n- Add a new script to `rust-installer` than unpacks two installers for different components and recombines them into a single installer.\n\nAt _that point_ we can create a `rust-combined-installer` project that actually merges the two installers, and builds the various other installers, like .msi and .pkg.\n- Rename the rust artifacts to `rustc-${version}`, to make room for a new `rust` package.\n- Do everything else.\n",
