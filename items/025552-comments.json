    "body": "@GuillaumeGomez ah, I see now.\n\nIn that case, the main changes I would suggest are:\n- In E0067, it should say at the beginning \"The left-hand side of a [compound assignment](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference.html#compound-assignment-expressions) expression ...\"\n  - (or \"compound assignment operator\", if you prefer.  The important thing is that its not just a normal assignment operator.)\n- The \"good\" examples in E0067 and E0070 should _both_ be revised.\n  - The \"Good\" example in E0067 is not a compound assignment.  It should use some example involving e.g. `+=`, the same way that the \"bad\" example uses a compound assignment.\n  - It would be better if the \"Good\" example in E0070 also included cases that illustrate the other kinds of l-values like dereferences `*x = ...;` and field accesses `x.foo = ...;`\n  - Finally, I would argue that all of the \"Good\" examples in both E0067 and E0070 should avoid using a `let x = ...` form as the example of a well-formed assignment expression.\n    \n    The use of a `let`-binding is very confusing, since the text here is about the left-hand side of an _assignment_ operator.  The rules for `let`-bindings are incomparable with the rules for assignments.  \n    \n    And I mean they are incomparable in a formal sense: Neither one is a super-set of the other.  Some examples of how the rules for binding versus assignment are incomparable:\n    \n    ``` rust\n    (x, y) = (1, 2); // you cannot do this (at least not today; there may be a postponed RFC asking for it)\n    let (x, y) = (1, 2); // but you can do this\n    \n    let x.foo = 3; // you cannot do this (and almost certainly never will be able to)\n    x.foo = 3; // but you can do this\n    ```\n",

It seems pretty accurate for me... Let's take your examples:\n\n``` Rust\n(x, y) = (1, 2); // you cannot do this (at least not today; there may be a postponed RFC asking for it)\n// -> it seems logical since you have to declare it before\nlet (x, y) = (1, 2); // but you can do this\n// -> which is done here\n\nlet x.foo = 3; // you cannot do this (and almost certainly never will be able to)\n// -> you can't allocate just a sub element of a struct without allocating the struct\nx.foo = 3; // but you can do this\n// -> it's just assigning a value to a sub element of an allocated struct\n```\n\nSo that's where I don't follow you. `let` seems quite simple to understand for me.\n",
