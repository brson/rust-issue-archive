  "body": "r? @graydon\n\nThis is the bulk of the makefile work necessary to support cross-compiling with multiple toolchains. With this we can cross-compile to Android, but not run the test suite on Android. There is still some polish yet to add, but I want to get this merged.\n\nKey changes:\n- The build now thinks about three kinds of triples: the _build_ triple, which is the architecture the rust build takes place on, the _host_ triples, which are architectures for which the rust build produces rust compliers, and the _target_ triples, which are architectures for which the produced compilers can compile code. The host triples contain the build triple, and the target triples are a superset of the host triples.\n- `platform.mk` produces distinct toolchain variables (CC, CXX, etc.) for each target triple, and in turn most of the makefiles are now parametrized over target triples.\n- `configure` requires `--android-ndk-path` when `arm-unknown-android` is a target triple\n\nAs an example, to cross-compile to android, you configure with `../configure --target-triples=arm-unknown-android --android-ndk-path=~/dev/android-standalone-ndk-14`. In this case the build triple and the host triples are automatically inferred, and the build triple added to the target triples, so if you are running on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, build-triple=`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, host-triples=`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and target-triples=`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu,arm-unknown-android`.\n\nThanks to @yichoi who did most of this work.\n\nIssue #4513.\n",
