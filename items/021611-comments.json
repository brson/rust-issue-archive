I know the module is already marked stable, but I really feel like it should be renamed to `preferred_align_of` and `min_align_of` be changed to `align_of`. Every single time I've ever had a reason to look at alignment, minimum alignment turns out to be what I was interested in. May as well make it the default function.\n\nSimilarly, the documentation on what is currently `align_of` claims that this is the alignment that, if adhered to, guarantees the type will function properly. Surely that's actually the minimum alignment. The docs should be changed instead to explain that this is the preferred alignment, and hopefully give a short explanation as to what the heck that actually means.\n",
