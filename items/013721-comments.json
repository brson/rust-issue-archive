    "body": "Ran in to another use-case for #13009 that would be alleviated by allowing private impls: I'm trying to test an iterator that returns `std::path::Path` but I can't use `assert_eq!` on any of the results (neither `.collect()` to a vector, nor the `Option<Path>` returns of the `.next()` method itself) because of the missing `std::fmt::Show` trait. In this case, I could even gate the private impl in `#[cfg(test)]` to keep in the spirit of not using `Path` as a string in my normal code.\n",

    "body": "For the latter, you could map to a byte vector (either `&[u8]` or `Vec<u8>`, depending on lifetime requirements) and assert equality there. That will be equivalent to asserting equality on the `Path` (`Path`'s impl of `Eq` actually just compares the internal byte vector).\n\nAs for your struct, here's a wacky idea. We could extend `#[deriving(Show)]` to let you override the display of individual fields. Something like\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(Show)]\nstruct MyStruct {\n    x: int\n    #[deriving_show=\"p.display()\"]\n    p: Path\n    y: int\n}\n```\n\nI don't know if this really is a great idea, but it's probably easier than coming up with some way to privately implement a trait for an external type.\n",

That's precisely what `HandlerFunc` is doing. And you can do the exact same thing in Rust.\n\n``` rust\nstruct ShowablePath(Path);\n\nimpl Show for ShowablePath {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe downside is you need to explicitly unwrap `ShowablePath` to get at the underlying `Path`, but you could mitigate that by implementing `Deref` as well to do the unwrapping for you.\n",
