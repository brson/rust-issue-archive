The docs say that using `error-pattern: ...` is frowned upon and instead to make use of `//~ ERROR` comments. However, I am reporting my message as a note, should I still use an `//~ ERROR` comment?\n\nThe documentation on this matter is rather thin. At least any documentation I have found. Pointers to more relevant info would be welcome.\n",
