With future traits we plan on implementing, do you think that this is an adequate replacement for `~[T]`?\n\nI'm also curious if there are patterns that were concise previously but verbose now. There seem to be lots of spots in this diff which have gotten more verbose, but most of them look like they could be reduced.\n\nI commented on a few places (obviously just spot checking), and I just wanted to make sure that there's a relatively nice way of expressing those.
