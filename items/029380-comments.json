    "body": "It might be appropriate to point out that `vec`'s implementation of `Index` will result in panics upon out-of-bound, but it should also be expected from conventions and from its signature (it does not return an `Option`).\nIt might be desirable to mention that functions which perform allocations might either panic or `oom()` (abort the whole application instead of the panicking thread). I remember that some discussion had already happened on this (about whether it was an inconsistency to be fixed or not), but I do not think this has been documented.\n",
