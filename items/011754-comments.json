    "body": "That's not a bad idea, but for now I'd rather lean in the direction of keeping the lint super simple and easy to understand. The major use case this is trying to solve is silently ignoring return values from I/O operations _by accident_. If you specify a `_` in a pattern, you had to at least _explicitly_ ignore it (or at least that's the idea).\n\nI think that the best trial run for this lint will be removing conditions from libstd. If it turns out that this lint isn't sufficient enough to catch most of the ignored errors (as today there are _many_ because conditions fail by default), then we should certainly revisit this at that point.\n\nBasically for now I want to try to keep this as simple as possible, but I don't mind revisiting at all if we start seeing common patterns that ignore errors.\n",
