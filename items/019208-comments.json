    "body": "This is caused by the compiler indexing out of bounds while trying to print lines for diagnostics and is heavily dependent on the precise structure of which macros are used, their internals and the offsets/spacing in the main file. As such ever instance is subtly different and it can appear/disappear as the macros change slightly, but they all have the common threads of macros and previous diagnostics.\n\nThere's quite a few other dupes of #14091 linked on that bug, some of which are closer to this. There's so currently a PR open that apparently fixes these bugs. (I'm on my phone so cannot easily find them myself right now.)\n",
