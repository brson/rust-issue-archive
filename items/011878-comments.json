    "body": "> It's not really much better than using `(*x).foo`\n\nI think it's _a lot_ more ergonomic, especially when chaining: `(*(*x).y).foo` versus `x->y->foo`, which is rather common. It's not an accident that C and C++ added it.\n\n> and doesn't scale to multiple levels of indirection\n\nTrue. Again, we could follow C++ and have it resolve to the most-indirect method. Having pointers-to-pointers is not so common, and wanting to call a method on a pointer in the middle even less so, which can still be done explicitly (`(*outer_pointer).inner_pointer_method()`).\n\n> A `Clone` implementation for `&T` is a necessity, as is a `Clone` implementation for types that aren't references.\n\nThis is more general than either `Clone` (there are many other traits) or `&T` (we will have library smart pointer types with autoderef). Requiring the \"cooperation\" of multiple upstreams for the problem to manifest _would_ make it something like an order of magnitude less frequent, but the question is whether we find that acceptable. We don't find it acceptable for issues of type system soundness to be merely very unlikely to be triggered, for example.\n\nEDIT: Another solution might be almost, but not quite, the inverse of the `->` solution: have `.` itself resolve unconditionally to a method on the most-indirected type, and add some new syntax to call methods on the least-indirect type (the outermost pointer). I have no idea what would be a good choice there, but just for the sake of illustration I'll go with `<-`: then `not_a_pointer.method()` would resolve to a method of `not_a_pointer`, `is_a_pointer.method()` would resolve unconditionally to a method of the innermost _pointee_ of `is_a_pointer` (so like `->`), and `is_a_pointer<-method()` would resolve to a method of `is_a_pointer`. But I'm not sure if this is any good, nor if it's worth trying to deviate from C/C++ like this. Probably not.\n",

If someone adds a struct and you import it with a glob, your code won't end up doing different things than it did before.\n\nIt also depends on how narrowly you define upstream/downstream. Even within the same module, having to worry about whether any code in that module has a pattern with the same name before you can safely add a `static` is not nice. So it's the same general issue.\n\n@pnkfelix I was intending this ticket to be about the general property, so far `impl`s and `static`s as patterns exhibit known violations of it. I was thinking this is the right place to discuss whether/what could be done, and if anything specific is decided that _should_ be done, a new issue would be opened for it. How do you think it should work instead?\n",

    "body": "> That's true I think. Still, other items don't have this kind of effect (and rightly so). If someone adds a struct and you import it with a glob, your code won't end up doing different things than it did before.\n\nNo, they do have this effect.\n\n``` rust\nuse somemod::{Foo, bar};\nuse othermod::*;\n\nfn main() {\n     bar(Foo { x: 1 })\n}\n```\n\nif `othermod` adds `bar` and/or `Foo` to `othermod`, they will shadow the explicit imports and (in edge cases) change behavior.\n\nAlthough, iirc, the unused import warning will pick this up, but I guess the first import could be `use somemod::*;` or the shadowing glob could be inside another block, with the explicit imports used elsewhere, i.e. something like\n\n``` rust\nuse somemod::bar;\n\nfn qux() { bar() }\n\nfn main() {\n    use othermod::*;\n\n    qux();\n    bar(); // supposed to be somemod's bar\n    something_in_othermod();    \n}\n```\n\nRather than shadowing, we could have a warning for when an name is ambiguous (i.e. two imports of the same name).\n",

You don't even need `somemod`: if the outer module defines `bar()`, the same thing happens. Yet I think local items and imports shadowing ones from outer scopes feels intuitive and correct. Perhaps the right solution here would be a warning/error specifically if a _glob import_ ends up shadowing something from an outer scope, as that's the only case where it can be unintended.\n",
