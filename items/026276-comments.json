    "body": "Yeah @steveklabnik mentioned, these are stable so they can't change, but the rationale is:\n- The `String::from_utf8` function takes ownership of the underlying bytes, hence taking a `Vec`. This is a performance optimization to avoid unnecessary allocations. The sister function is `str::from_utf8` which does not take an owned vector. The `Result` returned here has an error payload specific to decoding utf-8 bytes\n- The `from_utf8_lossy` function takes a _slice_ of bytes as it tries to not allocate (a performance optimization). This also explains the `Cow` return type (because sometimes you don't have to allocate) and it lives on `String` as it may allocate to return a `String`.\n- The UTF-16 functions take slices of u16 because it can't do anything extra by taking ownership, and both return a `String` as there's no way to not allocate.\n\nOverall, to address your points:\n\n> I think it should be slices consistently for all four.\n\nTaking a `Vec` in `from_utf8` is a performance optimization, and the slice-taking variant is `str::from_utf8`.\n\n> I think the return value should be String, too.\n\nNo returning a `String` is also a performance optimization as sometimes `from_utf8_lossy` doesn't have to allocate.\n",
