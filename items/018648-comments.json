Readers with disorders like ADHD-PI tend to skim passages, especially when confronted with unnecessary asides like this one. I also understand that dyslexic readers sometimes use skimming as a technique to aid reading comprehension. Sometimes skimming is how people \"actually read.\"\n",

    "body": "Tom, I may have said things too broadly. Previously, I have gotten comments from people who have just copy and pasted things without reading the text, and complained when things don't work as they expect. The small fringe of frustration you hear is with them, not anyone with any kind of disability.\n\nBut generally, I don't know what to do with someone who is unwilling to read the text, as that's what it is! I too skim things, but if I then get an error, I say 'oh, I was skimming, I must have missed a detail, let me go back and see what's wrong.' I don't know how to serve someone who just gives up at the first sign of something being wrong. For example, how is 'open the file in your editor' going to serve someone who isn't reading the text, this feels contradictory to me?\n\nI also recognize that I am not everyone, but that's where I am coming from.\n",

    "body": "Sorry about that Steve, let's forget about the word \"skim.\" :) That was my shorthand for, \"people read technical documentation under all sorts of sub-optimal or unexpected conditions.\" \n\nTom is right. People have ADHD. People are busy and distracted. People are reading on their phones, or in poor light. People are frustrated. Most important of all, learning a new programming language from scratch has _huge_ cognitive overhead.\n\nThis is why it's important for technical documentation to be terse and clear. Now, I'm NOT saying \"terseness above all else\" -- it's okay to have your own personal style, to be more verbose, to have some asides. But keep in mind the trade-off you're making is, you're risking overloading or annoying or confusing the reader. \n\nAnd '$ editor <filename>' is a very confusing construction. That's why nearly every tutorial & guide says, \"Open the file.\"\n",
