  "body": "please snap.\n\nthis makes all math leftovers explicitly depend on the new core::\\* equivalents to the degree possible now.\n\nhopefully after this is snapped, some leftover mods can be removed from std.  there is a dependency from math to math_f32 and math_f64 which i could not untangle in this round, hope that gets possible after this patch.\n",
