  "body": "Runway for RFC 809 (overloaded box/placement-in) by adding type annotations or explicit calls to `Box::new` where I found it necessary on PR #22086.\n\nI have broken this up into more than one PR because the entire commit chain (see PR #22086) is long, widespread and unwieldy to rebase frequently.\n\nTo my knowledge this is not a breaking change.  Also, there is in principle nothing stopping someone from reverting some/all of these annotations, since without the rest of the commit chain in #22086, the associated code would continue to compile.\n\nAll I can do is ask: Try to discourage others from removing seemingly \"unnecessary\" uses of the `Box` type or the `Box::new()` function, until the rest of RFC 809 lands.\n",
