    "body": "Yeah I was trying to hide the `test` crate entirely to avoid taking the name and to avoid committing ourselves to distributing that crate itself. I agree with you though that I'm still a little uncomfortable with this because we're still forced to distribute _something_. That and the \"you need to import this always\" is a little unfortunate.\n\nI can think of a few alternatives:\n1. Don't stabilize the benchmarking infrastructure entirely. This involves taking no action from where we are today.\n2. Alter the signature of benchmarking functions to _only_ require libstd types. For example each benchmarking function could have a signature like:\n   - `fn() -> Box<FnMut()>` - the \"run one iteration\" closure is returned after some setup, closing over all necessary variables.\n   - `fn(f: FnOnce(&mut FnMut()))` - the \"run one iteration\" closure is handed to `f` which then executes the entire benchmarking job.\n   \n   The downside for both of these is that we don't get the nice \"MB/s\" display as we can't set the `num_bytes` variable, but the upside is that you don't need to import anything and it should all \"just work\" without `extern crate test`. Another downside is that there's nowhere for `black_box` to go.\n3. Stabilize the name `test`, but only have `Bencher`/`black_box` as `#[stable]` inside of libtest.\n\nI'd almost personally lean towards option 1... thoughts @brson or @aturon?\n",
