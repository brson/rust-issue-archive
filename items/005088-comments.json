    "body": "I'm not quite sure what you were going for here... it's not quite what I meant to suggest, anyhow.  I meant to suggest that if you have:\n\n```\ntrait Both {\n    fn foo(&self);\n    fn bar(self);\n}\n```\n\nThen under the rules I proposed (and later retracted) in #5086, it would be illegal to have an object type `@Both`, because we can't compile handle the by-value `bar()` method since we don't know the type of the receiver.    Under today's rules, it would be legal to have the trait type `@Both` but `@Both` is not considered to implement the trait `Both`.\n\nNow, in either scenario, suppose I wanted to have a function like\n\n```\nfn do_something<B: Both>(b: &B) { ... b.foo() ... }\n```\n\nHere the point is that it only calls `foo()` and not `bar()`, so in principle it should be fine to use an object type for `B`.\n\nIn that case, I can refactor my trait `Both`  as follows:\n\n```\ntrait Foo { fn foo(&self); }\ntrait Both : Foo { fn bar(self); }\n```\n\nand I can rewrite `do_something()` as:\n\n```\nfn do_something<F: Foo>(f: &F) { ... f.foo() ... }\n```\n\nThis will work fine.  \n\nOf course, as I proposed in #5087, I'd like to say that _no object-type `@T` implements the trait `T` by default_.  But this kind of refactoring may still be relevant.  After all, it is possible to write:\n\n```\nimpl Foo for @Foo {\n    fn foo(&self) { self.foo(); }\n}\n```\n\nbut it is not legal to write\n\n```\nimpl Both for @Foo {\n    fn foo(&self) { self.foo(); }\n    fn bar(self) { self.bar(); } // illegal: cannot invoke by-val-self method on object\n}\n```\n",

In particular, the scenario I was intending to illustrate is that the default implementation of `ByDel` would use the implementation provided by `ByRef`, by invoking it.
