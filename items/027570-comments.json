At least that was the intention. I personally still favor some sort of bound as the way to generalize `transmute`. \n",

With unsafe rust, it's reversed: the compiler should let you do anything it can't _prove_ is invalid.\n\nAdding bounds to transmute allows the compiler to prove that more transmutes are valid, but there will always be some which it can't prove either way. In that case, as this is an unsafe operation, it should give the programmer the benefit of the doubt, and assume they know what they're doing.\n",

The compiler is not trying to show that your transmutes are _valid_. It's trying to check that it is even _possible_ for us to generate code for them, without either synthesizing bits or dropping bits on the floor (in the former, what value should those bits have? in the latter, what bits should we drop?). So another plausible answer would be to say \"transmute should just always compile to SOMETHING\".\n",
