    "body": "I was able to reproduce this with Rust 77c470d -- I got the segfault compiling the code unmodified, but if I changed the signature for `no_overwrite` to:\n\n```\n    fn no_overwrite<T: copy, U: copy>(m: map::hashmap<T, U>, +k: T, v: U) {\n```\n\nI didn't see the segfault (I got the output saying it was loading some data, then it ran for a long time or went into a loop, not sure which). Also, the code that calls `no_overwrite` here  -- in `load_agencies` looks very much like the offending code in #2633 (particularly, that `row_id` gets passed as an argument to `no_overwrite` as well as being a field in a record that's passed to `no_overwrite`). So I'm going to assume this is another instance of #2584 and that it's therefore fixed in Rust HEAD. (I can't verify that because the code doesn't compile in HEAD, for other reasons.)\n\nReopen if that's not so!\n",
