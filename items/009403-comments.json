    "body": "I think there are some types of examples (cross-crate, etc.) that would be very hard to get working inline at all, as we've seen with rusti.  We would also be unable to assert that, e.g., particular output happened with a convention-based approach.  I think a good option might be to maintain the examples as sets of tests, which can be required to pass or fail as needed.  Any code that is supposed to show up in the example would need to be wrapped in a block of some sort with metadata specifying that it was an example.  We could then use our existing test infrastructure to parse the examples (which could do anything our tests could do) and, if they passed, import the examples.  The only downside I can think of is that the examples wouldn't be inline with where they showed up (initially, I mean, not in the final result), but I think that's probably unavoidable to some extent for examples that span multiple files.\n",
