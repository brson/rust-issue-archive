  "body": "The original text stated that one should only return a unique or managed pointer if you were given one in the first place. This makes it sound as if the function _should_ return a unique pointer if it were given a unique pointer. The rest of the section goes on to describe why this is bad, and the example of bad code does exactly what the rule just said to do.\n\nI reworded the original rule into a reference to the more concise rule mentioned at the bottom of the section, which helps add emphasis (a la 'it bears repeating').\n",
