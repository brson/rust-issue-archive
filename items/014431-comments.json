Here's how I'd tweak it:\n- In each commit-id file, store both the commit SHA and the checksum of the tarball. That way we can download all the commit-id files, make sure the commits all match, and then when we download the tarballs we're sure we're downloading the actual tarball\n- In each tarball, _include the docs_. We should do this for distributions anyway and this way we can ensure that we're always uploading docs for the exact same version of the compiler that's being distributed.\n- As part of the `dist-promote.py` script, unpack the tarball and sync docs to the relevant doc folder on S3.\n",
