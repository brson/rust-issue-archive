    "body": "@edwardw Sorry for the late reply. `self.len()` just expands to `self.dot(self).sqrt()`, which is what you see in the original question. The code I linked on github is a little newer, and 'post-question', so to speak. To my mind it doesn't change the issue at all. By now I have far more code that uses the `Float` trait as constraint for a type parameter, and thanks to the somewhat missing type inference in this case, the code seems more bloated than it has to be (at least from my perspective of a newbie in Rust).\nEspecially when using the `Float` trait constraint, it becomes very cumbersome to program, as one cannot write something like this anymore ...\n\n``` Rust\nlet x: T = 5.0; // where T: Float,\n```\n\n``` bash\nerror: mismatched types:\n expected `T`,\n    found `_`\n(expected type parameter,\n    found floating-point variable) [E0308]\n```\n\n... which forces you to use facilities of the `Float` trait exclusively.\n\n``` Rust\nlet one: T = Float::one();\nlet x = one + one + one + one + one; // now x is 5.0T\n```\n\nI am just trying to share my experiences so far, maybe the 'issues' I run into are perfectly intended, even though they seem unnecessary to me.\n\nFor the issue above, my workaround is to not use a type parameter constrained to `Float`, but instead use a type alias. That way, type inference works as expected, while still allowing me to test the programs performance gains when using `f32` or `f64` respectively.\n\n``` Rust\nlet x: MyFloat = 5.0; // type MyFloat = f32;\n// Now I can easily set MyFloat to be f64 for example, which is what I originally intended with T: Float\n```\n",
