    "body": "I've just stumbled upon a case where `as_bytes`  doesn't suffice.\r\n\r\nMany SIMD libraries, e.g. simdjson, can be implemented more efficiently if the input buffer can be \"safely\" over-read by a dozen bytes. In Rust, a safe abstraction for such libraries can be implemented by (ab-)using `Vec<u8>`: if `capacity()` exceeds `len()` by the given amount of padding, the buffer is safe to pass to the library. This also gives the user a *safe* way to guarantee that the over-read is safe -- just `reserve` the space in the vector.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is why interfaces that take `&Vec<u8>` instead of `&[u8]` can be useful. The problem is that, given a `String`, you can't pass it to the interface, because there isn't a way to convert `&String` to `&Vec<u8>`, even though string does, in fact, have the same notion of capacity.\r\n\r\nSure, you could overload the interface for both `Vec<u8>` and `String`, or require the users to use unsafe code. But perhaps that's not the design that was expected for the implementers to use, as `String` is officially just a wrapper.\r\n\r\nShould this be an RFC?",
