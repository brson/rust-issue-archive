    "body": "@alexcrichton Sorry for not clarifying it from the start, I edited the description, hopefully it's good now.\n\nReading that RFC again, the only thing I don't handle is `impl X` where `X` is imported from a different module.\nAs of right now, the compiler claims that in such a case the import of `X` conflicts with the `impl X` \"module\".\nThat's harder to fix properly, but the error message could be improved.\n",

When I wrote RFC 57 I was concerned that allowing this would result in too specific a rule (and I was already fighting comments along the lines of \"you shouldn't be changing the language in response to the current resolve design\") for users to remember, but (a) this pattern is really useful, and (b) it is easy to provide good error messages. I'm working on the latter in #17321 --- it just needs some more unit tests and it'll be ready.\n",
