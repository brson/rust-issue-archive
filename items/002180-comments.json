    "body": "The proposal (in the bug and sent to the list) had `[T]` meaning slice. I didn't mention named regions in there at all.\n\nIn the code I'm writing here, I've deviated a bit such that `[T]/&` means slice (and I permit named regions, mostly for debugging and implementing the const region explicitly rather than by analysis-of-constness, in this pass; I think probably they'll all be inferred by context in practice).\n\nThe deviation is so that `[T]` as used in the current compiler and libraries doesn't suddenly change semantics on us. My intent is to gradually rewrite them all to use `[T]/&` and then, once there are no more uses of old-style vectors, deprecate it and switch the syntax over. Fun times.\n\nI've no opinion yet whether `[T]/&` will need to continue to exist after that rewrite, as a more-explicit form (unless maybe we find we need the ability to name regions-holding-vectors), nor whether, if so, it's written `[T]/&` or `[T]&`.\n",
