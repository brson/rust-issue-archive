    "body": "@tomjakubowski, thank you for the response. There are no users of that module as the module is private to the crate. `pub use Baz` inside the module does not seem to help; the error in that case is `error: Baz is private`. `super` does not seem to help either. Could you please clarify what you have in mind?\n",
