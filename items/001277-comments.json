    "body": "I think the way directory mods work now is fine and isn't likely to be surprising. I've seen the implicit crate mod be confusing several times now. rovar on IRC described seeing a \"multiple 'main' function\" error, which happens when you have file `foo.rc` include the line `mod foo;`\n\nA potential way to solve this is by removing the distinction between .rc and .rs files. There are very few differences between the two and combining them would eliminate more than one source of confusion.\n\nI think that if you allow filesystem-based mod declarations like those in .rc files in .rs files then .rc is redundant.\n",
