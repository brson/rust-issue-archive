    "body": "Triage: #7986 gave us `std::unstable::raw` which gives some struct definitions and provides the `.repr()` method for converting `&[T]`, `~str` etc, to them.\n\nA quick glance over the results of `git grep transmute` indicates we don't have (m)any slice transmutations that aren't using `std::unstable::raw` left after that PR. We still don't have a lint, and the current cast-to-slice method is something like:\n\n``` rust\n            unsafe {\n                cast::transmute(Slice {\n                    data: ptr::mut_offset(p, start as int) as *T,\n                    len: (end - start) * sys::nonzero_size_of::<T>()\n                })\n            }\n```\n\nwhich is far batter than it was (named fields), but not quite as self-contained as a single function.\n\n(Also, I imagine that many reviewers don't know about `std::unstable::raw` and so won't know that there is a better way; do we have a \"reviewers checklist\" to which we can add tidbits like this?)\n",
