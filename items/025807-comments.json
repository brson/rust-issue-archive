The \"last edited\" and \"release date\" should also correspond, so I think the question is which of those you think is more likely...\n\n> BTW, do we need to mention the versions? We are going to have to remember updating them every release, even though manpage content has not changed.\n\nNot strictly. Many manpages have only a modification date. However, it's useful to know what release the page refers to, so unless we can't maintain them at all, I think the version number should stay.\n\nThe real fix to to automate the version and date bump.\n",

It would be accurate to state the actual edit date, and just leave the version at **1.2.0-dev**, and only update that version just before release (or during Beta) to **1.2**, after verifying that the manpage is still accurate. So, the version should only be updated if someone verifies its accuracy... it should not be automated.\n",
