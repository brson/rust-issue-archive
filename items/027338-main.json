  "body": "This commit removes all morestack support from the compiler which entails:\n- Segmented stacks are no longer emitted in codegen.\n- We no longer build or distribute libmorestack.a\n- The `stack_exhausted` lang item is no longer required\n\nThe only current use of the segmented stack support in LLVM is to detect stack\noverflow. This is no longer really required, however, because we already have\nguard pages for all threads and registered signal handlers watching for a\nsegfault on those pages (to print out a stack overflow message). Additionally,\nmajor platforms (aka Windows) already don't use morestack.\n\nThis means that Rust is by default less likely to catch stack overflows because\nif a function takes up more than one page of stack space it won't hit the guard\npage. This is what the purpose of morestack was (to catch this case), but it's\nbetter served with stack probes which have more cross platform support and no\nruntime support necessary. Until LLVM supports this for all platform it looks\nlike morestack isn't really buying us much.\n\ncc #16012 (still need stack probes)\nCloses #26458 (a drive-by fix to help diagnostics on stack overflow)\n\nr? @brson \n",
