    "body": "I believe that the compiler is acting correctly.  The `Cell` type is\nmutable. Therefore, it is not enough for there to be a lifetime\nintersection, but rather the lifetimes must be _exactly the same_.\n(in type system terms, the types Foo and Bar are invariant with\nrespect to the lifetime parameter 'self, [wikipedia has an article\nabout it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_%28computer_science%29)).\n\nUnfortunately, as #3598 has not been fixed, all types are currently\nconsidered invariant with respect to their _type_ parameters, so the\nresults will be the same even if `Cell` had no mutable methods.\n",

That being said this (updated) code doesn't compile:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\n\nstruct Foo<'a> {\n    f: RefCell<&'a 'a ||>\n}\n\nstruct Bar<'a> {\n    f: &'a Foo<'a>\n}\n\nimpl<'a> Foo<'a> {\n    fn foo<'a>(&'a self) -> Bar<'a> {\n        Bar { f: self }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nwhile this code does\n\n``` rust\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\n\nstruct Foo<'a> {\n    f: RefCell<&'a 'a ||>\n}\n\nstruct Bar<'a> {\n    f: &'a Foo<'a>\n}\n\nimpl<'a> Foo<'a> {\n    fn foo(&'a self) -> Bar<'a> {\n        Bar { f: self }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n(note the missing `<'a>` on `fn foo`). I think that the problem here may have been something along the lines of `'self` not equal to `'a` in the original example, but from these examples it sounds like it was just a mismatch in lifetimes that are handled much better today.\n\nI'm tempted to close this as working, but I'm not sure I understand whow #3598 interacts here.\n",
