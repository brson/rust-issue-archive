  "body": "Part of #8784\n\nChanges:\n- Everything labeled under collections in libextra has been moved into a new crate 'libcollection'.\n- Renamed container.rs to deque.rs, since it was no longer 'container traits for extra', just a deque trait.\n- Crates that depend on the collections have been updated and dependencies sorted.\n- I think I changed all the imports in the tests to make sure it works. I'm not entirely sure, as near the end of the tests there was yet another `use` that I forgot to change, and when I went to try again, it started rebuilding everything, which I don't currently have time for. \n\nThere will probably be incompatibility between this and the other pull requests that are splitting up libextra. I'm happy to rebase once those have been merged.\n\nThe tests I didn't get to run should pass. But I can redo them another time if they don't.\n",
