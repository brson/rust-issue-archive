  "body": "Rust no longer has support for JIT compilation, so it doesn't currently\nrequire a PaX MPROTECT exception. The extended attributes are preferred\nover modifying the binaries so it's not actually going to work on most\nsystems like this anyway.\n\nIf JIT compilation ends up being supported again, it should handle this\nby _always_ applying the exception via an extended attribute without\nperforming auto-detection of PaX on the host. The `paxctl` tool is only\nnecessary with the older method involving modifying the ELF binary.\n",
