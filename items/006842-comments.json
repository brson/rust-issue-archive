    "body": "This idea comes out of the Data Architect world that I live in.  It's more along the lines of that basic idea that your pitching which I call \"receivership\".\n\nIn Pentaho Data Integration, there is a process step called \"Block this step until steps finish\".  What it does is Block a single step in an execution flow until a selected step or even multiple steps somewhere in the chain or process has completed it's execution and returned a True for it's \"execution complete flag\" where a launched listener is waiting and watching.\n\nIt's a generic wrapper if you will, for additional next steps to perform, but those next steps do not get called, do not get any input, and no variables are passed to them until the the child Blocking step has seen from (there's a listener process launched for each step or steps choosen to watch) all its parent or parents steps somewhere say that it's own execution has finished and lets the listener know.  I think the \"Block this step until steps finish\" just waits for all those listeners it is watching to say it's OK to proceed with it's own set of next steps.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to throw this out there... and maybe this idea should be focused on another issue, feel free to move it there... here's their Javadoc http://javadoc.pentaho.com/kettle/org/pentaho/di/trans/steps/blockuntilstepsfinish/BlockUntilStepsFinish.html\n",

    "body": "@mneumann I believe that it is not better for tasks to stay in the scheduler that created them. Here scheduler == thread, and it's easy under such a strategy not to distribute load effectively (fwiw our current scheduler never migrates tasks and it's easy to underutilize cores. This is easy to see in long running test cases that block other test cases while leaving other cores unoccupied).\n\nThe libuv context is essentially the libuv event loop, which is deeply integrated with the scheduler - it's what drives the scheduler and allows synchronous I/O to yield to other tasks - so the event loop itself cannot change threads. It may be possible in some circumstances to transplant file handles from one libuv event loop to another, but I don't think libuv currently has such functionality, and it isn't possible in all cases.\n\nWe could make a limitation that I/O handles are not sendable, but that is fairly restrictive.\n",

My comments will be only about linux, as that is the only knowledge base I have worth contributing from.\n\nIn newer kernels, the different types of events have all been unified to use file descriptors and thus be \"select\"-able with epoll_wait().  Timers can be detected with timerfd, signals with signalfd, and network and file activity with the file descriptors you are already familiar with.  Thus all these events can be handled asynchronously non-blocking in edge-triggered mode.  epoll() is thread-aware in a way that multiple threads can wait on the same epoll, and the event will go to whichever one the kernel is most enamoured with ;-)\n\nI have some very basic code (560 lines) that touches on all this if you want to see an example.\n",

    "body": "I think the \"problem\" is that libuv/libevent can only `select` on kernel events while we also want to wait for port receives which are handled in pure user level. To solve it, you have to use a regular pipe (known to the kernel) which can awake the event loop from waiting. This is how libuv implements async callbacks. Async in this context means that you invoke a callback in the same thread as the event loop, but triggered from another thread.\n\nI don't know if you will use a separate I/O task, or just one thread that performs all I/O and also runs the tasks. In the latter case you'd only have to do an async cross-thread call when:\n1. The port receive is from a task on another scheduler/native thread and\n2. this thread is currently blocked in the event loop waiting for I/O to happen.\n\nYou can special case 1. and directly schedule to the receiving task. And 2. you can handle with an async callback. Actually you can use an async callback whenever the receiving tasks lives in another scheduler. But I think you have to take care when you run the async callback (and for example schedule another thread from there) and then another async callback is triggered, you might loose it or not. \n",

The callbacks would just set a bit in the corresponding Rust I/O object, and determine if the corresponding task would become runnable as a result. After all callbacks have been run by libev, the scheduler would then \"simply\" run all runnable threads. Port receives would be triggered (as I described above) via async callbacks. An async callback is \"global\" (only one per event loop), i.e. you need to keep information about the ports which contain messages in another data structure, which then the async callback can inspect and perform the same action as for other callbacks (determine if corresponding task would become runnable).\n",

(Rust) pipes and sockets are pretty easy to adapt to each other. In particular, for the important use case of waiting on I/O while also waiting on some other signal, I think we can use an I/O-based message abstraction, i.e. something that behaves like pipes but is backed by unix domain sockets.\n",

    "body": "I'm not sure if anyone is still working on resolving this, but I just want to point out that currently there doesn't seem to be a way to 1. have a TcpSocket block on read, and 2. close the socket after a timeout.  Ideally, you would be able to select from network events and timer pipe events, but this can't be done atm.  You would think you could run the blocking read in a separate task and have it send data across a pipe, but then while you can indeed select from pipes, you can't terminate the task with the blocking read, because you can't close a task from outside.  Anyone has any thoughts how to get around this?\n",

    "body": "I disagree about including something like mio in rust std for a few reasons.\n\n1) Leaving the library separate allows it to evolve on its own timeline. Rust, the language, is going to change on a timeline different from that of libraries (like mio). By keeping it separate, users can mix and match the various versions that suit their needs (rust 2.0 & mio 1.0, rust 1.0 & mio 2.0, etc..). Using Cargo makes including & managing dependencies very low overhead.\n\n2) There is no \"one size fits all\" concurrency paradigm (async is just one concurrency paradigm). Rust supports extremely low level use cases (down to the kernel) and is also ergonomic enough to be used for higher level use cases as well. Paradigms don't match up at these various levels. I would not implement something like haproxy the same way that I would handle processing large data sets.\n\nAnyway, I say let libs compete, and once patterns emerge (post 1.0) then consider standardizing if there is a strong win to do so.\n",

It's a callback system, like most, but there is a lot of syntactic sugar, and the 3 different systems that are exposed have different levels of overhead. \n\nThe most popular is C# async/await, which generates a closure and state machine to provide a continuation callback. Stack and thread context restoration is expensive, but you can opt out per-task.\n\n F# has a simpler implementation, due to its functional nature and the ease of continuation passing.\n\nThe original used begin_[task] end_[task], i.e, https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream.beginread(v=vs.80).aspx and https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream.endread(v=vs.80).aspx\n\nI am very interested in interop between Rust and other languages, particularly F#, C#, Ruby, and Lua, and making streams interoperable between them.\n\nAre there any traits in the standard library which will describe a (callback+token/state object)-driven stream interface?  \n",
