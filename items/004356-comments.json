    "body": "Hm. Maybe! A few questions:\n- Is it intentional that this rolls in the work in #4345 ? Last time I tested that it broke the testsuite. In any case, seems plausibly unintentional in this pull req.\n- I don't quite get the difference between `begin_unwind` and `begin_unwind_` ,and why both call `raise` here.\n- Won't this iloop if there's no handler, as a missing handler calls `fail`, which translates as a call to `begin_unwind`, no? \n- It should probably be called `disable_unwind_dtors` or something, no? I mean, it is still very much unwinding, in terms of control-flow; just not running dtors while it unwinds (until it gets to the `catch` in the runtime).\n",

    "body": "- No, that's not intentional, although I would like to get #4345 in before this to avoid further bitrot. I will try to make sure that #4345 doesn't break the test suite before merging.\n- I believe `begin_unwind` is legacy. Will comment out to be sure.\n- I believe I fixed that. `begin_unwind` does not call the handler if it's missing.\n- Sure, I can change the name.\n",
