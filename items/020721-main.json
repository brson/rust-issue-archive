Note that you _don't_ need to have those traits in scope to use the indexing sugar.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\n---\n\n(I didn't address the `NOTE(stage0)` comments that didn't involve a `#[cfg(stage0)]` attribute _in this PR_ (all of them are related to `String`/`Show`). However, I did try the changes specified in those comments in a _local build_ but that ended breaking `compiletest` which resulted in ~1500 failed cfail tests, and I didn't investigate further. @seanmonstar you may want to look into it.)\n\nr? @nick29581 / @alexcrichton \n",
