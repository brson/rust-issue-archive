    "body": "You are right. I was misled by [Making Our Own Types and Typeclasses](http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses), which says:\n\n```\nIn a similar fashion, we can think of the Int type as being defined like this:\n\n    data Int = -2147483648 | -2147483647 | ... | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 2147483647\n```\n\nThat is false. According to [The Haskell 98 Report, Section 4.2](http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#user-defined-datatypes), the components to the right of the equal sign must be data constructors, not values. It turns out that we **cannot** think of the Int type as being defined that way. I hate when people teach a subject using falsehoods... (sigh)\n\nIn any case, I still think it would be a nice feature to have. \n",

    "body": "@jesseray, you define a datatype by enumerating its constructors, but then those constructors _are_ the values of that type. If I write `data Foo = A | B | C`, then the values of type `Foo` are `A`, `B`, and `C`. The analogy being made here is similar: `0`, `1`, `2` etc. can be thought of as _constructors_ for the type `Int`, and hence its possible values. So when we write `data Int = ... | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ...`, these are not already-existing values which we are referring to, rather we are bringing them into existence with our definition. (If this were valid syntax, which of course it's not.)\n\n (The analogy does break down if you consider that `1`, `2`, `3` etc. are also values of type `Integer`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Word8` etc. which are all distinct types (numeric literals are in fact polymorphic), but it kind of works if you pretend that only `Int` exists.)\n",
