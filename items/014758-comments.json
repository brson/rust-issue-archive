I mean, safe Rust doesn't allow the casting of pointers to `int`s anyway (e.g. `&T as int`). Maybe, there should be two unsized types: `int` and `intptr` (and their unsigned counterparts `uint` and `uintptr`). I disliked [the RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9940) replacing `int` with `intptr`, but the separation of integer-register-sized and pointer-sized `int`s could be a meaningful feature, especially for low-level code.\n",
