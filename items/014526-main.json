  "body": "An interface that gives a better control over the load factor and the minimum capacity for HashMap.\nThe size of `HashMap<K, V>` is now 64 bytes by default on a 64-bit platform (or at least 40 bytes, that is 3 words less, with FNV and without minimum capacity)\n\nUnanswered questions about `ResizePolicy`\n- should it control the `INITIAL_CAPACITY`?\n- should it fully control the resizing behavior? Even though the capacity always changes by a factor of 2.\n- is caching `grow_at` desirable?\n\nspecial thanks to @eddyb and @pnkfelix\n",
