    "body": "I'm having second thoughts about my chosen solution here. It's certainly safe but it's overly broad I suspect. Probably the best thing would be to consider \"object safety\" to be a function not of a trait in the abstract but of a particular instantiation of a trait in a given context. So in that case a supertrait reference like `Baz<Self>` would be illegal iff it resulted in a method that takes an argument of type `Self` (unless e.g. that method requires `Sized`, at least once RFC rust-lang/rfcs#817 is implemented). I was just a bit too lazy to code that up and I couldn't come up with any purpose for a trait type parameter but to appear in the interface, which seemed like it would always yield an error -- but I hadn't thought about the interactions with rust-lang/rfcs#817 and now I'm thinking maybe it's worth the effort.\n",
