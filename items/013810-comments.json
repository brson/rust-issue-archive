    "body": "Just ran into the same issue. After some digging I've found that `configure` sets `CFG_LIBDIR` to `$PREFIX/lib` on Linux and `$PREFIX/bin` on mingw32. See the `make install` output at the bottom of the post. `install.sh` has a number of locations that assume `$PREFIX/lib` including line 387. I'll see about submitting a pull request that removes these assumptions.\n\nI'm not sure what should be done about the `/usr` error. Should this be considered a MSYS setup issue? This is the default directory if configure is run without prefix. I also saw the double slashes. These have no affect on the path, and in my case were caused by running `configure --prefix=.../dest/dir/` -- the trailing slash is added by MSYS' tab completition and isn't expected or stripped out by `configure`.\n\nLinux, note liblibc-*.so directory:\n\n```\ncfg: build triple x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\ncfg: host triples x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\ncfg: target triples x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\ncfg: enabling more debugging (CFG_ENABLE_DEBUG)\ncfg: host for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is x86_64\ncfg: os for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is unknown-linux-gnu\ncfg: using gcc\ncfg: no pdflatex found, deferring to xelatex\ncfg: no xelatex found, deferring to lualatex\ncfg: no lualatex found, disabling LaTeX docs\ncfg: no pandoc found, omitting PDF and EPUB docs\ncfg: no llnextgen found, omitting grammar-verification\ncfg: including prepare rules\ncfg: including dist rules\ncfg: including install rules\ncleaning destination tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nprepare: tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin\nprepare: tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib\nprepare: tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/share/man/man1\nprepare: tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/liblibc-*.so\n...\n```\n\nmingw32,  note libc-*.dll directory:\n\n```\ncfg: build triple i686-pc-mingw32\ncfg: host triples i686-pc-mingw32\ncfg: target triples i686-pc-mingw32\ncfg: enabling more debugging (CFG_ENABLE_DEBUG)\ncfg: host for i686-pc-mingw32 is i386\ncfg: os for i686-pc-mingw32 is pc-mingw32\ncfg: using gcc\ncfg: disabling valgrind due to its unreliability on this platform\ncfg: no pdflatex found, deferring to xelatex\ncfg: no xelatex found, deferring to lualatex\ncfg: no lualatex found, disabling LaTeX docs\ncfg: no pandoc found, omitting PDF and EPUB docs\ncfg: no llnextgen found, omitting grammar-verification\ncfg: including prepare rules\ncfg: including dist rules\ncfg: including install rules\ncleaning destination tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-i686-pc-mingw32\nprepare: tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-i686-pc-mingw32/bin\nprepare: tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-i686-pc-mingw32/bin\nprepare: tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-i686-pc-mingw32/share/man/man1\nprepare: tmp/dist/rust-0.11.0-pre-i686-pc-mingw32/bin/libc-*.dll\n...\n```\n",

    "body": "I'm assuming that per https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14284 fixing [this one line](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/etc/install.sh#L387) solves this entire issue.\n\nUnfortunately the subtleties here are pretty deep. The solution proposed in #14284 makes several assumptions about relative paths that don't hold: all path-related options `configure/install.sh` may be either relative to `cwd` or absolute.\n\nThe root of the issue is that on windows we don't use a `lib` directory, but stuff everything into `bin`. The reason we do this is to hack around Window's lack of options for locating dynamic libs at runtime.\n\nI _think_ I prefer to continue using this strategy of having a different filesystem layout on windows, though we may also be able to just add more to the `$PATH` variable at install time to make this entire difference go away.\n\nIn any case, I would like to purge this difference in layouts from the build process, and defer the decision on where to put various artifacts until install-time. So, when we produce our dist artefacts, they have the same internal layout on all platforms, and the build system is less complex. _Doing that would solve this issue_ since then the manifest would be at the same location on all platforms.\n\nIf we do that then we have some options: since this installer is explicitly for Unixy systems (here msys), we _may not need to mess with --libdir at all_, if msys has previously set up the paths correctly to dynamically load libs from `/usr/local/lib`.\n\nNote that overriding `--libdir` is super-prone to utter breakage, both at compile time - when locating crates, and also at runtime - when dynamically loading libraries.\n\nAfter writing all this I'm more convinced that the right solution is to remove this hacky difference in filesystem layout completely.\n\n**In the meantime though** I am not opposed to copying some of the platform-detection code from `configure` to `install.sh` and special-casing mingw to look in `$prefix/bin` for the install manifest.\n",
