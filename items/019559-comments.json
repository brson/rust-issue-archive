I've seen discussion in a few other issues/RFCs that pulling in some specific combination of crates shouldn't mysteriously break code which worked previously, so I think this is something to consider. Of course, if you can prove that `S` is not visible outside the current crate, it should be possible to determine that there is only one resolution for the type `S::U`.\n",

It's unclear that there are any significant wins, especially since this feature would make it more confusing to see `T::U`: T could now be anything (struct, enum, union, or trait) and to find `U` you have to look through all of `T`'s impls, which seems unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThis works already with bounds that clear up ambiguity, as below:\r\n```rust\r\nstruct T;\r\n\r\ntrait A {\r\n    type Type;\r\n    fn create(&self) -> Self::Type;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl A for T {\r\n    type Type = i32;\r\n    fn create(&self) -> Self::Type {\r\n        10\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn t<X: A>(x: X) -> X::Type {\r\n    x.create()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {}\r\n```",
