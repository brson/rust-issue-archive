    "body": "Thanks, the tutorial shouldn't be mentioning exchange/local heap at all because it's easier to just say `Owned` things are sendable. It's not actually accurate that unique pointers/vectors are allocated on the exchange heap, since that's only true if they don't contain managed pointers.\n\nIt might make sense to talk about this in the language reference but... it would make even more sense to treat it as an implementation detail, covered in a separate implementation document.\n",
