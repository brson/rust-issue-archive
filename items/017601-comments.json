    "body": "> The benefit of this is that there is no more need for allocations\n\nI was under the impression that using `Select` did not require any allocations, could you point me to the point where something was allocated?\n\n> no more need for unsafe code\n\nThis is a bit of an interesting pro because none of the usage of the _macro_ previously had any unsafe code, only when you used the `Select` struct itself. It seems that this keeps the status quo (no unsafe code in macros), except it removes `Select`.\n\n> and no setup costs\n\nOut of curiosity, have you measured this? The only setup cost was designed to be maintenance of a simple linked list, which I wouldn't expect to have any lasting impact.\n\n---\n\nI definitely agree that `Select` is not the best structure in the world, I'm sad that it ended up having an `unsafe` interface, and I've always wanted to improve it! That being said, it has some concrete advantages over a purely macro-based system:\n- The setup cost of the macro is still nonzero. Attempting to select on a channel involves a few atomics to register yourself as available for selection. The `Select` structure allowed to you bring this cost up front and then select in a loop, whereas only using `select!` means you have to re-register yourself as interested each iteration of the loop.\n- The `Select` structure allowed for programmatic control over what's being selected over. As mentioned by @jdm, it looks like servo is already doing this and I think this can be important rather than requiring you to always statically know the set of channels that need to be selected over.\n\nIt seems like #12902 is largely just about the macro rather than the `Select` struct itself. Would it be possible to tweak the macro syntax (as done here) and not remove the `Select` structure?\n",
