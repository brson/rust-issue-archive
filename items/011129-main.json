  "body": "[On 2013-12-06, I wrote to the rust-dev mailing list](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-December/007263.html):\n\n> Subject: Let\u2019s avoid having both foo() and foo_opt()\n> \n> We have some functions and methods such as [std::str::from_utf8](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/str/fn.from_utf8.html) that may succeed and give a result, or fail when the input is invalid.\n> 1. Sometimes we assume the input is valid and don\u2019t want to deal with the error case. Task failure works nicely.\n> 2. Sometimes we do want to do something different on invalid input, so returning an `Option<T>` works best.\n> \n> And so we end up with both `from_utf8` and `from_utf8`. This particular case is worse because we also have `from_utf8_owned` and `from_utf8_owned_opt`, to cover everything.\n> \n> Multiplying names like this is just not good design. I\u2019d like to reduce this pattern.\n> \n> Getting behavior 1. when you have 2. is easy: just call `.unwrap()` on the Option. I think we should rename every `foo_opt()` function or method to just `foo`, remove the old `foo()` behavior, and tell people (through documentation) to use `foo().unwrap()` if they want it back?\n> \n> The downsides are that unwrap is more verbose and gives less helpful error messages on task failure. But I think it\u2019s worth it.\n\nThe email discussion has gone around long enough. Let\u2019s discuss a concrete proposal. For the following functions or methods, I removed `foo` (that caused task failure) and renamed `foo_opt` (that returns `Option`) to just `foo`.\n\nVector methods:\n- `get_opt` (rename only, `get` did not exist as it would have been just `[]`)\n- `head_opt`\n- `last_opt`\n- `pop_opt`\n- `shift_opt`\n- `remove_opt`\n\n`std::path::BytesContainer` method:\n- `container_as_str_opt`\n\n`std::str` functions:\n- `from_utf8_opt`\n- `from_utf8_owned_opt` (also remove the now unused `not_utf8` condition)\n\nIs there something else that should recieve the same treatement?\n\nI did not rename `recv_opt` on channels based on @brson\u2019s [feedback](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-December/007270.html).\n\nFeel free to pick only some of these commits.\n",
