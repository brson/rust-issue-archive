    "body": "My best guess, reading its syslog, is that it's simply _going to sleep_ due to power-idle status. I'm `pmset`'ing it to not sleep now, see how that goes.\n\nAsks the question: why is `mac2` not sleeping? Now we get a possibly sad story. In _its_ syslog, there is only one entry repeated every 5 seconds for eternity. It keeps associating and disassociating with a bluetooth mouse called `moco mouse` that is, presumably, sitting near the machine. So I think this is possibly having the affect of making the machine think someone is permanently sitting there wiggling the mouse.\n\nPoor thing.\n\nI'll keep fiddling with this. If I figure anything out, might ask someone in IT to move the mouse away.\n",
