    "body": "@apoelstra @reem\n\nPersonally I think this request is RFC-worthy and a function composition operator can be considered once unboxed closures are stabilized. (Though I am not sure if Rust needs a dedicated operator for that, as Haskell's \u201cmulti-arity\u201d functions are all effectively unary, but Rust's are not.)\n\nI don't like unifying both _string concatenation_ and _function composition_ under the same `Compose` trait. They are not the same thing after all. Especially, what does it mean to \"compose\" two strings?\n\nI propose that we add two traits, `Concat`, which desugars to `++`, and `Compose`, which desugars to `+.`. (Haskell special-cases `.`, while I'm fine with that, I don't expect Rust to do the same.)\n",
