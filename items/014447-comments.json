In regards to if `reserve_additional()` should be wrapping `reserve()`, I think how I'm doing it is correct. This is the same semantics as `Vec::reserve_additional()`, where `reserve_additional` is just doing a overflow-checked version of `v.reserve(v.len() + extra)`, so it makes since that the `minimum_capacity` would be changed here. If you want to resize a `HashMap` without changing the `minimum_capacity`, then I feel that should probably be a different name than `.reserve_*` prefix.\n",

I suppose we could change things around where `.reserve()`/`.reserve_additional()` don't touch `minimum_capacity`, and `.resize`/`.resize_additional()` do touch it, it's still convenient in both cases to have a `*_additional()` method variant.

    "body": "I think `reserve_additional()` makes sense if we change the semantics of `reserve()`, but I think with the current semantics of `reserve()`, having `reserve_additional()` gives the wrong impression of what the method is for. Because it's not for telling the `HashMap` that you're about to add 17 new elements (because telling the `HashMap` that doesn't tell it anything about the expected average usage over the lifetime of the `HashMap`).\n\nGiven that, I would feel more comfortable removing `reserve_additional()` from this PR and instead having a separate PR that changes the name of `reserve()` to something that indicates it's for setting the minimum capacity. Then a new `reserve()` can be written that really just ensures the current capacity is large enough, and `reserve_additional()` then makes sense in light of that.\n",
