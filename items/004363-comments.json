    "body": "Interesting.  I hadn't thought about this possibility for infinite type generation, though it seems obvious in retrospect.  @catamorphism I'm not sure what the best rule is.  I think the type is both instantiable and representable as is (considering each type independently, the size of any given type is computable for a given `A`).  This is more of a `monomorphizable` criterion.  There is a similar problem in function generation that we address by enforcing a maximum expansion depth in trans (which I've never been happy with, partly because I feel trans ought to be infallible).  Still, it is rather tricky to summarize the correct criteria.  If I understand it correctly, I think the one you proposed is too strict.\n\nConsider something like:\n\n```\nstruct A<T> {\n    b: @B<T>\n}\nstruct B<T> {\n    a: @A<int>,\n    b: @A<T>\n}\n```\n\nIgnoring the question of instantiability, which can be addressed by adding some `Option<>` types, I feel like this ought to be legal.  And yet `B` does not use `A` monomorphically.  It seems like the rule is that when `A<B...Z>` transitively includes a reference to a type `A<B'...Z'>`, for each type parameter `T in B...Z and T' in B'...Z'` either `T=T'` or `T` does not include `T'`.  I think this is the correct rule, but I would want to try and prove it.  The basic idea is that the only way to generate an infinite type expansion is to keep building compound types that include the input types.  It feels like there is a simple inductive argument that can make this case.\n\nI would like to replace the trans check with a similar test.  I remember trying to think of a good rule for trans and getting frustrated because any rule I came up with amounted to tracing the call graph in a fairly complex and deep way---basically redoing the work trans was already doing.  The simplest thing of course for this case would be to do what trans does: expand the type and keep a set of types we've seen.  If the recursion depth ever grows too high then we abort.  \n\nAs for the annoyance of having three distinct admission tests for types, I hear you.  I was already annoyed that there seemed to be a need for two such tests.  But they all test different things and I don't see an obvious way to combine them.\n",
