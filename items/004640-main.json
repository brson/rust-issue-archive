  "body": "...s.\n\n\"Dual impls\" are impls that are both type implementations and trait\nimplementations. They can lead to ambiguity and so this patch removes them\nfrom the language.\n\nThis also enforces coherence rules. Without this patch, records can implement\ntraits not defined in the current crate. This patch fixes this, and updates\nall of rustc to adhere to the new enforcement. Most of this patch is fixing\nrustc to obey the coherence rules, which involves converting a bunch of records\nto structs.\n\nr? @brson\n",
