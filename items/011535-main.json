  "body": "Unique pointers and vectors currently contain a reference counting\nheader when containing a managed pointer.\n\nThis `{ ref_count, type_desc, prev, next }` header is not necessary and\nnot a sensible foundation for tracing. It adds needless complexity to\nlibrary code and is responsible for breakage in places where the branch\n has been left out.\n\nThe `borrow_offset` field can now be removed from `TyDesc` along with\nthe associated handling in the compiler.\n\nCloses #9510\nCloses #11533\n",
