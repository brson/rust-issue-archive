    "body": "This is a little tricky. The \"second\" page it creates is arguably the one in `std`. And since rustdoc has only a single-crate view of the world, when it's creating the `collections` docs it can't know that the module in `collections` is going to be re-exported in `std`.\n\nA couple possible solutions:\n1. Move the `slice` and `array` primitive docs into their own modules in `std` and/or `core`. That seems reasonable to me.\n2. Pass a (possibly undocumented/unstable) flag to rustdoc to indicate whether to generate primitive pages or not.\n",
