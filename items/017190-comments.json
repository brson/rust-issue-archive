    "body": "In C++, container initialization looks like `std::vector<int> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` or `std::map<std::string, int> {{\"foo\", 3}, {\"bar\", 5}}` where the brace enclosed elements are a `std::initializer_list<T>` likely represented as `(ptr, len)`. Rust does have slices, but lacks a way to move from them. In theory, `&move T` (a linear type - it _must_ be moved from) could exist and `&move [T]` would cover this use case well.\n\nIt's very ugly to have a special cased macro for a type like `Vec<T>`, and I don't think it's possible to explain why it is that way beyond admitting that C++ handles this better and Rust may provide a better way of doing it in the future. In C though, people _do_ use macros for basic stuff like emulating generics. GLib is one example of a library making extensive use of macros like this.\n\nString formatting has to use macros because Rust doesn't have CTFE and variadic generics. Rust doesn't have comparable metaprogramming capabilities to C++ and D at a type system level.\n\nMacros are used to work around language limitations, and although Rust's macros are less ugly and less crippled (explicit at the call site, hygienic, pattern matching on tokens or fully procedural) it isn't a good thing that the language needs macros for things like this.\n",

You'll learn more when we talk about macros later.\n\n... but that pr didn't answer this issue's question -- Why `println!` was implemented as a macro (instead a function)? -- (so this issue should keep open?) ~~(and i don't think macro is a 'very advanced' topic.)~~\n\nNow I (Liigo, a rust newbie) will try to answer: \n\n> Rust doesn't has builtin variadic function support currently, so `println!` (or `vec!` etc.) can't be implemented as a function. We do have variadic macro, so it's a macro. (On one hand, It was considered that has variadic function support will make the language more complex. On the other hand, variadic macro can be implemented out of language, in std.)\n\nFeel free to correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks!\n\nEdit: no two years delay.\nEdit2: didn't get official answered for almost two years. If we can't put an answer into the book, maybe put it into FAQ?\nEdit3:\n",

I'll of course assume you didn't mean to leave such a criticism since @steveklabnik has been doing a lot. :+1: \n\nAbout the heart of your comment though: I see your point, I totally feel what you're getting at. The remark about macros that @steveklabnik made there leaves me, you and I guess many enthusiastic readers rather unsatisfied. \n\nI like the simplicity of your rephrasing, especially the unparenthesized part (the first two sentences). One note: your English grammar wasn't fully correct yet. \n\nI think the basic improvement suggestion for @steveklabnik and other documentation authors would be: _don't write something is just too advanced or will be addressed elsewhere without elaboration_.\n",
