    "body": "@marijnh It does generalize export globs, yes. That's more or less how I've modified the resolve pass to treat export globs anyways. Merged the glob-specifying AST nodes and just treats an export glob as \"an import of the same kind that happens to re-export its target\".\n\nI'm not _completely_ in favour of this, but partly. It's similar to how I did things at first; I changed to the current system for these reasons:\n- Having all the exports listed in one place makes life easier on the reader visiting a module, figuring out what it does, looking for a summary of its interface. Yes, rustdoc can make a synopsis, but readers-in-emacs need to scan around for the entries marked `pub`.\n- Having all the exports listed in one place makes life easier for the module-author to think over what's being exported from a module \"as an interface\" and judge whether it's an appropriate set, has missing parts, has overlaps, has inconsistent naming, etc.\n- Writing `pub` as a qualifier at the definition site makes definition sites chattier. When you mention Java's verbosity one of the first phrases on people's lips is `public static void main` . So I've been shy about qualifier-bloat, particularly one that's mandatory or really common. `pub fn main() { ... }` is not so bad, but it's a step in that direction.\n\nI realize these are in direct tension with the desire to avoid flipping up-and-down between definitions and export lists though. So I'm just .. curious if there's some way to relieve that tension.\n\nSome languages \"solve\" this by using sectioning directives within definition scopes. That is, the way C++ members are organized into any number of `public:` and `private:` sections. Ada does something similar inside its packages (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming/Packages). I wonder if there's something worth exploring in there?\n\nAs an aside, I think if we make this change we should bundle it with two other changes:\n- Change `use` to mean what `import` currently means, and rename `use` to `link`. Because `use` and `import` are too similar, and people don't really gather by looking that `use` means \"link in this external crate\"\n- Make the default no-qualifier status mean _crate-local_ visibility (like `package` in java), make `pub` mean \"exported from crate\", and `priv` mean \"private to this module and its inner scopes\".\n",
