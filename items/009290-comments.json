    "body": "I believe that this is intended behavior. If you attempt to compile\n\n```\nSome(~\"1.45\").and_then(from_str)\n```\n\nThen what rustc would have to do is to insert a shim between the two which does the auto-deref for you. I would be very surprised for a compiler to do that when I didn't ask it to. If you write a closure `|s| from_str(s)` then you're explicitly asking the compiler to create a function, and then inside that function the auto-ref/auto-deref will work just fine.\n\nI would be in favor of closing this as wontfix, but others may feel differently.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton How is that different than normal autoslice? The compiler also needs to add code that does the coercion here: `from_str::<f64>(~\"1.4\")`.\n\nWould it be so bad if the compiler would add an inlined zero cost shim for those examples above?\n\nIn my opinion, every supported automatic coercion should be supported in all cases, or else it becomes confusing.\n",
