The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "So, I'm going to take a stand and say that I do not want to type `ast::Item_::Foo`. I think the usual convention in this situation is to rename `Item_` to `ItemKind` (and probably rename the `node` field to `kind`), which is sort of the opposite of what @eddyb suggested. It has the downside that one must write `ast::ItemKind::Foo`, which is long, but the upside that the \"main type\" is `ast::Item` and that you access `item.kind` to get a value of type `ItemKind` (whereas in @eddyb's proposal you access `item.node` to get a value of type `Item`). I could go either way on which renaming we do, but I think if we're going to change to use namespace'd variants for `Item` and friends, we should rename at the same time.\n",
