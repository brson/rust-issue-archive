    "body": "Pushed in 9fed56ed9035912a2657b07ab1b7671706bd9576\n\n@graydon---I thought for a while if we could make this change unnecessary.  It would be nice if node-ids were always internal and def-ids were always external.  It could perhaps be achieved with some refactoring.  We could remove the def-ids from parameters, for example, but I was reluctant to do that because it is useful.  For example, if we're ever going to correct the print outs for type parameters to not print `'a` but rather the name the user gave, we'll need the def-id or something!  Anyway, pushed for now, but maybe we can refactor later to be cleaner.\n",
