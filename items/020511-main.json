  "body": "`#[deriving]` has been changed to `#[derive]`, so we should update this lint accordingly so that it remains consistent with the language.\n\nAlso register the rename with the LintStore.\n\nI've changed the one reference to `raw_pointer_deriving` that occurs in the tests (as well as renamed the file appropriately), but the rest of the `raw_pointer_deriving`s in the Rust codebase will need to wait for a snapshot to be changed because stage0 doesn't know about the new lint name.  I'll take care of the remaining renaming after the next snapshot.\n\nCloses #20498.\n",
