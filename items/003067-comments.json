    "body": "The problem here is that the loan is issued for the entire block.  We could improve the error message if borrow check would note the \"last uses\" that it canceled (and, presumably, the loan that caused it to do so).  Then the kind checker could report \"this would be a last use, but for the loan issued on line foo, trying enclosing it in a block\".\n",
