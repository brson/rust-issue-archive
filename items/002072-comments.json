My first inclination was \"keep the size down by doing highlighting in JavaScript\", but then I realised that we can do it better otherwise (JavaScript could still be used if desired which could lead to smaller files; the advisability of that can be considered later); we could even annotate it with cross-references to and fro, hither and yon, making it _really_ useful.\n\nBear in mind, however, that it is possible that someone may not wish to reveal the source if they are writing a closed-source crate but still want docs.
