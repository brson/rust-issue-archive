    "body": "So, I had this crazy idea involving `bind` that would allow us to create tasks with all kinds of options in a very flexible way.  I tried implementing it and found it was elegant in theory but a horrible mess in practice.  Therefore, I was thinking that something simple would work better.\n\nFor example, a base task API that takes an options struct along with a unique closure:\n\n```\nenum task = uint;\nfn defaults() -> opts;\nfn spawn(opts: opts, body: fn~()) -> task;\n```\n\nthen we can have a couple of other modules encapsulating common patterns.  For example an `actor` module that creates a task with its own mailbox so that others can send messages to it, or a `future` module that creates a task that computes a result.  I elaborated out those two examples in [a blog post](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/02/13/task-api/) so I won't repeat it here.\n\nThis isn't so different from what we have now, I guess, just a bit better organized. Is it too simple, or workable?\n",
