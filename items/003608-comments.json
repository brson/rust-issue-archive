    "body": "I don't think we strictly need any attributes to disable stack growth, since we can just flip some bits at runtime to make stack growth not happen, but omitting the stack growth function prologue would be a potentially significant optimization.\n\nWhat this most depends on is changing the way extern fns are declared and implemented so that we can separate the generation of Rust-ABI wrapper functions from the generation of C-ABI functions.\n\nBeyond that we need to make sure that the failure modes are consistent (`abort()`) when calling existing runtime functions when the task pointer is not available. Then you can start writing Rust functions that do not depend on the runtime.\n\nAdditional related stuff:\n- The compiler may need to insert a little bit of assembly before main to zero out the stack limit\n- Merge 'rt' calls in core with 'lang_items' #3476\n- Convert all upcalls except those on the stack growth path to lang items #2861\n- Create a clearly delineated runtime API (right now the points of interaction between generated code and core/rt are scattered everywhere), probably all in core::rt, definitions that logically belong somewhere else can be reexported\n- Create a little template that is independent of core to help implement the API the compiler expects\n- Make the compiler use the runtime API lazily so that unimplemented lang_items don't generate compile time failures\n- Split out major pieces of runtime functionality into reusable components, specifically for stack growth, task scheduling, and memory management.\n",

    "body": "I think it might be useful to have @ boxes degrade to refcounting (without cycle detection) in runtime-less mode, since they're a language feature. I think it would make it much easier to write code portable between runtime and runtime-less Rust if one can rely on all language features being there.\n\nTasks on the other hand are presented as a library, so their absence in something explicitly called runtime-less would be a lot less surprising. I don't know if it would be possible to have tasks degrade to posix threads, since their semantics are different and it may just be confusing.\n",

    "body": "It is **not** clear how to build freestanding binaries, with `zero.rs` or otherwise.\n\n`zero.rs` itself lacks build instructions and has a standing issue https://github.com/pcwalton/zero.rs/issues/6 on this matter. It also seems like it has fallen behind Rust development and became incompatible with current version of the language.\n\nThis very issue also has no instructions on using `zero.rs` (or even a hyperlink to it), nor does Rust Reference Manual contain any reference to the possibility of disabling the runtime, using `zero.rs`, or even to the \"no_std\" directive. Without any kind of documentation, \"runtime-less Rust\" cannot be considered done.\n\nAt the very least I feel that `zero.rs` should be merged with `rust`, be included in the language distribution and be updated alongside the language itself.\n",

    "body": "@Babazka, since `zero.rs` was implemented, it's not a feature that all `lang_item` constructs are optional. These used to be required and `zero.rs` basically provided a default or dummy implementation of all of them. Nowadays you can actually create a small hello-world program with just:\n\n``` rust\n#[no_std];\n\n#[start]\nfn main(_: int, _: **u8, _: *u8) -> int { 0 }\n```\n\nIt doesn't do a whole lot obviously, but it compiles and doesn't link to `libstd` or the runtime and it runs! It won't exactly work in all circumstances, but I actually do think that this issue should be reopened for a few reasons:\n1. @Babazka is right, this should be well-documented in _some_ location in what a \"runtime-less\" rust really is and how you can get it.\n2. Right now a \"runtimeless\" rust is still forced to link to `librustrt` because of the invocations of the `__morestack` call. Should we allow disabling of segmented stacks to prevent this? Or should we allow `__morestack` to perform a stack check as opposed to a stack growth to prevent stack overflow. Or should we have both in some combination?\n3. Things like `Option` and `Either` are pretty ubiquitous, so could we build `libstd` with something like `--cfg noruntime`? This would allow a `libstd` which has 0 dependencies on the runtime, but it still provides all the useful functions of things like intrinsics, slices, normal types, etc.\n\nAt this point though, rust is pretty close to being able to run with \"no runtime\", so it may be a proper time to start opening sub-issues instead of lumping everything into one issue. Until that point though, I'm going to reopen because I agree that this isn't 100% done yet.\n",
