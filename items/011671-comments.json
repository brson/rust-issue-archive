    "body": "Okay this is not as easily fixable as I thought. But there's a doable (and IMO clean) solution:\n\nReadd what I had in my first version of #11045:\n\n```\nif [[ \"$CFG_LIBDIR\" != \"$CFG_PREFIX\"* ]]\nthen\n    err \"libdir must begin with the prefix. Use --prefix to set it accordingly.\"\nfi\n\nvalopt libdir-relative \"${CFG_LIBDIR:${#CFG_PREFIX}+1}\" \"install libraries (relative to prefix\"\n```\n\nProbably don't make CFG_LIBDIR_RELATIVE configurable, but still calculate it from CFG_LIBDIR. Then add linker flags to target.mk like it was here: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/commit/89f8bc2561dfae51affa47a5056c065091c49f51\n\nBefore I create a PR with these two changes, I would want to know if this would get merged. @alexcrichton what are your thoughts on this?\n",

As in current state CFG_LIBDIR makes no sense: when it is set and rust is installed, it can not compile any create because of \n\n```\nerror: can't find crate for `std`\n```\n\nand this error is because rustc looks in hardcoded relative path.\n\nHave I missed something or --libdir option is broken at the moment?\n",
