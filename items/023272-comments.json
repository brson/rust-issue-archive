    "body": "In general this starts breaching into the async I/O territory as what you probably \"really want to do\" is wait on some form of pipe plus a UDP socket and then send something on the pipe to have the call be unblocked. It looks like the OS-provided `shutdown` isn't always what we want, so there's no direct analog for supporting this, and as such it would require quite a bit of extra infrastructure.\n\nAs a result, I'm going to close this and add its use case to https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/957 instead. Thanks for the issue though!\n",
