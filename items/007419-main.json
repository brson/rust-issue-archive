  "body": "r? @brson `rustpkg build`, if executed in a package source directory inside\na workspace, will now build that package. By \"inside a workspace\"\nI mean that the parent directory has to be called `src`, and rustpkg\nwill create a `build` directory in .. if there isn't already one.\n\nSame goes for `rustpkg install` and `rustpkg clean`.\n\nFor the time being, `rustpkg build` (etc.) will still error out if\nyou run it inside a directory whose parent isn't called `src`.\nI'm not sure whether or not it's desirable to have it do something\nin a non-workspace directory.\n",
