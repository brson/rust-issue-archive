    "body": "This is not a problem isolated to `Deref`: \n\nBecause of the auto(de)ref behavior of dot, you can get in this situation in plenty different ways. Prominent example: `Clone` is implemented for `&T` to return `&T`, independent of any type that might implement `Clone` for `T`.\n\nWhile implementors of `Deref` should definitely be careful to not make the API to confusing, restricting it to only types that don't have a public method/field APIs to restrictive.\n\nFuture example: With DST, Vec<T> will implement `Deref<[T]>`, to make slicing it easy. This is definitely a case where the limitation spoken of here would not be useful.\n",
