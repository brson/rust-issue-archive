Oversafety is less of a problem than inability to express immutable circular references.\n\nIt would be nice if we explicitly stated in docs that the reason to use uninit is to convince the compiler that a variable has been initialized without actually doing the work to initialize it (which is, of course, unsafe in general, unlike the suggested feature).\n",
