    "body": "We now have the capability to fix it, yes, but I'm not yet sure of the optimal organization. Having subdirectories is good but I've often found also that there are tests which span categories. Using `foo-bar-baz` names allowed me to handle that by having both categories in the name. Nonetheless, it seems obvious that we could start by making directories for the existing groupings, like `regions-*` or whatever.\n\nLonger term I have a strong desire to have things organized such that we can easily answer the question \"is there a test covering this scenario\"? As far as I am concerned, our test-base right now is effectively \"write only\". This is however a very challenging problem -- and not one we will be to answer with just file names and directory conventions.\n\nAnyway, a couple of thoughts:\n1. I think it is generally speaking **wrong** to have test structure match the compiler's structure. That is, I wouldn't want to have to move tests around just because we made a new crate or something.\n2. But having directories for \"major passes\" in the compiler makes sense to me (privacyck, typeck, borrowck, etc).\n3. We should probably move all the `issue-123` tests into a `regression` directory.\n4. Only mildly related, but I'd like to merge run-pass and compile-fail into one concept someday. :)\n",
