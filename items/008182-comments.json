    "body": "Yeah, I\"m having a hard time with the quantity of machinery here too. Especially the new metadata and expression parts. Is this all because you're trying to support user-extensible formating operator names (eg. `fmt!(\"{z}\", thing)` where \"z\" is previously not-known to `fmt!`)? If so I think it might be overgeneralizing -- the set of format _traits_ is probably small enough (and sufficiently prone to collision -- global flat namespace favoring short names!) that I think we can manually curate the list in `libstd`, or the `fmt` extension itself. I figured we'd keep that lit small-ish and assume that most of the time when users want to customize formatting, they want to do so by implementing an existing formatting-trait, not defining a whole new one.\n",
