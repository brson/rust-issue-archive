It's straightforward enough to use an item macro that takes in an item for each type-specific chunk to combine with the generic code, but it seems necessary to make these declarations in `core.rc` rather than declaring the modules in external files as it is now.\n\nIs this expected or is there a different approach here that I'm missing?\n",

    "body": "I had a working patch on master, but upon grabbing incoming I hit resolve errors that I assume are due to the crate-relative `use` change in tandem with using the workaround for macros expanding to >1 item (issue #3086 [comment #4](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/3086#issuecomment-7826309)).\n\n#### Implementation\n\n``` rust\n// core.rc\n\n...\n\n// FIXME(#3114): Macro import/export.\nfn macros() { include!(\"integer-templates.rs\"); }\n\n/* Primitive types */\n\n// pub mod i8 { int_template!(i8, 8) } // what it'll look like w/o temporary workaround below\n\npub mod i8  {\n    int_template!(i8, 8) // accepts type and number of bits\n    pub use i8::inst::*;\n}\n...\n```\n\n``` rust\n// integer-templates.rs\n{\n\nmacro_rules! int_template (\n\n  ($typ:ty, $bits:expr) => {\n\n    pub mod inst { // FIXME(#3086): Macro expansion to multiple items\n\n      use char;\n      use cmp;\n      use cmp::{Eq, Ord};\n      use from_str::FromStr;\n      use iter;\n      use num;\n      use num::Num::from_int;\n      use str;\n      use uint;\n      use vec;\n\n      pub type T = $typ;\n      pub const bits  : uint = $bits;\n      pub const bytes : uint = (bits / 8);\n\n      // rest of int-template.rs code\n    }\n  }\n)\n\nmacro_rules! uint_template (\n  // etc\n)\n\n}\n```\n\nI re-export at the end of each module to work around the workaround for multiple item expansion (extra module `mod inst` full of those items). The `int_template!` macro is simply a wrapper around the existing int-template.rs file and a merge of the other signed integer type files since there's nothing type specific. Similarly, there's a `uint_template!` macro doing the same for uint-template.rs and unsigned integer type files (except u8's `is_ascii`). \n\nAside: Another macro could be created to encapsulate what's common to both macros, but I'm not sure if that helps or hurts readability (yo dawg, macro in a macro...).\n\n#### Issues\n\nThe compiler complains about not resolving the additional use declarations added in #4174 (`use char;`, `use cmp;`, etc). _Interestingly enough_, once those declarations are removed everything works...for the _first_ pass of the compiler (stage0), but **fails** at stage1 with resolve errors for the removed use declarations.\n\nI tried placing the use declarations with the module body in core.rc, and I got a different set of resolve errors (e.g., ::i8::to_str).\n\nI imagine there might be some `#[cfg]` magic that could be used, but I'm not familiar with the stages of the compiler.\n\nHow can I modify the use declarations and/or re-export correctly to solve these issues?\n\n(Happy New Year and sorry for the length; feel free to refer me to someone else if necessary!)\n",

    "body": "This should be more than possible after the next snapshot. Currently the stage0 compiler expands\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! a(\n  () => (pub mod a {\n    #[cfg(a)] pub fn foo() {}\n    #[cfg(b)] pub fn foo() {}\n  })\n)\n\na!()\n\nfn main() { a::foo(); }\n```\n\nto the `a` module having both definitions of `foo` (regardless of `--cfg` flags passed to rustc). This is fixed within the compiler, however (expansion happens much earlier in the compilation process). It's possible to do now, but it would be much less ugly after the next snapshot.\n\nThis is a problem because a few methods in the templates (the iterators) are `cfg`'d for different stages.\n",

    "body": "Well in the ideal world both those issues can be resolved, but I think that the main purpose of this bug is to remove the `#[merge]` hack which seems like more of an issue to me. With that in mind, macros can definitely used to implement these modules.\n\nI [started working on this](https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/commit/b136643cd8db5d3d9a71e5ce51e268a2a337379a) before I realized it was already taken. You can use the [`#[macro_escape]` attribute](https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/commit/b136643cd8db5d3d9a71e5ce51e268a2a337379a#L6R11) to \"export\" macros, so 3114 isn't completely necessary. Also, 4375 would be nice, but you can also just [have a private module](https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/commit/b136643cd8db5d3d9a71e5ce51e268a2a337379a#L6R13) and then in the actual module you just put `pub use generated::*` or something like that. The unfortunate part is that rustdoc becomes pretty useless, but there's open bugs for that as far as I know as well.\n\nI might take a stab at 4375 in the meantime, but I'll let you take over from here!\n",
