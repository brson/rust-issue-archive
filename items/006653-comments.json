    "body": "Hmm, it seems that because f is a stack closure, it is allowed to capture upvars pretty much without limit, because (it thinks) it can guarantee that the captured variables are valid for it's lifetime. Ideally, it should act as if the closure either has a mutable borrow, or that `a` has been moved. I'm tempted to lean towards the first option in this case, since it means that the end of `f` releases the borrow, thus allowing a to be used again.\n\nThis means that this code shouldn't compile, giving the same error message as:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n  let mut a = ~1;\n  let b = &mut *a;\n  a = ~2;\n}\n// error: cannot assign to `a` because it is borrowed\n```\n\nI'm nominating this for \"well defined\".\n",
