    "body": "So I've been putting some thought into this and I just want to write out the current state of my thinking. As @arielb1 pointed out, the problems here run a bit deeper than I originally considered. Basically, in a coherence like system, almost _any_ impl potentially imposes a kind of implicit negative constraint on the ancestor crates. Let me elaborate some of the scenarios.\n\nThe problems are related to the orphan rules. In particular, the orphan rules require that a local type appear _somewhere_ in the impl, but they don't require that local types \"cover\" remote types (so, e.g., `Box<LocalType>` is OK, even though the remote type `Box` is \"uncovered\"). (I'm defining \"cover\" to say that a type constructor covers the types used as its type parameters; so in the type `(X<Y>,Z)`, `X` covers `Y` but not `Z`.)\n\n### Hazards arising inherently from coherence\n\nBasically no matter what, there are _always_ forward evolution hazards, particularly if a crate attempts to add blanket impls for an existing trait. Imagine we have a crate A that defines `Trait` and a crate B that defines some type `Type`. Even the most local impl by B restricts how crate A can evolve:\n\n``` rust\nimpl A::Trait for B::Type { } // in crate B\n```\n\nThat impl prevents A from adding an impl like:\n\n``` rust\nimpl<T> A::Trait for T where .. { } // in crate A\n```\n\nThe only exception is when the new impl in A includes some where clause referencing a trait that is newly added in A and where we can be sure that downstream types do not yet implement this trait.\n\nSimilarly, because of how the orphan rules are structured, crate B might have impls like:\n\n``` rust\nimpl A::Trait for Box<B::Type> { } // in crate B\nimpl A::Trait for &B::Type { } // in crate B\n```\n\nNaturally these would prevent crate A from adding blanket impls like:\n\n```\nimpl<T> A::Trait for Box<T> { } // in crate A\nimpl<T> A::Trait for &T { } // in crate A\n```\n\n(The same proviso about where clauses referencing new traits applies.)\n\nNote that \"blanket\" impls do not have to be involving smart pointers. For example, a relevant example is that libstd might want to implement `Copy` for the range types in the future:\n\n``` rust\nimpl<T:Copy> Copy for Range<T> { }\n```\n\nUnfortunately, that could conflict if some downstream user had manually implemented `Copy` for ranges over their types:\n\n``` rust\nimpl Copy for Range<MyType> { }\n```\n\nSo basically the only thing that a crate can safely add is an impl with no generic type parameters in the local type:\n\n``` rust\nimpl Copy for SomeType { /* note: no generic type parameters at all! */ }\n```\n\n#### Mitigation strategies for the \"inherent\" conflicts of coherence\n\nOne interesting aspect of these conflicts is that they are always \"intra-trait\". What I mean is that you wind up with a coherence violation because the ancestor and children creates both provide an impl of the _same trait_. This implies that one way to address this might be some sort of specialization-based design. There are lots of design questions to address here, but the basic idea would be that the ancestor trait can add a \"low priority\" blanket impl that subcrates can override. This could be added even after other crates may have already created more specialized impls without creating a disturbance.\n\nIn the particular case of `Copy` and other marker traits, we might also consider looser coherence rules because there are no methods. But I think we'd want to be careful about how we do this, because if there is no opt-in, then people would be prevented from adding methods to empty traits, which is another extension vector we may (or may not) want to permit.\n\n### Hazards arising more specifically from negative reasoning\n\nThese hazards can arise somewhat indirectly as well, due to the negative reasoning that coherence uses. This was the issue I originally started talking about. For example, I might implement a trait like:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo { .. }\nimpl<T:Copy> Foo for T { .. }\nimpl<T:Copy> Foo for Range<T> { .. }\n```\n\nIn this case, `Range` is a type defined in `libstd` (and hence not local). For this set of impls to be legal, `Range<T>` must not impl `Copy`, or else those two impls would overlap. This implies that if libstd  tried to add `impl<T:Copy> Copy for Range<T>` in the future, we'd cause a downstream error. \n\n#### Mitigation strategies for negative bounds\n\nInterestingly, specialization doesn't help here. Whereas before the problem was that we created overlapping impls within a trait, in this case the problem is that growing a trait _at all_ induces overlapping impls for _another trait_. Specialization can help us resole the first problem -- which impl to use within the first trait -- but it doesn't help for the second case, because libstd cannot change the set of impls for the trait `Foo`.\n\nTo be clear, specialization _might_ help if we had some rules such that the impls on `Foo` were inherently prioritized, such that the impl for `Range<T>` took precedence over the one for `T` or vice versa; but this seems very dependent on the specialization design. That is, specialization _could_ allow the downstream crate to _protect itself_ against the hazard of `Range` becoming `Copy`, but it doesn't necessarily allow the _upstream_ crate to protect others, which is what we want.\n\n### Limiting negative reasoning\n\nMy initial proposal was to imply a sort of orphan-rule-like restriction on negative reasoning. The intuition is that you can apply negative reasoning to types in your own crate, but not upstream crates, because those upstream crates might grow. But the devil is in the details here. We presumably want to require that we can only rely on `T : !Trait` if either `T` or `Trait` is local, but just what does local mean for a type?\n\nIn particular, if use the definition from the orphan rules, then something like `Box<A::Type>` (or `Range<MyInt>`) is local, and then if the upstream crates attempts to add a blanket impl like `impl<T:Copy> Copy for Range<T>`, they will still create a conflict.\n\nIf we use a more stringent definition, say that all remote (or structural?) types must be covered by local types, then we definitely rule out patterns that are in use. The problem I encounter right now in libstd derives from the `alloc` crate:\n\n``` rust\nimpl<E> FromError<E> for E\nimpl<'a, E: Error + 'a> FromError<E> for Box<Error + 'a>\n```\n\nHere the problem is that the type `Error` is not local to `alloc`, and hence the predicate that `Error : !Sized` is not considered satisfied. It may be worth special-casing `Sized` just to see where it leaves us.\n",

    "body": "More investigation. I added a flag I can use to disable the check on particular impls so that I could keep going and uncover all potentially problematic combinations.\n\nHere is another example conflict, this time in `Iterator`:\n- `impl<'a, T> IntoIterator for &'a BinaryHeap<T> where T: Ord`\n- `impl<T> IntoIterator for T where T: Iterator`\n\nI believe this is considered a conflict because `&BinaryHeap` is not local (although `BinaryHeap` would be). This conflict could not be resolved by collapsing the facade, since we naturally expect users to define their own iterable types.\n\nIt _could_ be resolved by considering `&T` to be local if `T` is local, but this creates hazards (you cannot compatibly add a blanket impl for all `&T` -- which might be ok). Somewhat more annoying is that if we chose to use the full local rules, then `Foo<T>` would be local if `T` is local, which implies that we also could not add impls for any existing generic type `Foo<T>`, which feels less ok. \n\n**UPDATE:** To clarify, I wrote `&T` above, I meant it as a shorthand for `Smaht<T>` in some sense.\n",
