  "body": "The `FileStat` struct contained a `path` field, which was filled by the\n`stat` and `lstat` function. Since this field isn't in fact returned by\nthe operating system (it was copied from the paths passed to the\nfunctions) it was removed, as in the `fstat` case we aren't working with\na `Path`, but directly with a fd.\n\nIf your code used the `path` field of `FileStat` you will now have to\nmanually store the path passed to `stat` along with the returned struct.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
