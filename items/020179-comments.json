The RFC says that the original reason for the ordering restriction was due to the way shadowing was implemented (to make it more clear), but with shadowing now removed the semantics are clear not matter what order items are in.\n\nI'm not sure this is true for blocks though:\n\n``` rust\nlet foo = 3;\nuse bar::foo;\nprintln!(\"{}\", foo); // what does this print?\n```\n\nI think that lifting the restriction for items are fine, but due to our allowance of shadowing with local variables, I don't think we should lift the restriction in expressions.\n",
