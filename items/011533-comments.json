It was added as a form of future-proofing when it was assumed that a garbage collector would require it, as Graydon's did, but that's no longer the plan. It makes no sense to add a bunch of complexity to support something senseless that's going to be replaced very soon. Until a garbage collector is implemented, `Gc<T>` lacks a use case anyway.\n",

    "body": "I do not remember you writing any code that looks like this. You had a new `NonManaged` bound which explicitly disallowed this pattern. I don't recall anything which actually handled the case of pointers that have different structures. You may have alluded to it and talked about it, but you never put such code up for review once we agreed on what to do about weak pointers.\n\nThere may not be a reason to use `local_malloc`, but that's what we're living with today, so we have to deal with it. This is not \"a bunch of complexity\". This is two helper functions which are specially crafted (and then used everywhere) and then another special function used because the value is dropped before the box. The is the same dances that `local_data` did a long time ago.\n\nThere most certainly is a good reason to add this and it's memory safety! This is entirely memory unsafe if you're using a Gc in an Rc and attempting to get a reference to this. Our options are to add a `NonManaged` kind which is a huge amount more complexity than a few functions here or to fix it locally (like this).\n\nDepending on how Gc is updated in the future, this will have to stay in sync, but that's the point of regression tests.\n",

I also discovered some take glue issues along the way that are still present here but it's probably not specific to `Rc`.\n\n> There may not be a reason to use `local_malloc`, but that's what we're living with today, so we have to deal with it.\n\nIt wouldn't be hard to remove the code paths I added in the pull request removing the headers from some but not all unique boxes. That's the correct fix here since there's no way these headers are actually going to be used by the garbage collector and it adds a lot of extra code to `vec.rs`.\n\n> There most certainly is a good reason to add this and it's memory safety! This is entirely memory unsafe if you're using a Gc in an Rc and attempting to get a reference to this\n\nJust remove the `Gc<T>` stub I added or mark it as experimental. It's entirely useless and I only submitted it because `Rc<T>` used to have strict type bounds. It's going to mislead people into thinking a garbage collector is implemented and they can use it without worrying about reference cycles.\n\nIt's also memory-unsafe with the `shrink_to_fit` method as I reported a while ago and another dozen additional methods that I've kept track of. I could open an issue report for each one... or we could just remove the useless header code paths from librustc and the standard library.\n",

    "body": "This is better than the current situation, but it seems potentially problematic to drop a box with a different size, since the allocator could very well rely on knowing the allocation size on both alloc and free (for instance, larger allocations could be performed by directly calling mmap and munmap, and the size must be passed to munmap and adding an header could waste a whole page).\n\nThere is also another issue: tracing RcBox with an hypotetical tracing GC is currently broken, because the GC doesn't know whether the contents are alive or not and thus will either always or never trace them, which are both wrong.\n\nI think what ideally needs to be done is to have a \"StrongBox\" type that encapsulates the data and strong reference count, stores the data as an [u8, ..sizeof(T)] and manually implements tracing and dropping correctly, knowing that the data is only constructed if the reference count is != 0 (as well as providing try_borrow, try_add_ref, release, etc.)\n",
