    "body": "I'm confused as to what `?Sized` has to do with anything. The trait isn't object-safe because it references `Self`, not because `Self` has a compile-time size. In the compiler-synthesized `impl SpecialFnBox for SpecialFnBox`, what is it supposed to do? You have it taking an `X<SpecialFnBox>`, but it can't use that to call the `.do_boxed()` method of the underlying concrete value because that method takes an `X<Self>`, not an `X<SpecialFnBox>`. It can't convert the`X<SpecialFnBox>` to `X<Self>` because it may be a boxed object _of a different implementation_.\n\n**Edit:** @P1start beat me to the punch and said it in a better way.\n",
