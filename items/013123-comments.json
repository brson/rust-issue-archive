    "body": "> What are you expecting to happen?\n\nI was expecting the runtime to return some `Err()` upon requesting an action from a defunct process. I also tried polling the state of the defunct process using `signal(0)` (as mentioned in the [documentation](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/io/process/struct.Process.html#method.kill)), but this returned `Ok()` as well.\n\n> When you send a TERM signal to a process without a registered handler, it terminates promptly. The runtime currently doesn't register any TERM/INT handlers, that's up to you.\n\nEven if the runtime dosn't \"catch\" the SIG{TERM,INT}, is it not possible at all to `fail!()` or return `Err()` in any of the two cases mentioned above?\n",
