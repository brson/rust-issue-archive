So if you've installed 0.8 binary, you had to download such old dlls manually.\nIf you've installed rust from latest source, there should be no \"wrong dll\" issues. In the case, please leave a comment at #9252 so we can investigate it more :)\n",

Maybe create the `lib` folder as a symbolic link on Windows during the build? (Vista only, needs admin rights)\n",
