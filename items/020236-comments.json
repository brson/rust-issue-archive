I'd be fine with doing something more limited for now, as long as there's a clear migration path toward a more general version later.\n\nI don't really know much about the limitations of the syntax here. It'd be awesome, for example, to be able to write:\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(\n    #[stable] \n    #[cfg(test)]\n    Clone\n)]\n```\n",
