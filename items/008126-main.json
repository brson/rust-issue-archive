  "body": "The problem with issue #8002 and #6914 is that the `exec()` call fails after `fork()`. After the failure, the parent process does not know about the failure. The parent process hangs during the `waitpid()` call.\n\nI tried to use `pipe2` and `O_CLOEXEC` to check in the parent process if `exec()` succeeds after `fork()`.\n\nThis PR fixes the problem with `pandoc'. I tested this on the latest master revision.\n\n``` shell\n$ rustdoc --output-dir doc btree.rs\nrust: task failed at 'failure in execvp: errno=No such file or directory', /home/smvv/work/rust/rust/src/libstd/run.rs:689\n```\n\nHowever, there is still some work to do before it can be merged:\n- Code has a hardcoded `O_CLOEXEC` value. This should be derived from the C header file. What would be the approach to derive this properly? `O_CLOEXEC` is defined in: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open.html\n  It is also possible to use `fcntl()` to set `FD_CLOEXEC`, but the `fcntl` defined in libc.rs takes only two arguments instead of three.\n- Code uses `pipe2`, which is not defined in libc.rs. Should `pipe2` be added to libc.rs, or what would be the way to proceed here?\n- There are some comments in the patch about `false` being used in the FILE reader and writer constructor. I was not sure if it should use `false` or `true`.\n\nI read that `pipe2` is Linux-specific, but perhaps it is also available on other Unix platforms?\n",
