In theory it would be better to redirect them on renames but it's not going to be possible because it's not tracked.\n\nThe point of a canonical URL is to say that the page is only a non-canonical _version_ of another URL and shouldn't show up separate in search. When we eventually have supported versions, the newest release (or master) can be given as the canonical one so the older pages won't clutter search results but will be available via a drop-down menu.\n\nOf course, if the newer version _does not have the module_, you would have to omit stating it is the canonical URL - meaning you need to regenerate _the old documentation_ every time you do the new ones. I don't think it's worth the complexity.\n",

    "body": "When a module is _removed_, 404 is indeed correct, but just remember that that's not the end of the story, as I wrote recently about at http://chrismorgan.info/blog/github-links-case-study.html.\n\nWhat the Django docs do is worthwhile considering: https://docs.djangoproject.com/. It makes it easy to switch between versions and shows a warning banner for the development build suggesting you may want to look at the latest stable instead. They don't, however, have a banner reminding you \"this isn't the latest stable version\" for old versions, which continues to surprise me a little. I reckon old versions (though not before 1.0 after a while) should stay in existence but with a banner at the top indicating that this is an unsupported release, and docs for the latest version, X.Y, are available in such-and-such a place. Of course, these things become much more directly applicable once we get to 1.0 and beyond.\n\n@alexcrichton I guess in the no-longer-exists case you'd need to either implement something so that you can conveniently reprocess the old docs, or do a little bit of post-processing to fix the \"errors\". For the doesn't-yet-exist case, checking online or comparing crates (which sounds risky) would be the only real ways, I suppose.\n",

    "body": "I would like to re-open discussion on this issue (@steveklabnik, I think you would be the one to ping).\r\n\r\nWith https://docs.rs/ in place, I think all `rustdoc` documentation for public crates should provide a canonical link to the appropriate documentation there. Why? Search for any popular crate on Google and you get  a litter of confusing, often outdated self-hosted versions of the docs. This may lead the programmer to accidentally study outdated publications of documentation (e.g. when not depending on a specific version of a library), and use and perhaps even bookmark publications that may be partially broken or are not as continuously available as on https://docs.rs/.\r\n\r\nGoogle's former SEO representative has indicated that Google may [disregard](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/rel-canonical-html-head/) canonical links that result in 404 HTTP response codes. Since Google is by far the most used search engine, and it addressed this issue in a sensible way already, I personally take little issue with the possibility of 404 canonical links.\r\n\r\nHere's my logic:\r\n\r\n- Only _published_ open-source code has a need for public, search engine accessible documentation of the current kind `rustdoc` produces.\r\n- The only form of \u2018publication\u2019 of Rust crate source code that the Rust project supports is via https://crates.io and https://docs.rs/.\r\n- Therefore, if a crate is to be published, it should be published on https://crates.io/ and its docs should be published on https://docs.rs/ and this should be the reference/canonical publication.\r\n- The reference/canonical publication of a crate should suppress other publications (e.g. self-hosted) on search engine results pages for the reasons I gave in my first paragraph.\r\n- Thus, docs for crates can be expected to be published on https://docs.rs, adding a canonical link that claims so is appropriate, and if not, that isn't a blocking issue for the `rustdoc` maintainer(s).",

    "body": "After poking around the rustdoc sources a little bit I have a concrete proposal. rustdoc already supports several options on the `#[doc]` attribute to control HTML output, such as `html_favicon_url`:\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/the-doc-attribute.html#at-the-crate-level\r\n\r\nWe should add support for a `html_canonical_base_url` option, and add it to the crates that wind up as part of the `std` documentation like:\r\n`#![doc(html_canonical_base_url = \"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/\")]`\r\n\r\nIt would be picked up and stored into the `SharedContext` along with the other attributes here:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a85417f5938023d1491b44d94da705f539bb8b17/src/librustdoc/html/render.rs#L532\r\n\r\nCallers of `render` would need to pass down the relative URL from the root for a page, possibly as a member of `Page` itself:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a85417f5938023d1491b44d94da705f539bb8b17/src/librustdoc/html/layout.rs#L25\r\n\r\nThis seems to mostly be useful for `Context::item`, which constructs on-disk paths:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a85417f5938023d1491b44d94da705f539bb8b17/src/librustdoc/html/render.rs#L1478\r\n\r\nwhich calls `Context::render_item`:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a85417f5938023d1491b44d94da705f539bb8b17/src/librustdoc/html/render.rs#L1410\r\n\r\nwhich calls `layout::render`. This might require some variation of `format::href`, which currently generates URLs relative to the current URL in order to generate URLs relative to the base URL:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a85417f5938023d1491b44d94da705f539bb8b17/src/librustdoc/html/format.rs#L393\r\n\r\nThen finally, `layout::render` could join the base canonical URL, if present, with the relative URL to the page and include a `<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"{canonical_url}\">`.\r\n",
