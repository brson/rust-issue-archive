    "body": "I spent some time (and unfortunately some of Niko's) looking into this to find that a clean build was not as clean as I'd thought. The reason for this is that `glfw-rs`, which builds using `rustpkg` changed its path for the outputted binary. My insufficient error checking made it so that executions of `./configure` in q3 just kept the existing `glfw-rs` around. This means that it's the ol' binary incompatability ICE with a bit of extra confusion on top. I updated my `configure` script here ( https://github.com/jeaye/q3/commit/cd238a2cd5db741afd4400040f3efd49c0b34e70 ) to properly copy based on the new path that `rustpkg` gives and the problem is resolved.\n\nSorry for asserting I was properly cleaning when I was not (lesson learned -- always test on a clean clone).\n\nEDIT:\nTo answer the question of (why was it working with the previous commit?): I had to update `glfw-rs` when I updated Rust, since some changes went in. This had a side effect of bringing the new build path from rustpkg. What broke it was updating `glfw-rs` and not being prepared for a path change.\n",
