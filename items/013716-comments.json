    "body": "I wanted to clarify something about the plan with DST. Currently, we allow a third variant of the above:\n\n``` rust\nfn use_slice(s: &[u8]) {}\nfn main() {\n    let s: [u8, ..3] = [0,1,2];\n    use_slice(s);\n}\n```\n\nIn other words, we coerce from `[T, ..n]` to `&[T]`. This rule is inconsistent with our general move away from auto-borrowing coercions.\n\nMy question is: as part of the DST coercion work, are you planning to remove this coercion?\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if it might make sense to replace this coercion with `&[T, ..n]` to `&[T]` separately from DST, just as we've been removing various other coercions like auto-cross-borrowing to front-load breaking changes?\n\ncc @nikomatsakis @pcwalton \n",

    "body": "I believe we should not coerce from `[T, ..n]` to `&[T]`  but instead just `&[T, ..n]` to `&[T]` (that is, the usual sized-to-unsized coercion). It does mean that `foo([1, 2, 3])` becomes `foo(&[1, 2, 3])`, but that seems more consistent with everything else in the language. If we wanted to address the need to write things like `map.find(&3)`, it seems like the right way to do that is across the board with some sort of \"autoref\" coercion.\n",
