    "body": "I'm very strongly against removing `*mut`: using only `*` would make FFI much harder to get right, because there would then be no distinction between C functions taking `const T*` and those taking `T*`. This means that one (a) has to remember to check _the C_ definition\\* (there's no information in the Rust code, other than possibly a comment) to see whether an argument is mutated, and (b) can start mutating variables that are theoretically immutable.\n\nExample of this I fixed recently, where a non-`mut` value was passed into a C function via `&res`, but the C function modified it. https://github.com/mozilla/rust/commit/4cc723dc22e5ebcbac4dc431a82ea75bc9ae6017#diff-f0ba70706ebd16d4c6868bbfc6f68dcaR45\n\nIf we ever start informing LLVM of mutability/immutability (assuming this is possible), then doing the above would be undefined behaviour.\n\nOne might argue \"FFI is unsafe anyway\", but `*mut` is a tiny feature that makes it _much_ harder to screw up. (Especially with #2124, which will make many FFI definitions \"automatically\" correct about `const T*` <-> `*T` and `T*` <-> `*mut T`, which isn't currently the case with our libc bindings.)\n",

As I wrote recently in an e-mail thread, my concern with `*mut` is that it does not exist in C and it's meaning is unintuitive. I think in practice most people write `*` and then transmute as needed, or else pass a `*` into C functions that mutate its referent (effectively the same thing -- and precisely what happened here, it sounds like). I'd rather have a `*T` type with precisely the same meaning as C (well, modulo placement of the\n`*`).\n\nI could imagine adding `*const T` (with precisely the same meaning as C), but only if it helps with optimization somewhere.  (Note that I would not favor adding const anywhere but unsafe pointers; it would invalidate all the progress [1] we've been making on `&mut` and aliasing.)\n\nI think that the only sensible interpretation of the current pointer types is that `*T` means what `const T*` means in C and and `*mut T` means what `T*` means in C. So I could also imagine having no `*T`,\nbut just `*const T` and `*mut T`.\n",

    "body": "Thinking more on the issue, I'm pretty sure that our current types are wrong, but I'm not yet sure of the best _fix_. It would be nice if the bug @huonw mentions could not occur so easily. The fundamental problem seems to be that `*T` means one thing in Rust (read-only) but something else in C (mutable), so people who are transcribing fn signatures tend to use the wrong sigil. Then in Rust code they write `&x` (which also means one thing in Rust and another in C), rely on the coercion from `&T` to `*T`, and get a wacky result. If `*T` meant mutable, and we only coerced from `&mut T` to `*T`, this would be solved -- but if `*T` were the only type, it would be annoying to require coercion from `&mut T` _only_, since many pointers are read-only. This seems to argue that we do require distinct read-only and mutable pointer types, if we hope to avoid this bug, though I continue to think that calling them `*T` and `*mut T` is not a good idea. It's inconsistent with other Rust pointer types (where `*T` is _immutable_, not read-only, which we can't hope to enforce here) and inconsistent with C (where `*T` is mutable).\n\n@erickt you may have an opinion here, I know that safety of `*` has been a longtime concern of yours.\n",
