    "body": "This is a fundamental limitation of `OsString` and how it represents two different encodings on Unix and Windows. It is certainly possible to add many more APIs over time to perform various operations on an `OsStr` such as looking for prefixes, splitting, etc.\n\n> Or depending on the unix-only as_bytes() method on OsStrExt\n\nThere is also an `encode_wide` function on Windows for performing this sort of operation.\n\nThis issue, however, boils down to requesting more functionality be added to `OsStr` (new APIs), and belongs in the RFC repo instead of the `rust-lang/rust` repo. Would you be ok opening an issue over there instead?\n",
