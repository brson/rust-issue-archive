  "body": "This is the start of my attempt to address #2092.\n## What this is\n\nRight now, when you compile with an error, you get this:\n\n```\nsteve@computer:~/tmp$ cat hello.rs \nfn foo(x: int) {\n    match x {\n        1 .. 10 => (),\n        7       => (),\n        _       => (),\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n\n}\nsteve@computer:~/tmp$ rustc hello.rs \nhello.rs:4:9: 4:10 error: unreachable pattern [E0001] (pass `--explain E0001` to see a detailed explanation)\nhello.rs:4         7       => (),\n                   ^\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nNote the `[E0001]` error code and the ability to get an explanation.\n\n```\nsteve@computer:~/tmp$ rustc --explain E0001\n\n    This error suggests that the expression arm corresponding to the noted pattern\n    will never be reached as for all possible values of the expression being matched,\n    one of the preceeding patterns will match.\n\n    This means that perhaps some of the preceeding patterns are too general, this\n    one is too specific or the ordering is incorrect.\n```\n\nThis is sweet! But we can do better.\n## What this adds\n\nWith this PR applied, you get this instead:\n\n```\nsteve@computer:~/tmp$ rustc hello.rs \nhello.rs:4:9: 4:10 error: unreachable pattern [E0001] (pass `--explain E0001` to see more detail or visit http://doc.rust-lang.org/errors/E0001.html for extensive help with this error)\nhello.rs:4         7       => (),\n                   ^\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nAlong with the doc machinery to generate that page. This should give us a place to provide even more help around errors, and guide people through problems. If they don't have an internet connection, they can see the pages locally as well.\n\nThis PR isn't really 'ready' yet, but I wanted to get some feedback. The error pages don't display CSS correctly, and I think I screwed up my git-fu to fix that error message, but I'm about to jump on a plane. Please let me know what you think, and I'll keep working on this if it's a path we want to go down.\n",
