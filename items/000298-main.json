  "body": "Pretty-printed stuff now tends to compile (though there's this issue with @mutable not parsing, so I haven't tried compiling a fully pretty-printed rustc). It also usually looks quite okay, except that line overflows in nested 'horizontal' blocks are handled pretty poorly and tend to result in hideous right-margin-hugging messes. I'll look further into that at some point in the future.\n",
