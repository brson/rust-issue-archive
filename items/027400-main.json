  "body": "This commit is an implementation of [RFC 1183](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1183) which allows swapping out\nthe default allocator on nightly Rust. No new stable surface area should be\nadded as a part of this commit.\n\nTwo new attributes have been added to the compiler:\n- `#![needs_allocator]` - this is used by liballoc (and likely only liballoc) to\n  indicate that it requires an allocator crate to be in scope.\n- `#![allocator]` - this is a indicator that the crate is an allocator which can\n  satisfy the `needs_allocator` attribute above.\n\nThe ABI of the allocator crate is defined to be a set of symbols that implement\nthe standard Rust allocation/deallocation functions. The symbols are not\ncurrently checked for exhaustiveness or typechecked. There are also a number of\nrestrictions on these crates:\n- An allocator crate cannot transitively depend on a crate that is flagged as\n  needing an allocator (e.g. allocator crates can't depend on liballoc).\n- There can only be one explicitly linked allocator in a final image.\n- If no allocator is explicitly requested one will be injected on behalf of the\n  compiler. Binaries and Rust dylibs will use jemalloc by default where\n  available and staticlibs/other dylibs will use the system allocator by\n  default.\n\nTwo allocators are provided by the distribution by default, `alloc_system` and\n`alloc_jemalloc` which operate as advertised.\n\nCloses #27389\n",
