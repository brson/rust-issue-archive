    "body": "@japaric \n\nSo. I've been talking a bunch with the core team about this PR. Unfortunately, it's a bit unclear whether we want to move in this direction -- whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Simplifies things in the compiler/type system by largely removing a special case.\n- Allows for inherent methods on `str` -- but note, it does _not_ allow us to do away with extension traits because some of the operators must be defined in `liballoc`.\n\n**Drawbacks**:\n- Raises problems with naming that don't have very good solutions (at least, not without a lot of churn).\n- Having the API split between inherent methods and extension traits is not necessarily helpful -- especially since we plan to \"facade\" the core extension traits in `libstd` so that there is one per built-in type.\n\nAt the moment, this change does not seem worth it, because it makes `str` more of a special case in the library wrt other \"basic\" types (primitive or not), and likely requires us to use a bad name (like `str_slice`) somewhere. Note that we can't do away with the module entirely since we still need a place for the extension trait to go.\n\n@japaric, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the above, and whether you see additional benefits or drawbacks we should consider, or alternative routes.\n\ncc @alexcrichton @nikomatsakis \n",

    "body": "(I was going to say that it's necessary to convert `str` into a library type in order to get string literals to store their size in their type, i.e. `\"foo\"` would have type `&'static str([u8, ..3])` (as sketched in its [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0339-statically-sized-literals.md)). But, I think that it's still possible to accomplish something similar without touching the `str` primitive, for example we could change the type of string literals to `&'static FixedStr([u8, ..N])`, and make `&FixedStr` coercible to `&str`. Either way would be backward incompatible change, but, more importantly, I haven't seen anyone pushing to get that RFC done by 1.0, so most likely it'll get postponed until the next major version (which makes sense because AFAIK that change is not useful without CTFE and integers as type parameters))\n\nWith that out of the way, of the two benefits you have mentioned, the first one will go mostly unnoticed by the community. And the second one is not really relevant anymore, because we are getting \"facade\" extension traits. That means that this PR will effectively break downstream code for no gain at all. And that's a good reason to not land this when we are so close to 1.0.\n\nFeel free to close this, unless someone can think of a good reason to actually do this.\n",

It also makes sense (to me) to have `str` in the library if we ever get string literals for arbitrary types implementing a trait, because (theoretically) `str` could stop being a lang item altogether. Then `Str` could be on equal footing with types like `Str16` that could represent strings but with different encodings, and of course fixed-size strings if we ever get them.\n\n(BTW, fixed-size string literals would certainly be useful without CTFE or integral generic parameters. For example, `box *\"foo\"` could be used to create a `Box<str>`, where there is no way to do so today in safe code. More generally speaking, `str` is currently lacking the fixed-size equivalent necessary to make DST coercions possible, rendering it quite hard to use in a few places.)\n",

Module imports of\n> std::str would still have to avoid the name conflict, but in a way that\u2019s\n> a good thing IMO\u2014intuitively, I expect the str in str::foo to represent\n> the same thing as the str in &str.\n> \n> My 2\u00a2 regarding the whole situation: is it too late for an RFC renaming\n> str to Str and moving it into the library? That way, all naming problems\n> get solved. We already have both std::string and String, so it makes\n> sense to me to also have std::str and Str. It also makes sense (to me) to\n> have str in the library if we ever get string literals for arbitrary\n> types implementing a trait, because (theoretically) str could stop being\n> a lang item altogether. Then Str could be on equal footing with types\n> like Str16 that could represent strings but with different encodings, and\n> of course fixed-size strings if we ever get them.\n> \n> (BTW, fixed-size string literals would certainly be useful without CTFE or\n> integral generic parameters. For example, box *\"foo\" could be used to\n> create a Box<str>, where there is no way to do so today in safe code.\n> More generally speaking, str is currently lacking the fixed-size\n> equivalent necessary to make DST coercions possible, rendering it quite\n> hard to use in a few places.)\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19612#issuecomment-67128210.\n",

With a default type parameter `[u8]` nothing will change, but this is a move into that direction.\n\nThe magic about this type in the compiler would be reduced to the handling of string literals.\n",
