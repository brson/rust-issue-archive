But, I noticed that that the directory from which I wanted to run my tests did not exist.\n\nMy makefile was trying to create the test binary in a directory that did not exist. Once the directory was created, the issue no longer presented itself.\n\nMy apologies for the mix up. If you'd like any other information I would be happy to provide it.\n\nI also changed the code to this:\n\n``` rust\n#[crate_type = \"lib\"];\n#[crate_id = \"encode64#0.1\"];\n#[desc = \"Encode hex messages as base64\"];\n\nextern crate serialize;\n\nuse serialize::base64::{ToBase64, STANDARD};\nuse serialize::hex::{FromHex};\n\npub fn encode(to_encode: &str) -> ~str {                                        \n    let hexed = to_encode.from_hex();\n    if hexed.is_ok() {\n            hexed.unwrap().to_base64(STANDARD)                                  \n    }\n    else {\n        ~\"error found in hexing\"\n    }\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn using_encode(){\n    let input  = ~\"49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120\\\n706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d\";\n    let expected = ~\"SSdtIGtpbGxpbmcgeW91ciBicmFpbiBsaWtlIGEgcG9pc29ub3VzIG11c2\\\nhyb29t\";\n    let result = encode(input);\n    assert_eq!(result, expected);\n}\n\n```\n\nThanks.\n",
