    "body": "I think, in truth, that the `Vector` trait is misnamed.  Really it is a trait that says \"you can get a readable array view into me\".\n\nIf I can take it further ... currently it feels like there is an inconsistency in `std::slice` between the vector-like traits.  There is:\n- `Vector` - an object can provide a slice view into itself (`as_slice`).  \n- `ImmutableVector` - an object provides methods for slicing and dicing by integral index (and it doesn't inherit from `Vector` btw).\n- `MutableVector` - an object provides both a slice view into itself (`as_mut_slice`) _and_ methods for directly manipulating that object.  \n\nIn practice, this means I can write a generic function `fn needs_slice<T: Vector>(x: &T)` that manipulates `x` only via its `as_slice` representation.  And I can easily declare that some new funky object can masquerade as a slice by simply implementing a single method.  Good.\n\nIn contrast, I can also write a function `fn needs_mut_slice<T: MutableVector>(x: &T)` that manipulates `x` only via its slice representation `as_mut_slice`.  But I can't declare that some new funky object can masquerade as a mutable slice without adding a bunch of other methods that I don't actually want exposed on that object ... when all I really want to do is implement just `as_mut_slice`. Less Good.\n\nSo it feels like there should be four traits:\n- `SliceAccessor` - an object can provide a slice view into itself (`as_slice`) (the existing `Vector`)\n- `MutableSliceAccessor` - an object can provide a mutable slice view into itself (`as_mut_slice`) (NEW)\n- `ImmutableVector` - an object provides a large number of methods for slicing and dicing itself.\n- `MutableVector` - an object provides methods for directly manipulating the object.\n\nSorry, all a bit long ...\n",
