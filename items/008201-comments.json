    "body": "Also, your implementation of the glob is inefficient when it hits `AnySequence`. It loops until the end of the string, trying to match at each position. This is fine for patterns that only have a single `*`, but any pattern that has multiple `*` will perform badly.\n\nInstead, you can split your pattern on all instances of `*` (and coalesce them too.. `foo**bar` is equivalent to `foo*bar`) and match each sub-pattern in sequence. Once you find a match for a subpattern, never backtrack. Because `*` matches anything, if a subpattern matches at one location, but the overall pattern does not, trying to re-match that subpattern at a later location will never cause the overall pattern to match.\n",
