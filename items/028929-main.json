  "body": "Major revision to the dropck_legal_cycles test.\n1. Added big comment block explaining the test framework.\n2. Added tests exericising Rc and Arc. This was inspired by a comment\n   from eefriedman on PR #28861.\n3. Made the cycle-detection not issue false-positives on acyclic dags.\n   \n   Doing this efficiently required revising the framework; instead of\n   visiting all children (i.e. doing a traversal), now each test is\n   responsible for supplying the path that will act as a witness to\n   the cycle.\n   \n   Luckily for me, all of the pre-existing tests worked with a trivial\n   path built from \"always tke your first left\", but new tests I added\n   did require other input paths (i.e., \"first turn right, then left\".\n   \n   (The path representation is a bit-string and its branches are\n   n-ary, not word phrases and binary branches as you might think\n   from the outline above.)\n\ncc PR #27185\n",
