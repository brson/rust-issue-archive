    "body": "This is awesome! I won't comment too closely on the code yet because you say it's still a work in progress, but here's some high-level comments:\n- First off, great work!\n- I personally think that this would belong better in `libextra` rather than `libstd`. Regardless, one of the core devs should probably weigh in on which one.\n- libstd/extra have `#[deny(missing_doc)]` by default because we want the standard of code to be pretty high. Would you mind adding documentation for everything?\n- This would be an excellent candidate for an implementation of the `Rand` trait\n- You made a trait `IUUID`, but you didn't implement it anywhere? If you're not implementing the trait on multiple objects, you can probably just remove it altogether\n- Right now macro import/export don't work in general, and I think the idea was for `uuid!()` to create a compile-time macro anyway. This can probably be removed for inclusion at a later date (if it's still necessary)\n- In the methods about the version/variant info, could you link directly to the wikipedia or equivalent docs? I had no idea that was even a thing!\n- The constructor methods should be on `UUID` itself, those are the conventions nowadays. Normally there's a `Type::new() -> Type` method and then you can add relevant others as `Type::new_with_fancy_options(...) -> ...`\n\nOverall, nice work!\n\nEdit: also if you could rebase everything into one patch, that's probably the best route to go (as opposed to having logs of smaller commits, perhaps not all of which build)\n",

    "body": "OK, this looks great, but does need some updates before merging. I agree with all of @alexcrichton's comments, so please make sure when you update the pull to make sure they are addressed (I don't see any of those changes reflected here yet).\n\nSome requests:\n- Regarding hash-based ID's I suggest not adding them until there's an obvious demand.\n- Since there's no way to get a UUIDFields, let's not make it public for now.\n- There's only one way to convert to a string `to_simple_string`. Do you have firm plans to add other string conversions? If not, let's remove that method in favor of `ToStr`.\n- Similarly to the constructor issue, the conversions `from_bytes` and `from_fields` should be methods called `from_etc`.\n- The `UUID` acronym in all cases should be typed `Uuid`. This is our current, semi-official style for acronyms.\n\nAlso please do squash these commits into a single one so there aren't intermediate commits that don't build.\n\nThanks!\n",

I have addressed all the above suggestions, just not pushed my changes yet.\n- Hash-based IDs: agreed, easy to add later\n- Made UuidFields non-public\n- Made a single `to_str` impl\n- Constructors are `from_bytes`, `from_fields` and `from_str` as discussed\n- Changed `UUID` to `Uuid`, and also made the enums use CamelCase\n\nI will squash all these together.
