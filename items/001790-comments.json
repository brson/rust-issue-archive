    "body": "Fine with me to close.  Also, the existing \"autoderef\" can help a lot here.  @Aluminium95 I would suggest coding your example like this:\n\n```\nenum Foo = {\n    a: int, b: float\n}\n```\n\nnow you can construct a value like `let x = Foo(10, 11f)` and you can access the fields like `x.a` or `x.b`.  \n\nThis syntax is shorthand for\n\n```\nenum Foo {\n    Foo({a: int, b: float})\n}\n```\n\nand the compiler treats an enum with one variant where that variant has only one piece of associated data specially, allowing it to be \"dereferenced\" to obtain the data within.  `*x` (continuing the example above) would have the type `{a: int, b: float}`.\n\nIt took me a while to realize that you could do it like this.  It's pretty decent.\n",
