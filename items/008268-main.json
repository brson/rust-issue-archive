  "body": "- Lifted the quality of the either and result module to that of option\n- Made naming schemes consistent between Option, Result and Either\n\nI also touched up on two issues that haven't yet reached a real consensus, so it wouldn't wonder me if this PR doesn't go through uncontested:\n- Changed Options Add implementation to work like the maybe Monad (return None if any of the inputs is None)  \n  See https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6002, especially my last comment.\n- Renamed Option::unwrap to Option::get and Option::take_unwrap to Option::take_get  \n  See also https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/7887, In my opinion, at least for these enums, `get` as unwrap operation, and `get_ref` as take-reference operation seem to make most sense.\n\nTodo: \n\nAdding testcases for all function in the three modules. Even without the few functions I added, the coverage wasn't complete to begin with. But I'd rather do that as a follow up PR, I've touched to much code here already, need to go through them again with a clear mind.\n",
