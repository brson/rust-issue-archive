    "body": "@vadimcn hold on: @alexcrichton's original concern was  \"invoking a process can be pretty expensive if it happens many times for a very small compilation\"; and that I can understand, e.g. if this PR were to add many process spawns for a single compilation, that would be bad.  And it would also be bad if it were to add just one process spawn where there were zero before.\n\nAnd yes, `compiletest` is indeed spawning off a `rustc` per-test.\n\nBut with the memoization strategy, we are talking about adding one process spawn of `cc --version` for the first time that you attempt to build up the command line for invoking `cc` for the link step, which I assume follows soon thereafter.  Shouldn't the time added for invoking `cc --version` and parsing its output be _dwarfed_ by the time taken by linking, even for the smallest of compilations (and even on platforms where process spawns are relatively expensive)?\n\nWhere is my reasoning going wrong here?\n\n---\n\nIf `compiletest` really is a concern, then I guess we could further attempt to allow `compiletest` to do this check regarding the backend driver and then pass that info along to `rustc`.  But that's more infrastructure than I really feel like putting in.\n\n---\n\nIt seems like `clang` is the one that is forcing our hand here, in terms of stating up front that passing these options is going to become a hard error in the future, and I am trying to prepare us for that reality in a robust way.\n",
