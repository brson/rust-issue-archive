    "body": "continuing from #19673\n\n> When it comes to deriving, unless we hard-code one specific algorithm, I don't think we have any option other than incrementally updating a hash (e.g. just calling .hash(state) on all members).\n\n@alexcrichton That's right, such an algorithm would have to be aware of generics. There is another approach to this problem: attempting to optimize these calls to .hash(state) while still doing them for all members.\n\n> For example the &[u8] type likely cannot hash well due to the lack of specialization implementations, whereas the &str type can likely hash very well due to actually being one call to .write().\n\nI think the impl of Hash for &str has two calls to .write().\n\n> I'm sorry I didn't quite follow your comment, but are you basically saying that requiring .write() + .finish() is imposing overhead, even in the &str case for example? Are you also saying that this is not inherent to the SipHasher implementation, but rather inherent to the design of the hashing traits?\n\nPerhaps using .finish() imposes inevitable overhead, but I wouldn't worry much about it. In my comment, I tried to make an implementation that would do much less work incrementally, yes, because @thestinger didn't support his ideas with a concrete design. Nothing came out of that. I have overestimated LLVM's understanding of pointer arithmetic optimization.\n",
