I think the error handling in librustdoc could definitely use some improvement, and in this case I think the best solution is to just present the error better. \n\n@GuillaumeGomez I don't think printing the error or returning a blank error is the right thing to do here, but rather this should be propagated upwards to get printed out at a later time. In theory a bigger infrastructure is also needed for attaching context to errors as it's propagated up the stack (e.g. what Cargo does), but it may be somewhat involved to add. I'd be fine opening an issue if this is getting a little too large for this PR!\n",
