    "body": "There are some changes and optimizations unrelated to `ResizePolicy`, specifically removing the drop flag.\n\nTo begin with, `ResizePolicy` is a trait that allows the user to define conditions under which the allocated table is grown or shrunk. In other words, it controls how much unused capacity a hashmap can have. It's a (possibly non-trivial) combination of the minimum capacity, the load factor, and shrinking behavior.\n\nAn extra type parameter isn't added exactly \"everywhere\" thanks to default type parameters. `ResizePolicy` is an ordinary abstraction. It reminds me of fmt's `GenericRadix`.\n\nThe proposed implementation has flaws:\n- it's still impossible to instantiate a HashMap with a custom load factor unless we add a method called `with_capacity_hasher_and_resize_policy`. Rust's methods rarely have excessively long names.\n- the effects of `reserve` depend on the ResizePolicy and might be different than expected.\n\nWe can keep using what the author calls a \"hackish fraction type\". The disadvantages of the current approach are marginal for librustc since hashmaps are often kept on the stack, I suppose. But a fine-grained control should be desirable for Servo. According to @cgaebel, two load factors are particularly useful: approximately 92% and 84%. The latter would make the probing read a single cache line most of the time, at the expense of a higher memory usage.\n\nAlso, we can make it an internal mechanism without the use of type parameters for now.\n",

    "body": "Do you have any concrete numbers for where this improves existing applications? The reduction of size of a HashMap to just 64 bytes seems appealing, but it would be useful to see how beneficial this is to applications such as `rustc`.\n\nI'm not personally worried about consumers of the `HashMap` type, but I am quite worried about users looking at the documentation of `HashMap` as well as anyone reading this code. Each impl block already has 5 type parameters (a _very_ high number), and this is adding yet another that needs to be comprehended. The defaults are almost never in place on the impl blocks, so there needs to be a tradeoff in how understandable we want the documentation to be or how rustdoc should change to accommodate use cases such as this.\n\nI'm also curious about @brson's questions, \"why is it needed, and what are the downsides if we don't have it?\". I'm not sure that the answer for why is this needed that 1% of use cases _may_ use this would justify it. Extending this would add a resize policy type parameter to almost all collections: `Vec`, `PriorityQueue`, `BTree`, `LruCache`, `Trie`, etc.\n",

And I believe that `rustc` has not too many `HashMap`s and they usually live on the stack (a difference of 2sec in my numbers is most likely a measurement error). I'll have to look somewhere else for numbers.\n\nBy the way, it's very difficult to squeeze out further two more pointers without a significant loss of performance. But it _might_ be possible.\n\n@alexcrichton, this is concerning. The first time I had a closer look at `HashMap`, I had already found its type parameters confusing and nonintuitive. Although the syntax should better be understandable and the docs are getting really unreadable, it doesn't mean it shouldn't be done this way.\n\nFortunately, `Vec` doesn't require anything that is currently a part of `ResizePolicy`; it has no load factor and no shrinking policy.

    "body": "Would it be possible to split this PR into two parts? The only controversial part of it seems to be the `ResizePolicy` trait, and since this PR doesn't even provide a way for the user to specify a custom policy, I don't think it would hurt too much to only have `DefaultResizePolicy`. Additionally, the padding measurements seem to imply that the space optimization part helps quite a lot.\n",

    "body": "For now, I'll make `DefaultResizePolicy` a private type without a trait.\n\nAlso, I realized that _all_ collections will get yet another default type parameter once the \"Allocator trait\" RFC gets accepted. Which one should come first? I'm convinced this warrants an RFC.\n\nKeyword arguments would make changes like these much less painful. Hopefully the use of type parameters will improve as well, for instance by bringing back impls on typedefs (#6087, #9767).\n",
