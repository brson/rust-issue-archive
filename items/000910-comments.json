    "body": "The language reference is actually quite explicit about this:\n\n\"A task may transition to the failing state at any time, due to an un-trapped signal or the evaluation of a fail expression. Once failing, a task unwinds its stack and transitions to the dead state. Unwinding the stack of a task is done by the task itself, on its own control stack. If a value with a destructor is freed during unwinding, the code for the destructor is run, also on the task's control stack. Running the destructor code causes a temporary transition to a running state, and allows the destructor code to cause any subsequent state transitions. The original task of unwinding and failing thereby may suspend temporarily, and may involve (recursive) unwinding of the stack of a failed destructor. Nonetheless, the outermost unwinding activity will continue until the stack is unwound and the task transitions to the dead state. There is no way to \u201crecover\u201d from task failure. Once a task has temporarily suspended its unwinding in the failing state, failure occurring from within this destructor results in hard failure. The unwinding procedure of hard failure frees resources but does not execute destructors. The original (soft) failure is still resumed at the point where it was temporarily suspended. \"\n",

    "body": "This not only applies to destructors failing while failing, but this appears to also apply to linked failure as well. A program may only contain one `fail!()` statement, but it may still leak due to linked failure. An example of this would be:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::rt::io::timer;\n\nstruct A {\n  b: B,\n}\n\nstruct B {\n  foo: int,\n}\n\nimpl Drop for A {\n  fn drop(&mut self) {\n    timer::sleep(50);\n  }\n}\n\nimpl Drop for B {\n  fn drop(&mut self) {\n    println!(\"dropping b\\n\");\n  }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  do spawn {\n    let _a = A { b: B { foo: 3 } };\n  }\n  fail!()\n}\n```\n\nThe destructor for `B` never runs in this program because the call to `timer::sleep` invokes scheduler business which will realize that it needs to fail due to linked failure. It seems odd to me that if a task only contains one source of failure then we can still leak.\n\nThis specific use case may not entirely fall under this issue, but it seems fairly serious.\n",

    "body": "I've updated the title to reflect what we're currently talking about.\n\nMy understanding is that it is just impossible to throw from a landing pad because it will potentially corrupt the unwinder and our three options are:\n- abort - this is what C++ does\n- resume unwinding without completing the landing pad - this is what Ada does and we haven't discussed this option\n- abort the task without completing unwinding - this is \"hard\" failure we've talked about\n\nThe \"hard\" failure is made more difficult by tasks that are not simply green threads. For example, we have use cases where we want to run in a 'task context', on the current thread, and then be told whether the task succeeded or failed, all on the same thread. There's no way in that scenario to just terminate the task cleanly.\n\nMy current opinion is that, for 1.0 we should take the most conservative approach and abort. For future versions we should consider trying to do what Ada does and skip _a single landing pad_, but still proceed to catch the exception.\n",

    "body": "I agree with double-abort for 1.0.\n\nThinking about the other two schemes in terms of how RWARCs (or whatever they're called these days) behave, aborting just a single task strikes me as risky in terms of unexpected behaviour befalling the user. If a double-failure occurs inside an access to a RWARC, it won't be automatically unlocked during unwinding, and other contending tasks will block forever.\n\nI think that resuming the unwinding and skipping the one landing pad still makes sense, though. If double-failure occurs in a user-provided destructor (or in the destructor of some buggy library), skipping the rest of the destructor can only \"surprise\" other code directly associated with the faulty destructor.\n",
