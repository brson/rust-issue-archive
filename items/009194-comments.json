    "body": "I'm actually fairly opposed to this change. Polling for synchronization primitives in my opinion is the wrong way to implement timeouts. If you think about the polling intervals, it turns out that polling is wrong 100% of the time. Each time the poller decides to go to sleep, it should not have awoken. When the poller decides that the timeout is done, then it was too late, so every guess by the poller is \"wrong\" in a sense.\n\nIt looks like we don't currently have support for accurate timeouts in the libuv loop yet, so I'm ok with these functions existing in some form, but they should be extremely clear that they perform polling and not accurate timeouts. When I write code to have timeouts, I expect the library to have it implemented such that there is no polling and that timeouts occur in a timely fashion.\n\nEspecially in this implementation you could wait for _up to a second_ waiting for an event to happen when in fact it already happens. In my opinion this extremely undesirable, especially from a core library perspective.\n\nCould you explain a bit more why we think that this is the desired strategy to settle on now for timeouts? If this is purely an interim solution (blocked on one easy bug), then I think that it still shouldn't be added, and in the long run if we need some general rearchitecting it seems like we still shouldn't add timeouts in this form.\n",
