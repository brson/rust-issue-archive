    "body": "This seems like a pretty cool feature, but it's also a little worrying to me. Right now you can declare `unsafe_no_drop_flag` and `unsafe_non_zero_word` and the compiler performs 0 checks to make sure you do _anything_ sanely. I would expect `unsafe_non_zero_word` to at least verify that the struct's size is only 1 word.\n\nIt does make sense to flag them with `unsafe`, but it's not immediately clear _why_ these attributes have `unsafe` in front of them. With `unsafe` blocks the compiler will tell you the specific reason that you want them, but with these attributes the compiler will just silently assume that you're obeying whatever contract is necessary.\n\nI'm not really sure what the best answer to that is. Arguably the only way to actually learn of the attributes would be to read about them in some documentation, so the best solution could be to just document them well.\n",
