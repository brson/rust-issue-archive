  "body": "### Breaking changes:\n- **Removed unnecessary `box` from enum variant (`Object(Box<Object>)` becomes `Object(Object)`)**\n- **Deprecated `Encoder::str_encode`**\n### Other changes:\n- Tried to make the code more idiomatic\n- Renamed the `wr` field of the `Encoder` and `PrettyEncoder` structs to `writer`\n- Replaced some `from_utf8` by `from_utf8_owned` to avoid unnecessary allocations\n- Removed unnecessary `unsafe` code\n- Added `encode` and `decode` shortcut functions\n- Implemented `FromStr` for `Json`\n- Implemented `ToJson` for tuples of arity up to 12\n- Fixed some details in the documentation\n### Questions\n- ~~The `encode` shortcut function does the same as the `Encoder::str_encode` function. It seems wrong to me that two functions do exactly the same. Should we deprecate `Encoder::str_encode`?~~\n- ~~Do we really want the ToJson trait for tuples? At the moment we have it for (), (A, B), (A, B, C). I would like to remove them.~~\n- ~~We are using `String` as key in the `TreeMap` representing a `Json` object. It would be better to use `&str`, but this would require to annotate lots of lifetimes. Is there any easy solution for this?~~\n- There is a lot of duplicated code (`PrettyEncoder` copies about 50 lines from `Encoder`). In an OO language this could be solved very elegantly by using inheritance and overriding. What can we do here to reduce the amount of boilerplate?\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
