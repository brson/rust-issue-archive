    "body": "@luqmana Yes, though I suggest renaming it, since it will no longer just be used for 'registering', nor does it strictly have anything to do with tasks or weak tasks from the kernel's perspective - this count is only for determining when to shutdown the runtime. Maybe `inc_live_count` for the method name and `rust_inc_kernel_live_count` for the builtin. It's not great either, but is less wed to implementation details.\n",
