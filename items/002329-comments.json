    "body": "It's possible on anything that's movable, which includes both rvalues and local variables (it could be wider still than our current rules, as well).\n\nMotivating cases from pfox recently was something like this:\n\n```\nlet res: result<filedesc,fail> = some_io_operation();\nif res.is_failure() { ... handle failure; ... }\nlet filedesc = res.get();\n```\n\nRight now this requires that the filedescriptor by copyable (and hence not a resource).  I added an (unsafe) `unwrap()` method that handles this, but I was thinking that it would be nice to be able to handle this in a general way, rather than adding it to each type that requires it.  \n\nThis came up for @brson with options (that was what motivated the original `option::unwrap()`) in which he had some shared `option<T>` and he was swapping it out with `none` and then wanted to use the contents.  I forget the full situation.\n\nI can imagine something similar being useful with, say, a unique record that you would like to pull apart:\n\n```\nfn foo(-point: ~{x: int, y: int}) {\n    let {x, y} = move point;\n}\n```\n\nThis may work today with last-use analysis, I don't know.\n",

Moving such a path would \"de-initialize\" each subpath (`l`, `l.f`, `l.f.g`, and `l.f.g.h`).  I think that's the most general set of things we could easily support.\n",

Then it basically falls out of `move` being a unary operator: a \"by-value\" binding site automatically becomes a move if the expression in the `alt` head used the unary `move` operator.\n\nIn other words, I think there's nothing special we need to do to make this work: we just need the unary `move` operator proposal and the explicitly-by-reference pattern binding syntax.\n",
