    "body": "> Everything here is just a consolidation which should happen anyway, and this is no more difficult to understand than it was before.\n\nIn what way is it a consolidation?\n\n> You're talking about a hypothetical thing which hasn't happened yet.\n\nIt's not hypothetical. A language feature was even added with allocators as the primary use case. A good API for them has already been worked out and tested.\n\nWith this design, the containers will end up being defined in this primitive crate, with a default allocator crate providing extension methods like `new` and `with_capacity`. The standard library will then provide further extensions where failure or other runtime features are required.\n\nFor containers not in the standard library, the crate solution requires splitting them into 3 crates. Third party crates are also unable to reduce the pain to solely a documentation issue by exporting everything in a prelude.\n\n> I agree we should tread lightly when adding things like one-off traits. If you have concrete suggestions about how to explore this use case, we always welcome them, but unconstructive criticism is not particularly helpful.\n\nMy concrete suggestion to is to use compile-time selection rather than exposing many implementation details as traits and making heavy usage of dynamic dispatch. I've already explored different ways of doing this and settled on configuration flags as by far the least bad solution without explicit compiler support.\n",

    "body": "I explained the problem for containers above. This same issue reoccurs for any module that's not entirely freestanding. The `Vec<T>` type would be defined here, with `new` and `with_capacity` in the default allocator crate, and then the failing slice methods need to be split between an abort crate and the standard library. If unwinding is deemed an optional feature not requiring the rest of the runtime, then an unwinding crate is necessary as an alternative to the `abort` crate. Since the slice methods need to be split into at least two groups, you end up with two traits instead of one.\n\nFor another example, traits like `Reader` and `Writer` should be defined in this crate, as the traits themselves do not require runtime support. This means `impl Reader for ~Reader` needs to be removed along with further ripple effects.\n\nAn alternative that I'm even less fond of is using weak symbols or dynamically selected functionality for everything from unwinding vs. failure to the choice of default allocator. It's not pay-for-what-you-use and will necessitate the need for an alternative library without the overhead.\n",

    "body": "> Do you have any problems with the specific components moved in this pull request?\n\nYes, as explained above, I don't think this is the right solution. Moving them from the standard library is enacting a specific solution without having considered the alternatives.\n\n> Do you disagree that the functions moved can be used in all contexts?\n\nThis isn't part of what I'm discussing. I'm not doing a review of whether or not the code will compile, but whether is it the right design.\n\n> I am 100% behind every change made in this pull request. I never said I was 100% behind all future movements\n\nIf there is not a willingness to move all of the useful functionality not depending on the runtime to the crate, then it is a step backwards as it is far inferior to the existing solution.\n\n> If you have concerns about this pull request in specific, please voice them. If you believe that future movement will cause problems, then please suggest constructive comments for how to improve this pull request. If the comments have nothing to do with this pull request, then please save them for later.\n\nI think moving this functionality will cause problems. It will create a separate freestanding standard library without most of the usable functionality it should have. I think it will be unlikely that the rest of the usable functionality will be moved due to the sacrifices involved (as covered in my previous comments).\n\n> but rather it's supposed to eliminate any boilerplate you need to get running with rust (hiding language implementation details).\n\nIt doesn't do this, as it exposes the intrinsics in a module named _intrinsics_ rather than exposing functionality in modules based on the functionality involved. Many of these are also `unsafe` despite being completely safe, due the implementation detail of being an intrinsic. I'm all for hiding the language implementation details, but I don't really see what splitting the standard library has to do with it. The existing freestanding Rust library doesn't expose intrinsics in the public API.\n\nI think it's important to do this in a way where it can be made transparent to the user-level API documentation in the future. I don't think this split will allow for doing that due to the trait coherence rules.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger I don't understand how your arguments apply to this patch; they seem to be about future patches. I have made very few changes to the types here. This is mostly just moving modules around and thinking harder about their interdependencies than we we have in the past with everything entangled in std. std still has nearly the exact same interface, and where it doesn't it is in my opinion for the better.\n\nI am trying to figure out how to make Rust's libraries maximally useful in any environment, and doing so by extracting the parts of std that can work everywhere.\n",

I do think having everything that doesn't need runtime dependencies in one place has its own benefits, both practical and aesthetic, but I don't want to sacrifice the overall design of the standard library.\n\nI would like to have some kind of _lazy_ language item so that a crate like prim could include code that depends on the malloc and free lang items while not requiring them to be defined in the local crate. There is probably a lot of code that just needs to declare that it needs the global heap, but has no other runtime needs. If we can push most of std into the crate that only needs unique allocation then we have a highly-compatible library.\n",

    "body": "> Regardless, discussion of containers and such are irrelevant to this PR because it doesn't deal with them at all. I think we'll cross that bridge when we get there.\n\n@alexcrichton , this may very well not be the place to discuss such matters, but then where is? Instead of shutting down the discussion, please give us a link to the place where it has been previously discussed so that the discussion may continue. And if all prior discussion has only happened behind closed doors, then you shouldn't be surprised that people may be feeling blindsided by its sudden appearance.\n\nImportantly, it would be nice to have a document that establishes the scope of libprim. Freedom from dependencies is lovely, but if it only ever intends to provide 1% of what rust-core provides today, or if upfront design decisions _prevent_ it from ever providing more than that 1%, then it surely won't suffice in avoiding the sort of fragmentation that we all hope to avoid and all this work will have been for naught anyway.\n\nI'm also concerned at the latent hostility that I'm sensing towards @thestinger . And not just here in this thread, and not just from a single person. Though he's been combative in the past, Daniel has remained remarkably level-headed here despite having his opinion persistently dismissed at every opportunity.\n\nLet us also not overlook the fact that Daniel has, as far as I can tell, more experience designing dependency-free Rust library APIs than anyone else. A willingness to learn from his experience will save us time and hardship.\n\nI'm not commenting on the PR itself nor am I saying it's the wrong approach. I'm merely asking for more openness from the developers in heeding the concerns of informed and knowledgeable community members.\n",

I merely wish to voice concern regarding a broader trend that I perceive wherein Daniel's criticisms are peremptorily dismissed. I'm unsure whether this is due to his past history of confrontational language (an area in which he has greatly improved recently, much to my relief) or whether it is due to a more general allergy to criticism amongst the devs. In my opinion, his willingness to vocally point out potential design flaws (multiplied by his deep familiarity with Rust's design and implementation) makes him one of the most valuable members of the Rust community. He's a knowledgeable programmer and a hard worker. We would be much diminished without him. And yet sometimes I get the (hopefully mistaken!) impression that he's been blackballed by the developers. The fact that he's so long endured this dismissive attitude is a testament to his commitment, though I wonder for how much longer he can keep it up.\n",

This PR has not been internally discussed, so I have no links to give you for a previous discussion.\n\nFor the record, I'm personally fine with allowing the developers to land whatever they want with minimal discussion (though I don't pretend to speak for everyone). We're pre-1.0, after all, and this is pretty much how we've always operated. \"Move fast and break things.\" Just beware that going it alone risks missing out on input from people who have already explored this design space, and could waste us time in the long run. Be cautious as well to ensure that such an attitude is not misinterpreted as disdain for anyone not employed at Mozilla Research.\n",

    "body": "@bstrie Most of Daniel's criticisms that have been dismissed are of the \"throw away M:N threading right now\" variety. Please consider that we are simply not likely to abandon our work on M:N before we've even optimized it (no handle migration yet\u2014at all!); we don't have enough information to know whether it's worth it. In fact, we have some evidence that it will improve performance relative to libnative, because of the fact that we win on apachebench versus a multithreaded libnative with `RUST_THREADS=1` libgreen.\n\nFurthermore, other language communities have had great success with M:N threads; if you were to ask the GHC or Erlang designers whether we should abandon M:N threading right now, the answer would likely not be the same as what @thestinger is saying. (In fact, I know this to be the case for Erlang at least, because we have in fact asked Erlang people for their opinion on this issue!) Certainly I think we should abandon M:N threads if they don't provide improved performance relative to 1:1, but we don't know yet and I think saying \"you don't listen to Daniel\" because we don't drop them immediately is not fair to us.\n\nPlease also consider that the reason we have libnative at all is because of concerns from developers like Daniel who think that 1:1 is a better fit for their application (though Servo would certainly need some sort of 1:1 mode, or at least OS thread pinning, which is basically the same thing).\n",

All of the hash table methods will wrap the general one taking an 128-bit seed, the initial capacity and an allocator instance.\n\nContainers can and should support the freestanding use case, so if the freestanding use case is handled in a separate crate then that's where all the simple standard containers will be (vector, priority queue, circular buffer, unordered map/set, ordered map/set, ...).\n\nThis isn't specific to containers, but containers are simple so it's easy to think about how they fit into the design. It gets more complex when you have something like a JSON parser, as a JSON parser _can_ work without the runtime too.\n",

    "body": "> - I would expect that _all_ environments can assume an allocator exists, so I don't follow why `new` is a convenience method.\n\nThe `new` function is a convenience method because it assumes you want to be using a single global dynamic allocator instance across the entire program. To support allocators, there's a need for a method taking the allocator instance as a parameter and `new` becomes a wrapper around this function passing the _default_ allocator instance.\n\nThere are certainly environments without dynamic memory allocation and global variables so I don't think the `new` function can be provided in a crate supporting the freestanding use case. It _can_ be provided without the rest of the runtime, so that's a second crate.\n\nThe difference between abort and unwinding is easier to deal with and I think it could just be dealt with at a compiler level.\n\n> I would imagine that a truly generic container needs to handle allocation failure, and it doesn't appear that these methods you're talking about are designed to handle this.\n\nI haven't given any examples of methods unable to handle allocation failure. Handling the allocation error case for vectors and hash tables means returning an `Option` from functions like `push` and from those doing eager allocation like `with_capacity`. The `new`/`with_alloc` function doesn't need to allocate any memory for a vector or hash table (see `std::vec_ng`) but `new` requires a default global allocator.\n",

    "body": "Where would this leave libraries that want to work in multiple environments? For example, `zlib` has a [port](https://github.com/charsyam/linux-kernel-3.8/blob/master/lib/zlib_deflate/deflate.c) in the Linux kernel, has a standard C API with file I/O, and an idiomatic Rust API would be nice too. Could I write my own `#[cfg]` magic to keep a single `lib.rs` and compile as appropriate? \n\nIf yes, Rust should provide the appropriate options for interoperability with other such libraries and end user convenience, at which point I don't see why `libstd` wouldn't make use of them. We can refactor it without splitting into multiple crates. (I'd name it something like`#[profile(freestanding, no_libc, no_runtime, idiomatic/full_runtime]`, but that's a different issue.)\n\nIf not, and I would have to split into separate completely different crates, that would go against pretty much everything Rust has done so far with `#[crate_type]` and all the `#[cfg]` stuff. Building multiple `libstd`s is nowhere near as bad as the mess this would make in Rust libraries, especially with `rustpkg` dead and buried.\n",

    "body": "@huonw @thestinger I believe I now understand the scenario where new traits arise, e.g. huonw's [example](#issuecomment-34124425) where one needs to put `Option`'s `unwrap` method into a separate trait in a different crate, since `libprim` does not have `fail`\n\n(I'm still wrapping my head around the multiple crate issue, which AFAICT arises when a library developer wants to allow their library to be used in many target contexts; a library developer who is content to target a narrow audience, e.g. non-kernel developers, may be able to get away with only one crate.  I think.)\n\nAnyway, I want to understand the basis for objecting to splitting a method like `unwrap` off into a separate trait.  Here are the main objections I have been able to imagine (though perhaps some are invalid; feel free to point that out if so):\n- The documentation generated when a set of methods is split amongst separate traits is non-ideal.\n- Without glob imports, it is a pain to import the individual traits into client code using the methods.\n- It is more boilerplate to write each `impl` for each of the traits on a particular type that one is introducing; one would prefer to write a small number of `impls` (preferably _one_ impl) with all of the methods of interest listed underneath that single `impl`.\n\nDoes forcing the introduction of new traits have more problems that I have missed, or is the above cover the cases reasonably well?\n\n(Again, at this point I'm just trying to understand the problems introduced by the split-into-many-traits phenomenon alone; I can imagine there are further problems introduced when library developers are forced to generate several crates to ensure their library is usable in a maximal set of contexts.)\n\nI think that if we do go down this path, it definitely puts pressure on us to support glob imports properly, rather than potentially deprecating them.  The other two objections above I have less of an opinion on; my gut tells me that they seem surmountable, e.g. via better tooling for the first and some macro or some new `impl` extension for the second.\n",

I think every trait needs to be clearly thought out and should have a clear usage in generic code. It is a backwards compatibility hazard to need extra traits whenever functionality becomes optional or becomes available in the freestanding crate.\n\nEventually, nearly all of the standard library would be defined in the freestanding crate. There's no reason we can't define all the containers there and JSON/XML parsers. If 1.0 declares an interface as stable but it's not in the freestanding crate, then it either needs to be dropped or the standard library replaced.\n\nWe may decide to make a feature like floating point optional in the future, and while a configuration flag will not change the public API, splitting it out into another crate would be an API break.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger hmm, I would have thought that a trait T2 that extends another trait T would be a perfectly sensible way to represent optional functionality.\n\nBut I am going to try to understand why this is bad.  Is the core of your complaint is inherent in your phrasing that the backwards-compatibility hazard arises \"whenever functionality becomes optional\": are you talking about the scenario where in version 1.0 of the standard library, we have a trait `X` providing methods `foo` and `bar`, and then if in version 1.1 we realize that `bar` should have been optional, we no longer have a good migration path to take `bar` off of `X` and put it onto another trait `X2 : X` ?  (Verus a hypothetical `cfg` based solution where we would add some particular attributes above `bar`, but leave it in `X`, in version 1.1?)\n\nOr is it just that my original thinking about `trait T2 : T { /* optional functionalty */ }` is simply distasteful?  (It seems like that is the sort of sense of taste that led the Java designers to have dynamic `UnsupportedOperationException` on various `Iterator` methods, instead of having subinterfaces of `Iterator` that supported operations like `remove()`, which would be more in line with the sense of taste I espoused above...)\n",

    "body": "Trying to get my head around all of the above:\n\nSo splitting into crates based on platform/runtim isn't going to work because an impl can't be extended (optional functions must be added as new traits, and nobody wants a trait explosion). Would it be a potential solution if there was a way to extend an impl when re-exporting the object in std? i.e. prim::Option is a subset of std::Option (both are enums, but the std one has more methods in the impl).\n\nI've had a look at using #[cfg] to do freestanding libstd, one of the big annoyances is that the 'deriving' shortcut doesn't play nice with the cfg annotation (the deriving stuff is where lots of the dependency tangling happens). It would be good if things like derive[Clone] could be made dependent on a cfg. It also looks like the #[cfg] is done at compile time - given how rust code is handled in rlibs now it would be good to have a more powerful (lazy?) annotation that isn't evaluated till generating object code.\n\nAt least everyone is agreed that it would be nice to have libstd freestanding.\n",
