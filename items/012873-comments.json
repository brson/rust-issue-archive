    "body": "I don't see why the collections module would exclude collections we use in the standard library. It's a module for a collection, and whether it is a crate is not relevant from an API perspective. If anything, it should be deprecated to use it directly from `std::vec_ng` outside of the standard library. It's an inconsistent API design.\n\nNot re-exporting collections defined in the standard library means if one of the other collections like a hash table, it requires a backwards incompatible change. There are many use cases for a map or set in the standard library. At the moment, it makes use of various sets and maps used by the standard C library (like the allocator) but these may be in Rust in the future.\n",

Am I looking in the wrong place?\n\nThe `UnsafeArc` type should be available in `libsync` and not elsewhere. This allows users of the language to look in that crate for shared memory features, and avoids a messy API spread across many crates. It don't see the logic in doing anything else. If incremental compilation means the API to be spread all over the place, it's going to get harder and harder to predict where stuff will be as it's split up more and it means that any time the compilation model is altered a bit, backwards compatibility will have been broken.\n",
