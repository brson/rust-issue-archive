    "body": "Update: It appears that feeding a bit more type information into the body of `PartialEq::eq` gives the lifetime inference what it needs to know:\n\n``` rust\nimpl <'a> PartialEq for P<'a> {\n    fn eq(&self, other: &P<'a>) -> bool {\n        // (self as *const _) == (other as *const _)\n        (self as *const P<'a>) == (other as *const P<'a>)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is probably enough to let me make progress on the above mentioned bootstrapping.  So maybe this bug is not as important to fix as I thought it was.\n\nStill, it is strange that (I assume) the variance of `P<'a>` with respect to `'a` has an effect in this case, where the type on both sides of the `==` has been written as just `*const _`, and thus it is strange to that an covariant `P` fails while an invariant `P` succeeds.\n",
