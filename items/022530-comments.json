The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "That seems plausible.  The failing test `run-pass/sepcomp-lib-lto.rs` is built with `-C lto -O`, whose behavior changed with this PR.  I wonder if the test would also fail with `-C lto -C opt-level=2`.  If so, that would indicate this PR more strongly, but it'd also imply that LTO on Android was already broken, I think.\n\nAFAICT, it seems that the Android NDK does not have `pthread_atfork` in any static or dynamic library for ARM.  Maybe jemalloc is supposed to use the stub in `src/rt/rust_android_dummy.c`?\n",

    "body": "I think I've figured it out.\n\n`pthread_atfork` comes from `r-rust_builtin-rust_android_dummy.o`, which is linked into `libstd-4e7c5e5c.rlib`.  It's needed in `r-jemalloc-jemalloc.pic.o` in `liballoc-4e7c5e5c.rlib`.  However, `libstd` comes before `liballoc` on the linker command-line.  The linker examines `libstd` first, decides that `r-rust_builtin-rust_android_dummy.o` is unneeded and leaves it out.  Then it examines `liballoc` and sees that `pthread_atfork` is missing.  It doesn't revisit `libstd`.\n\nWith `-C opt-level=0 -C lto`, it happens to work because `sepcomp-lib-lto.o` pulls in _other_ symbols from `r-rust_builtin-rust_android_dummy.o`.  Namely, it pulls in `__errno_location`, `log2`, and `log2f`.\n\nTo help debug this issue, pass `-C link-args=\"-Wl,-Map=output.map -Wl,--cref\" -Z print-link-args -C save-temps` to rustc.\n\n`-C opt-level=0 -C lto`:\n\n```\n/home/rprichard/android-ndk-standalone-19/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc\n    -Wl,--as-needed\n    -Wl,--allow-multiple-definition\n    -L /home/rprichard/work/rust-android-local/lib/rustlib/arm-linux-androideabi/lib\n    -o sepcomp-lib-lto\n    sepcomp-lib-lto.o\n    -Wl,--whole-archive -lmorestack -Wl,--no-whole-archive\n    -Wl,--gc-sections\n    -nodefaultlibs\n    /tmp/rustc.2wZNcIqEwb2J/libstd-4e7c5e5c.rlib\n    /tmp/rustc.2wZNcIqEwb2J/liballoc-4e7c5e5c.rlib\n    -L .\n    -L /home/rprichard/work/rust-android-local/lib/rustlib/arm-linux-androideabi/lib\n    -L /home/rprichard/mess/android-test/.rust/lib/arm-linux-androideabi\n    -L /home/rprichard/mess/android-test/lib/arm-linux-androideabi\n    -Wl,--whole-archive\n    -Wl,-Bstatic\n    -Wl,--no-whole-archive\n    -Wl,-Bdynamic\n    -ldl\n    -llog\n    -lgcc\n    -lc\n    -lm\n    -Wl,-Map=output.map\n    -Wl,--cref\n    -lcompiler-rt\n```\n\ncross-reference output:\n\n```\n# __errno_location                                  /tmp/rustc.X0fdWX76ezor/libstd-4e7c5e5c.rlib(r-rust_builtin-rust_android_dummy.o)\n#                                                   sepcomp-lib-lto.o\n# log2                                              /tmp/rustc.X0fdWX76ezor/libstd-4e7c5e5c.rlib(r-rust_builtin-rust_android_dummy.o)\n#                                                   sepcomp-lib-lto.o\n#                                                   /home/rprichard/android-ndk-standalone-19/bin/../sysroot/usr/lib/libm.so\n# log2f                                             /tmp/rustc.X0fdWX76ezor/libstd-4e7c5e5c.rlib(r-rust_builtin-rust_android_dummy.o)\n#                                                   sepcomp-lib-lto.o\n#                                                   /home/rprichard/android-ndk-standalone-19/bin/../sysroot/usr/lib/libm.so\n# pthread_atfork                                    /tmp/rustc.X0fdWX76ezor/libstd-4e7c5e5c.rlib(r-rust_builtin-rust_android_dummy.o)\n#                                                   /tmp/rustc.X0fdWX76ezor/liballoc-4e7c5e5c.rlib(r-jemalloc-jemalloc.pic.o)\n```\n",
