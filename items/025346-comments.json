    "body": "Thanks for the report! I think most of this is already covered by https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/957, however, so I'm going to close this in favor of that. I have an RFC-in-progress that I hope to post soon as well for upcoming additions to the `std::net` module, and I believe that it should address most of the concerns you've listed here. Specifically though:\n\n> For example, when I was doing some tests I noticed, again at least on Windows, that if I bind to a local interface that is not set as the default interface in the system and join multicast, I wont receive multicast at all from that socket.\n\nAfter reviewing the implementations recently I agree that some of the methods involved here aren't giving you enough of a low-level interface as one might expect. The RFC will propose exposing all arguments for each socket option, including all fields of `ip_mreq` (which you've found we default some to 0).\n\n> Unless it is a different situation in Linux\n\nThe current design of the `std::net` module is to not deal with many platform differences itself beyond what APIs are exposed. For example the `shutdown` method can have subtly different semantics depending on what system you're on, but part of the contract that the standard library is providing is that you have a clear connection to the underlying primitives being called so you know what's happening. The revamp of socket options and creation (my upcoming RFC) should address this as well!\n",
