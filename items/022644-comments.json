This is essentially the same as what is occurring here, the token sequence `x as T < y` represents a prefix of two options for parses: a comparison `(x as T) < y` and a cast to a generic type `x as (T<y ... >)`. You're wanting the former but the compiler is giving the latter.\n\nOf course, it is probably rarer that one wishes to index a cast expression, so using `[]` for generics may reduce how often this ambiguity occurs in real code, but it definitely does not get rid of it.\n\nIn any case, the generic syntax is here to stay. There's been more than enough discussion about it (e.g. https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/148).\n",

    "body": "The question of how to properly parsing sequence `x as T[y ...` is a question about the operator precedence. Indexing is weaker than the `as` operator, so there is only one way of the correct parsing it: `x as (T[y ...)`. In the other hand, the question of parsing `x as T<y ...` is a question about what is `<` at all. It could be a start of generic type parameters or just comparison operator. In this case parser can't determine what is `<` and it is the reason of ambiguity.\n",

    "body": "The ambiguity on `<` also exists in C++ and C#, and doesn't cause such problems in those languages. (although the way this syntax is disambiguated is dramatically different between C++ and C#)\n\nI believe fixing this issue means we can also drop the `::` when calling generic functions: `f::<T>()` becomes `f<T>()`.\nNote that with sufficient lookahead, most programs are not actually ambiguous, because [RFC 558](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0558-require-parentheses-for-chained-comparisons.md) prevents the use of both `<` and `>` in an expression.\nReal ambiguities arise only with multiple or nested type arguments (and possibly also with UFCS syntax, I haven't yet looked at the details of that).\n`f(a<b,c>(d))` could be `f((a<b), (c>d))` or `f(a::<b,c>(d))`.\n`a as b < c < d >> - e` could be `(a as b<c<d>>) - e` or `(a as b) < c < (d >> (-e))` (with python-style chained comparison)\n\nI think introducing an C#-style disambiguation rule could possibly solve this issue with only very minor breaking changes. (these were also breaking changes in C# when generics were introduced in version 2.0, and affected very little code)\nI have an idea on how to do this, but I didn't write a concrete proposal because people didn't seem to like parser rules that require arbitrary lookahead. And because it would make it difficult to extend Rust's type syntax later without introducing additional minor breaking changes due to the disambiguation.\n",

    "body": "I agree that we don't want to copy C++'s mistakes here.\nThe C# rules are much more sane: no weird \"typename\"/\"template\" keywords for disambiguating, no need for a symbol table during parsing.\n\nThe idea is: when the parser encounters a `<` that is ambiguous, it looks ahead in the token stream and attempts to parse the type argument list. If the type argument list is not valid, backtrack and parse the `<` as less-than operator. If the type argument list is valid, look at the next token after the matching `>` to determine whether to parse the `<` as type argument list or less-than operator:\n- Next token signals end of expression, e.g. one of `; , ) ] }`: use interpretation as type argument list.\n- Next token is identifier or integer literal: use interpretation as less-than operator.\n- Next token is `{` or `(`: use interpretation as type argument list (struct initializer / function call). (this is a breaking change for the current interpretation of `f(a<b,c>(d))`)\n- For other tokens, we'd have to think about which interpretation makes more sense. In general, tokens in `FIRST(Expression)` should use the interpretation as less-than operator and tokens in `FOLLOW(Expression)` should use the interpretation as type argument list, but quite a few tokens are in both of those sets.\n\nNote that if this heuristic is wrong, the user can always choose force one or the other interpretation: Putting parentheses around the less-than operator (e.g. `f((a<b), (c>d))`) makes the interpretation as type argument list invalid and thus enforces the parse as less-than operator.\nIf a type argument list is desired, enforcing this depends on which context the type argument list is used in:\n- for a struct initializer or function call, the `{` or `(` heuristic always pick correctly.\n- where type arguments are used at the end of an expression (in `as` expression, nullary struct, ...), the expression can be enclosed in parentheses so that `>` is followed by `)` and the heuristic thus picks correctly.\n- We'd need to review all other possible places where a type argument list might appear. In general, it seems like a good idea to have the heuristic err on the side of picking the type argument list.\n\nWe can also exploit the fact that RFC 558 makes `a < b > c` invalid in expression context to always pick the type argument list interpretation (without looking at the next token after `>`) if the type argument list does not contain any comma and the `>` is not part of a `>>` token.\n\nI think this heuristic will work well enough that stuff will \"just work\" in most cases.\nIn C# it's basically perfect and most C# programmers don't even realize there is an ambiguity -- but Rust syntax a bit more flexible and may cause more problems in this regard.\n\nUpsides:\n- Fixes this issue\n- Allows us to remove `::` for generic function calls.\n\nDownsides:\n- Introduces arbitrary lookahead into the language\n- Complicated rule, users may get confused where the heuristic fails.\n  - Counterpoint: users are already confused where the current \"heuristic\" fails (see: this issue)\n- Any future extension to type syntax would expand the set of valid type argument lists, and thus might change how existing expressions are interpreted. This may make it difficult to add new type-level syntax post-1.0 without breaking existing code.\n- In particular, I have no idea how this would work with type-level integers.\n  - Counterpoint: I don't know how those would work syntactically without this idea, either -- putting a constant expression where currently a type is expected seems troublesome in general.\n",

    "body": "@dgrunwald We had this discussion back when RFC 558 was accepted and determined that such a scheme wouldn't allow us to get rid of `::<>` entirely; it would only allow us to omit the `::` for things that take a single type parameter (i.e. arity one) and the full `::<>` form would be required for typaram lists of higher arity. The upside is that this probably constitutes the majority of `::<>` usage, and so lots of code would still be cleaned up in practice. The downsides are that this would prevent us from realizing the original intent of RFC 558 (Python-style chained comparisons) while also introducing the notion of infinite lookahead into the parser (currently our lookahead is always bounded). I think it's still probably worth doing, but it was sufficiently controversial to postpone the discussion to post-1.0.\n",

    "body": "@bstrie: The C#-style lookahead heuristic in my comment works for arity > 1; it just requires adding parentheses to disambiguate some rare cases (it never requires `::<>`). It would be a breaking change, though I would be surprised if there's much (any?) real-world code that would be broken.\n\nIt doesn't require exploiting [RFC 558](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/558) for the disambiguation. RFC 558 could theoretically be used to improve the heuristic (no need to look at the token following `>`), but only in the comma-free cases (arity 1 isn't sufficient, it could also be ambiguous if the single type argument is another generic type instantiation containing commas). But I don't think we should use it; adding an additional type argument to an existing generic call should always be valid.\n\nThe ugliness of `::<>` was why I started looking into that part of the syntax in the first place (I kinda forgot about that when I wrote RFC 558 a few days later). If we add support for Python-style chained comparisons in the future, we should probably only add monotonic comparisons (allow `a < b < c` and `a > b > c`, but not `a < b > c`) to avoid conflicts with generic syntax.\n\nThe main downside of the C#-style heuristic is that future additions to the type-level syntax would be breaking changes. So I think this should be postponed until type-level integer syntax is worked out.\n",
