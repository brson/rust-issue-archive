    "body": "> native/unix - uses dup() to get another file descriptor\n\nI don't know if it's a design consideration but dup() and dup2() are not fork-safe.\n\nIf another thread calls fork() between the calls to dup() and fcntl(FD_CLOEXEC) or ioctl(FIOCLEX), then the file descriptor leaks into the new process.  You get strange bugs that way[1] and it's a security loophole.\n\ndup3() on Linux and FreeBSD >= 10 help mitigate that.  POSIX.1-2008 has fcntl(F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC).\n\nThe issue is not unique to dup(), of course.  open(), accept(), revcmsg(SCM_RIGHTS), etc. all have the same flaw.\n\n[1] For example, if the parent process adds the file descriptor to an epoll set and subsequently closes it but the file descriptor is still alive in the child process, then epoll_wait() will still report events for the closed file descriptor.  Worse, you cannot remove the file descriptor because, hey, it's closed - epoll_ctl() returns EBADF.\n",
