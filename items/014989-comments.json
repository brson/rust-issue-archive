Am I doing something wrong here??)\n\nI've implemented nearly all of your suggestions, with two exceptions:\n- I left `with_wrapper` intact. I had considered deprecating or taking it out, but I'd rather save that for a library stabilization pass.\n- I did not add experimental markings, since I think the feature gate on default type parameters suffices.\n",

    "body": "> (which github seems to've dropped completely after a force-push? I thought it kept the old comments around... Am I doing something wrong here??)\n\nOh oops, my fault. I must've commented on the commit directly, not the PR-wide \"files changed\" view (I try to avoid doing that for exactly this reason). Commit comments are dropped with a force push, but comments on that view just become \"outdated ...\". You can get the old comments if you have the old hash of that commit (via `https://github.com/aturon/rust/commit/$hash`), or, I guess, via the emails/notifications github gave you for my comments).\n\nThose two exceptions sound fine to me.\n",
