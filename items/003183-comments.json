    "body": "Yeah, it's _possible_ cache split load/stores are magnifying the effect, or penalizing later stack segments by (f.e.) making them not be 64-byte aligned (or whatever the line size is, and presumably whatever LLVM assumes its frames are). But honestly I think the main thing is just that we're hitting cases where recursive code either bottoms out within a stack chunk or thrashes back-and-forth over the edge of one.\n\nTo fix this more-long-term I'd like to try moving to a single chunk size (== OS page size) and keeping the pages in a per-task freelist. This will work nicely with the mostly-copying GC that pcwalton's suggesting we play with too: the task can share a single task-local page freelist between stack and GC uses. The only additional check we'd need in that case is for larger-than-a-page-sized allocations / stack frames, which we can service from a slower malloc path (and should be rare). Should also solve any potential mismatches between LLVM-assumed alignment of the stack and where we start each frame.\n",
