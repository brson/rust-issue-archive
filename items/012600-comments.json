    "body": "+1 to all of what Niko said.  In particular, I do like the sugar being suggested here.  But at the same time, I noticed that in a [recent rust-dev post](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-February/008798.html), @anasazi used the notation `Self<T>` to apply a hypothetical higher-kinded `Self : * -> *` to a type parameter.  If we wanted to leave such options open for the future, it may constrains how we use/abuse `Self` now.  (But as niko said, the role of `Self` in trait definitions may not be relevant to its role in impls.)\n",
