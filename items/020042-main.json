  "body": "This commit performs a second pass for stabilization over the `std::ptr` module.\nThe specific actions taken were:\n- The `RawPtr` trait was renamed to `PtrExt`\n- The `RawMutPtr` trait was renamed to `PtrMutExt`\n- The module name `ptr` is now stable.\n- These functions were all marked `#[stable]` with no modification:\n  - `null`\n  - `null_mut`\n  - `swap`\n  - `replace`\n  - `read`\n  - `write`\n  - `PtrExt::is_null`\n  - `PtrExt::is_not_null`\n  - `PtrExt::offset`\n- These functions remain unstable:\n  - `as_ref`, `as_mut` - the return value of an `Option` is not fully expressive\n                       as null isn't the only bad value, and it's unclear\n                       whether we want to commit to these functions at this\n                       time. The reference/lifetime semantics as written are\n                       also problematic in how they encourage arbitrary\n                       lifetimes.\n  - `zero_memory` - This function is currently not used at all in the\n                  distribution, and in general it plays a broader role in the\n                  \"working with unsafe pointers\" story. This story is not yet\n                  fully developed, so at this time the function remains\n                  unstable for now.\n  - `read_and_zero` - This function remains unstable for largely the same\n                    reasons as `zero_memory`.\n- These functions are now all deprecated:\n  - `PtrExt::null` - call `ptr::null` or `ptr::null_mut` instead.\n  - `PtrExt::to_uint` - use an `as` expression instead.\n",
