    "body": "@sfackler explained how my examples were ambiguous and I have used his explanation/examples to revise the example below. @thestinger, his explanation also also explained your comments which I didn't understand before.\n\n``` rust\n// A `type` which forms a total order is completely sortable\n// `i32` forms a Total Order\nlet _entirelySortable = [1i32, -1, 7, 3, 5, 9]; // Sortable because `i32` is\n\n// `f32` does not form a Total Order\nlet _partiallySortable1 = [1.0f32, -1.0, 7.0, std::f32::NAN];\n// NAN's sorting order is undefined making this `type` unsortable\n// (Is NAN before or after 3?)\n\n// Still unsortable because `f32` supports NAN\nlet _partiallySortable2 = [1.0f32, -1.0, 7.0, 14.2]; // Also, not a total order\n```\n\nMy issue with the [Ord](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) page is without understanding _Total order_, it's difficult to know what it's talking about without thinking through that math example. If you look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15217 where they assume people don't know the `[from,to)` range notation, I think it's safe to assume the same people won't immediately translate (which is much harder than understanding the range notation by the way):\n\n> An order is a total order if it is (for all a, b and c):\n> - total and antisymmetric: exactly one of a < b, a == b or a > b is true; and\n> - transitive, a < b and b < c implies a < c. The same must hold for both == and >.\n\nInto: \"Ah! This type has one unique sorting order with no exceptions! Obviously, if there is an exception, I have to use [PartialOrd](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) instead\". The definition is certainly precise but it should be more readable (or have an example). Also, the range notation is much simpler and obvious once you know it.\n\nThe issue with [PartialOrd](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) is that knowing what to use it for depends on knowing what _Ord_ cannot be used for. I think making Ord more readable would be helpful. I grouped them together because they are related and an example in one could possibly be duplicated in the other because it is probably still pertinent.\n\n[EDIT]\nNot arguing that Rust should cater to those who don't understand `[from, to)` notation. Just trying to point out that it's a little cryptic.\n",
