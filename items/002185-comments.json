    "body": "I minimized the test case a tiny bit: https://gist.github.com/2466203\n\nI'm seeing some behavior in `trans::impl::trans_monomorphized_callee` that looks weird to me. The actual ICE occurs in `base:make_mono_id` because for the `iter` method of the `iter::iterable` iface, `bounds` has length 1 and `substs` has length 2. It seems wrong to me that there would be two elements in `substs`: `iter` has one ty param, that is, the ty param of its parent iface. By inserting print statements into `trans_monomorphized_callee`, I noticed that `ty_substs` has length 2 in this case (and that's the list that eventually becomes the `substs` argument of `make_mono_id`). That looks wrong as well, so I'm suspicious about the line of code in  `trans_monomorphized_callee` that computes `ty_substs`. `impl_substs` appears to be correct here (the impl of `iterable` for type `fn@(fn(uint))` does indeed introduce one subst, `uint` for `A`), but I'm not sure why `node_substs` also maps to `[uint]`.\n\nAnyway, @marijnh said he would look at this further.\n",
