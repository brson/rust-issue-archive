    "body": "FWIW, I've come across two other pieces of work on exhaustiveness checking in pattern matching which may be relevant here. Note that I haven't actually _read_ them or investigated very deeply; just to note that they exist and perhaps bring them to others' attention.\n\nOne is [this blog post by Neel Krishnawami](http://semantic-domain.blogspot.hu/2012/08/pattern-compilation-made-easy.html), which begins: \n\n> One of the most practically useful features of functional programming languages is pattern matching, and one of the most important quality-of-implementation features for an implementation is the exhaustiveness checking for pattern matches. In this post, I will give the simplest algorithm for coverage checking that I know.\n\nLater on, it contains the sentence:\n\n> The fifth rule handles the void type. It just succeeds, since there are no patterns of empty type! \n\nwhich suggests that this algorithm properly takes account of uninhabited (void) types. (Again though, I haven't taken time to understand the algorithm.)\n\nThe other is [a paper called \"GADTs meet their match\"](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/pattern-matching/gadtpm.pdf). This is less obviously relevant - there is no explicit mention of uninhabited types - but given that one of the chief challenges of pattern matches with GADTs is accurately determining which cases are actually impossible due to their types, it seems like the problems and solutions might at least be something similar.\n",

This is important for backwards-compatibility but also because I think code like this:\n\n``` rust\nlet res: Result<T, E> = ...;\nmatch res {\n    Ok(t) => ...,\n    Err(e) => ...,\n}\n```\n\nshould be allowed to compile even when `E` (or `T`) is uninhabited.
