  "body": "A total ordering is assumed and required for most generic functions\nmaking use of these traits. The `cmp` method also provides a boost in\nefficiency for sorting sequence types or storing them in a tree set/map\nsince otherwise two passes would often be required.\n\nThe standard hardware comparison operators for floats do not implement a\ntotal order. However, IEEE754 does define an alternate total ordering.\nFixing this is now issue #12434 and doesn't need to stand in the way of\na sane comparison module.\n\nTraits like `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` could exist, but will never\npermit a sane implementation. A type implementing `Eq` would be expected\nto automatically implement `PartialEq` but floating point types have\n_two_ comparison definitions available. I don't think these would see\nmuch usage anyway, because there are even alternate definitions of\nfunctions as simple as `min`, `max` and `clamp` for floats.\n\nCloses #5283\nCloses #8071\nCloses #10320\n",
