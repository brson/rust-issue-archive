    "body": "Upon some more discussion, I don't think that this is the fix that we want.\n\nThis would indeed allow us to cut down the size of executables, but the key point is that it only helps _LTO_ executables. At some point, we get to the area of diminishing returns and this is breaching into that territory. The main complaint is that the default executable is large, not that LTO executables are too large.\n\nI don't think there's enough bang for our buck with this solution, it simply requires too many workarounds to get this working and I don't believe that the benefit is that great.\n",
