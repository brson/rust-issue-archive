The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @steveklabnik (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "- I can understand the will to use popular terms, but the problem is that one _gigabyte_ is 10^9 bytes.\n- I made an incorrect assumption, sorry about that. This feature is probably only available in pandoc's variant of Markdown. I tried to build _trpl_ only but I couldn't find the appropriate target: there's a _docs_ target but it builds the whole documentation and seems to take ages to complete.\n\nSince there's multiple ways of fixing the off-by-one error, I think I would rather create an issue for this and let the Rust team decide on how to address it.\n",
