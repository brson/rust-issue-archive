    "body": "@steveklabnik there are a family of potential problems that are flagged in the reddit discussion.  Here are the ones that I can identify with a quick skim:\n- The original poster did not see that the syntax `&x` within the closure's arguments was a pattern binding that performs a dereference of the input,\n- The fact that the closure itself takes a reference as input _might_ be obscured by the fact that the closure doesn't have an explicit type signature (at least, that was one of huon's theories in his comment),\n- brson interpreted the discussion as a sign that drawing an analogy between `match` and the arguments to a `fn` could be helpful.  (But `!kibwen`'s comment points out that the patterns for `fn` arguments need to be irrefutable, which is an important distinction and thus I am not 100% sure an analogy with `match` will help.)\n\nI'm not sure if this particular ticket is actionable on its own.\n\nI would want to make sure that the guide covers the fact that `&x` means one thing in expression context (namely, \"make a reference to the l-value `x`\") and another thing in pattern context (namely, \"dereference the input and bind the resulting value to `x`\").  We cannot put that into the \"Variable bindings\" section of the current guide, since that precedes the section on \"Pointers\", but maybe just make sure that there is a TODO in the \"Pointers\" section that ensures we cover the distinction between an `&x` expression and an `&x` pattern.\n",
