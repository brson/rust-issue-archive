    "body": "Oh turns out I didn't fix it with that commit. So here's some more investigation (assuming your file is called `foo.rs`). This was done after #7125 is applied, which removes force-running particular optimizations (independent of what's specified otherwise, allowing a more controlled environment).\n\nWith no optimizations, the JIT code runs just fine\n\n```\n$ ./x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc -Z jit ./foo.rs       \n-1\n```\n\nWith run with optimizations, the code doesn't pass\n\n```\n$ ./x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc -Z jit -O ./foo.rs       \n1\n```\n\nWith run with some optimizations, the code doesn't pass differently\n\n```\n$ ./x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc -Z jit --passes instcombine,scalarrepl-ssa ./foo.rs       \nNaN\n```\n\n@aatch, you recently did some work with LLVM passes, right? Do you know if these passes could combine to create different code? Also, I'm not sure if LLVM has a pass to dump the module, but it'd be awesome to be able to dump the LLVM bytecode between each pass (by the way, it's awesome just specifying the passes on the command line!).\n\nIf we keep the optimizations, we're probably generating code that LLVM isn't expecting, so it's optimizing it away from what we want. Why it's only doing this in the JIT though is a bit baffling...\n",

Now running with `-O` still runs the `always-inline` pass, so this would imply that when the `always-inline` pass isn't run, the code produces the wrong result. However I tried a few permutations on the code above and `always-inline,instcombine` produces `NaN`.\n\nAgain though, this only shows up when using the JIT.\n",
