    "body": "One alternate thing we can do if you want fairer scheduling is to run in a not-yet-implemented thread-per-task (or maybe more like scheduler-per-task) mode. It would cost some in context switching but you would get much better scheduling.\n\nAdditionally, we should be able to execute the schedulers themselves on segmented stacks. On Linux at least this would likely perform and scale amazingly well.\n",
