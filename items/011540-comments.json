    "body": "I don't think it is accurate to see the second example as implicit copies.\n\n(If those were really copies, then you'd be able to pass `y` twice into a hypothetical program like:\n\n``` rust\nfn bar(c: &mut int, d: &mut int) { ... }\nbar(y, y);\n```\n\nbut that would be wrong since it would introduce aliasing.)\n\nI think the right mental model for the second example is that `y` (or rather `*y`) is implicitly _reborrowed_. That is, the two `foo` calls are sugar for the following:\n\n``` rust\nfoo(&mut *y);\nfoo(&mut *y);\n```\n\n(I think some of the proposals we've discussed in recent memory would force the programmer to write the above unsugared form explicitly; but the team has not come to any conclusions about whether that would do more harm than good.)\n\nI don't know if this distinction in terminology will help clear this up, but to my mind it makes it clearer that there are distinct borrows (with distinct non-overlapping scopes) occurring here, not arbitrary copies.\n\nIn fact, if you attempt to write out the `bar` example I just gave, you get an error about borrowing `*y` as mutable, _not_ about copying:\n\n```\n% cat /tmp/g.rs\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = 1;\n    let y = &mut x;\n    fn bar(b: &mut int, c: &mut int) {*b += 0; *c += 0; }\n    bar(y, y);\n}\n% rustc /tmp/g.rs\n/tmp/g.rs:5:11: 5:12 error: cannot borrow `*y` as mutable more than once at a time\n/tmp/g.rs:5     bar(y, y);\n                       ^\n/tmp/g.rs:5:8: 5:9 note: previous borrow of `*y` as mutable occurs here\n/tmp/g.rs:5     bar(y, y);\n                    ^\nerror: aborting due to previous error\ntask 'rustc' failed at 'explicit failure', /Users/fklock/Dev/Mozilla/rust.git/src/libsyntax/diagnostic.rs:102\ntask '<main>' failed at 'explicit failure', /Users/fklock/Dev/Mozilla/rust.git/src/librustc/lib.rs:443\n```\n\n---\n\nOnce you see your second example as performing implicit reborrows, then one sees that one must write your first example to use explicit reborrows instead of attempting to make copies, e.g. via something like this:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    struct T<'a> {i: int, j: &'a mut int}\n    let mut x = 1;\n    let y = T{i: 0, j: &mut x};\n    fn foo(T{i: a, j: b}: T) {*b += a;}\n    foo(T{ j: &mut *y.j, ..y});\n    foo(T{ j: &mut *y.j, ..y});\n}\n```\n\nor, again making use of implicit reborrows:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    struct T<'a> {i: int, j: &'a mut int}\n    let mut x = 1;\n    let y = T{i: 0, j: &mut x};\n    fn foo(T{i: a, j: b}: T) {*b += a;}\n    foo(T{ j: y.j, ..y});\n    foo(T{ j: y.j, ..y});\n}\n```\n",
