Why bother with declaring twice something that can be declared only once? \n\nBy making it clear that this is required in the linking process, this decision makes much more sense. People coming from C wouldn't complain that much if they knew this is similar to their beloved \"-l\" linker argument.\n\nBy the way, I don't know if that really makes sense, but I've seen a lot of in-crate `link-args` wouldn't it be more convenient to use `extern \"C\" mod {foo, bar};` or `link \"C\" crate {foo, bar};` to link C libs to the current crate instead of `#[link-args=\"-lfoo,-lbar\"]`?\n",

But that is very different from removing any way to express this linkage directive, which is what this ticket is describing.  (That's just me echo'ing [strcat's comment](#issuecomment-33315435) that we should keep the ticket's topic on track.)\n\n(One big reason that I do not like the idea of inferring external linkage from the existing uses of `use` is that I think it will lead in the common case to cryptic compiler error messages, or worse, outright linkage mistakes, in response to user typos.)\n",

Compiler should first try to make sure that `a::b::c` is really resides in \"local module\" x. If yes, it's a local module. If not, then it must be considered as an \"external crate\" x, and compiler do some checks, and add an `extern mod x` automatically.
