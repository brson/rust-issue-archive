    "body": "Copying my comment from #14481 for posterity:\n\n---\n\nI'm not keen on the Add impl for string. It seems to easily encourage inefficient/overallocating code since it doesn't reuse the allocation of its argument, meaning s = s + a is horrible (especially in a loop). (And I relatively often see code approximately equivalent to that.)\n\nI would be very interested in waiting a little longer to see if not having it is just too unbearable.\n\n(Also this addition on strings isn't even commutative, i.e. it flies in the face of mathematical convention for the + operator. :P )\n",

    "body": "Theoretically we could actually just have `Add` take everything by-value and implement it like\n\n``` rust\nimpl<'a,'b> Add<&'b BigInt, BigInt> for &'a BigInt {\n    fn add(self, other: &'b BigInt) -> BigInt { ... }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, (with current-Rust) this would mean that `a + b` desugaring to just `a.add(b)` would require it to be called like `&bigint + &bigint` for types that take by reference (but all the primitives would be fine with by-value and so they would not require references).\n",
