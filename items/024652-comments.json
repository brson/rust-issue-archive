    "body": "@alexcrichton I don't think going from IP to `u32` and back is uncommon. Any computation on an IP needs it to be converted to an int. If the stdlib does not have methods to do that, all consumer libs will need to write those methods. An example is a small crate I've been writing https://github.com/achanda/ipnetwork/blob/master/src/ipnetwork.rs#L52-L61\nThe reverse conversion is necessary to display results in a human readable form. Also, if both of these conversions are done on the same machine, endianness should not be a problem. Serializing this data, and potentially sending to another machine can be an issue though. But that is not in scope of this module. Thoughts?\n\n@nagisa thanks for pointing out I can use an IP in the browser, pretty cool!\n",
