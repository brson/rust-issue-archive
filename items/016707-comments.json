    "body": "For reference, this is the behavior of Java, C, and C++. But C# yields an error when this is done.\n\nJava in particular documents Math.abs on ints to be:\n\n> Returns the absolute value of an int value. If the argument is not negative, the argument is returned. If the argument is negative, the negation of the argument is returned.\n> \n> Note that if the argument is equal to the value of Integer.MIN_VALUE, the most negative representable int value, the result is that same value, which is negative. \n\nWhile C# simply states that the input is:\n\n> A number that is greater than Int64.MinValue, but less than or equal to Int64.MaxValue.\n\nA third alternative exists in making the output of min be the _unsigned_ version of the input, which should be possible with associated types. You can actually do this today with `std::int::MIN.abs() as uint`. However I think this solution is generally not well accepted.\n",
