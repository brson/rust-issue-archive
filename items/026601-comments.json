For now, however, I wanted to land the initial support to get everything working initially and then later we can perhaps fill out these kinds of functions on-demand. In general I think that the support for XP will be available, but it won't be a 1st tier platform, so if some bits here and there aren't as fully implemented as they could be it's not the end of the world\n",
