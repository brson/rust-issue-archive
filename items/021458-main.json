  "body": "The base64 support can be trivially removed (there are no in-tree users) and the regex support is a whopping 4k lines of code to maintain for a few non-critical uses in-tree. This commit migrates all current users in-tree away from regexes to custom matching code.\n\nThe most critical application affected by this migration is that the testing framework no longer considers filter arguments as regexes, but rather just a substring matching. It is expected that more featureful testing frameworks can evolve outside of the in-tree libtest version over time which can properly depend on libregex from crates.io.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
