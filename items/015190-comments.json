    "body": "I'm all for burning down backcompat-lang issues, but this seems very close to the category of \"closing a bug to close a bug,\" as in this doesn't seem to actually fix the problem. \n\nThis is continuing to paste over how `proc` apparently needs an audit in its implementation, and we're likely to continue finding issues like #14036 until this is done. I'm worried about hastily doing this when it's clear that there's a larger underlying issues that's just being dodged in this one case for now.\n\nI would imagine that this _should_ fall out of implementing unboxed closures, so it may not be super pressing to actually fix now. It would be nice for the PR message to mention this. For example, this comment:\n\n> Since procs do not have lifetime bounds, we must do this to maintain\n> safety.\n\nseems to not be correct. There is no fundamental reason why a boxed once closure (proc) shouldn't be able to capture references and have lifetime bounds. The mentioned issue here merely states that the analysis involved with `proc()` is akin to `~once fn()` which was never quite working anyway.\n\nI suppose that I would simply rather the commit message to state that this is pasting over a very real and plausible use case that we are just not supporting right now, but it is planned to support it in the future.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton `proc` is going away anyway in favor of unboxed closures. There's no reason to spend a lot of time adding support for lifetimes to proc (which requires higher-rank lifetimes to do properly!) when we're going to remove the feature soon anyway. I would rather just do this to close the bug and defer the remaining work to #15067, which we should promote to P-backcompat-lang.\n",
