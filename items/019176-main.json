  "body": "This is an initial pass at stabilizing the `iter` module. The module is\nfairly large, but is also pretty polished, so most of the stabilization\nleaves things as they are.\n\nSome changes:\n- Due to the new object safety rules, various traits needs to be split\n  into object-safe traits and extension traits. This includes `Iterator`\n  itself. While splitting up the traits adds some complexity, it will\n  also increase flexbility: once we have automatic impls of `Trait` for\n  trait objects over `Trait`, then things like the iterator adapters\n  will all work with trait objects.\n- Iterator adapters that use up the entire iterator now take it by\n  value, which makes the semantics more clear and helps catch bugs. Due\n  to the splitting of Iterator, this does not affect trait objects. If\n  the underlying iterator is still desired for some reason, `by_ref` can\n  be used. (Note: this change had no fallout in the Rust distro except\n  for the useless mut lint.)\n- In general, extension traits new and old are following an [in-progress\n  convention](rust-lang/rfcs#445). As such, they\n  are marked `unstable`.\n- As usual, anything involving closures is `unstable` pending unboxed\n  closures.\n- A few of the more esoteric/underdeveloped iterator forms (like\n  `RandomAccessIterator` and `MutableDoubleEndedIterator`, along with\n  various unfolds) are left experimental for now.\n- The `order` submodule is left `experimental` because it will hopefully\n  be replaced by generalized comparison traits.\n- \"Leaf\" iterators (like `Repeat` and `Counter`) are uniformly\n  constructed by free fns at the module level. That's because the types\n  are not otherwise of any significance (if we had `impl Trait`, you\n  wouldn't want to define a type at all).\n\nCloses #17701\n\nDue to renamings and splitting of traits, this is a:\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
