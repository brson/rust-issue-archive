    "body": "OK, I finished the review. Very nice work. r+ given that comments are addressed and the following tests are added:\n1. A compile-fail test checking that coercion from a variable of `fn()` type fails to coerce to a closure and fails to coerce to a proc. (name it someting like `coerce-bare-fn-to-closure-and-proc.rs`)\n2. run-pass tests covering coercion from fn items, variant constructors, and tuple structs. I'd be particularly interested to see tests for generic fns and the cross-crate case as well (iiuc, this results in generating a wrapper in the second crate, not the crate where the struct is actually defined, right?).\n\nSorry it took me some time! A lot of changes here, but good stuff to be sure.\n",

    "body": "Seems I broke the test for #6919 (though it didn't actually fail locally - maybe it never ran as part of `make check-stage1-rpass`).\n\nThe issue is with a public `static` coercing a private bare fn to a closure in a crate. When the `static` is used from another crate, it's recreated.\nPreviously, the bare fn was kept alive by the `static` (in the first crate), now only the bare-fn-to-closure wrapper is kept alive.\nAnd when the `static` is recreated in another crate, it's recreating the wrapper, which references the function from the first crate, which is no longer kept alive, so we get a linker error.\n\nI am not sure how to solve this, short of a wrapper cache mapping bare function symbol names to wrapper symbol names, exported in crate metadata, but that's a bit excessive, I would say.\n",
