    "body": "This bug is too vague; it needs an example to illustrate what the desired original Rust source expression is.\n\n---\n\nIts also possible that this bug has been fixed; or at least, my attempt to create an example to illustrate the bug has failed  Here is the example I devised:\n\n``` rust\nstatic x : [int, ..2] = [3, 4];\nstatic y : [libc::c_char, ..2] = [97, 98];\n\nunsafe fn aref<T>(a: *T, offset: uint) -> T {\n    let ptr : uint = (a as uint) + sys::size_of::<T>() * offset;\n    let ptr : *T   = ptr as *T;\n    *ptr\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    static px : *int = &x as *int;\n    static py : *libc::c_char = &y as *libc::c_char;\n    let vx0, vx1, vy0, vy1;\n    unsafe {\n        vx0 = aref(px, 0);\n        vx1 = aref(px, 1);\n        vy0 = aref(py, 0);\n        vy1 = aref(py, 1);\n    }\n    io::println(fmt!(\"x[0]: %d x[1]: %d\", vx0, vx1));\n    io::println(fmt!(\"y[0]: %c y[1]: %c\", vy0 as char, vy1 as char));\n}\n```\n\nbut note that this compiles and runs successfully.  So either I misunderstand how to exercise const expressions (which is quite possible), or this bug has been fixed.\n\n@jdm feel free to reopen if you have a concrete example to illustrate the issue.\n",
