We seem to have been generally following the clang/gcc patterns, but we have pushback for consolidating them (#7791).\n\nOne thing I also forgot to mention is how crates link together. If I disable relocatable code, can I generate a dynamic library? Also, if one rlib has no relocatable code, and mine does, can I link to it? In general I think we want to give errors before running the linker. I'm unsure of how all these modes play together, so I'm fine with merging and seeing how this all plays out.\n",
