    "body": "Rust strings aren't nul-terminated by default, so looking for a zero byte with a loop like that won't work, this code is hence undefined behaviour (the `offset`s are running off the end of the strings in memory) and its just random chance that the output is so close to what you expect. You can see the output change if you compile with optimisations (one good indicator of undefined behaviour).\n\nThe fix is to instead not rely on a nul-terminator, or make sure it is there (e.g. using `CStr` or `CString` in `std::ffi` or even manually putting a `\\0` in the literal).\n\nThanks for filing, but this isn't a Rust bug, so I'm closing.\n",
