    "body": "Other guidelines welcome. I find it difficult to draw a line here. I don't want to have a full shell language in here, but it feels like crates are a \"natural\" place to do _some_ configuration-management logic. Maybe just conditionalizing by #[cfg()] will be enough. It's almost certain that any real build will have a CM system _outside_ the crate as well, invoking rustc. But huge and non-obvious compiler-argument lists are something from the C world I hope to avoid.\n\nMaybe if the interface between outside CMs and inside rustc is always just \"a list of cfg variables\" and you can pass that in a file, that's adequate?\n\nPerhaps give rustc a --cfg-file=<filename> option. And/or the ability to override with -D foo=bar for cases where you have something against using config files?\n",
