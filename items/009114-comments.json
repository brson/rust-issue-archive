The relevant question here is should we fail for unimplemented behavior or just do nothing? Personally, I'd rather factor it out so it's not even possible to call unimplemented methods. I think I'm going to create a new issue to discuss this in general. We should probably wait on this PR until we have a consensus.\n",
