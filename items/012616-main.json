  "body": "I've been playing around with code size when linking to libstd recently, and these were some findings I found that really helped code size. I started out by eliminating all I/O implementations from libnative and instead just return an unimplemented error.\n\nIn doing so, a `fn main() {}` executable was ~378K before this patch, and about 170K after the patch. These size wins are all pretty minor, but they all seemed pretty reasonable to me. With native I/O not stubbed out, this takes the size of an LTO executable from 675K to 400K.\n",
