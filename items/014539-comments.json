    "body": "OK, this is ready for initial review. There are several known problems, but I figured as this patch is over 1KLOC already it's best to fix them in followups. Known issues:\n- Some stuff may be broken cross-crate.\n- Trans fails with an assertion if you don't specify the return type on the closure. Probably a simple writeback issue.\n- Only `FnMut` is implemented, not `Fn` or `FnOnce` (again, probably not hard of a fix).\n- You have to explicitly call the closure with `.call_mut()` instead of using the `()` operator (probably the largest remaining work item).\n- Complex destructors on unboxed closures are untested and may be hilariously broken.\n\nThis patch includes simple unit tests for direct calls, calls through a generic type parameter, and boxed calls.\n\nr? @nikomatsakis (or whoever)\n",

    "body": "Current status: I have rebased the patch and addressed about half of @nikomatsakis' comments. However, this collided badly with the other unboxed closures work, necessitating some extra functionality. Specifically, I need to add tupling and untupling machinery in several places in trans in order to keep the tests passing, as they call the traits by name and implement them manually.\n\nI think that, semantically, @eddyb had the right idea all along: exposing the tupling/untupling is pretty messy, as is the `rust-call` ABI that I had to add. The elegant solution is to say that `Fn`/`FnMut`/`FnOnce` are actually an _unbounded family_ of traits, only nameable via the `|int| -> int` syntax. I think that it may well be the case that the lang items should be marked experimental and behind a feature gate forever (unless we get variadic generics, I guess). The guts of the implementation are pretty gross in places, and I want to confine this ugliness to the implementation and not expose it as part of the real semantics of the language.\n\n@eddyb, you are perfectly within your rights to say \"I told you so\". :)\n",
