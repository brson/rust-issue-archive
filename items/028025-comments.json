This is probably a reason why `dylib` emits both `.lib` and `.dll` at once. `.exp` [appears to have a similar purpose](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/se8y7dcs.aspx).\n\n`.a` should probably be `.lib`, but then it is ambiguous in case of flag like `--crate-type=staticlib,dylib` which should produce both and if we try to emit `.lib` in both cases, we will simply either not emit the static library, or emit an useless dynamic library.\n",

I don't really know the cause, I use Linux or ssh into a Linux box when I'm on my Surface (my only windows machine) and thus aren't familiar with MSVC's conventions. Whatever the real issue, the test is failing, so I just made the test a no-op on MSVC and filed this issue.\n",
