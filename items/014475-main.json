  "body": "When viewing a specific type, rustdoc currently spreads out information about the applicable methods, arranging them by trait and including documentation per method.\n\nWhile this is an important view to have, it would often be very useful to see a single summary list of method signatures that apply to a given type. Something close to what you see currently when you view a trait.\n\nThese methods could be listed as a separate summary section, or through some kind of slide out (see the \"synopsis\" button at http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.10.9.2/docs/Data-Vector.html for example). They can be hyperlinks to more detailed documentation.\n",
