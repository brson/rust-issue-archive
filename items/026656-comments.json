    "body": "Hmm, so I don't think that the problem has to do with `Trigger<B>: 'static` requiring that `B: 'static` per se, though I suppose it might help with the problem. Rather, it seems to be a flaw in the \"parametricity\" argument -- that is, today, we consider the definition of drop \"uninteresting\" if `B` does not have any bounds, with the intention of screening out code that treats instances of B opaquely. But we overlooked closures or trait objects that may consume a B instance and which (hence) \"encapsulate\" bounds. That's...pretty unfortunate.\n",

    "body": "After thinking on this last night, I laid it out in my head this way. There is a properly very similar to variance, let's call it \"`Type` _may access_ `X`\" where `X` is one of the type parameters declared on `Type`. It indicates whether having access to a `Type<Foo>` potentially lets you manipulate the contents of `Foo`. This can be inferred in a global way just as variance can be inferred by setting up various constraints. The bottom line is what kind of data is reachable through `Type`.\n\nFor convenience, we also write `T<...,U,...>`  _may access_ `U` to mean `T` _may access_ `V` where `V` is the type parameter for which `U` is being substituted.\n\nGiven some type declared like `struct Type<..., X, ...>` (possibly with where clauses):\n- If `Type` has where-clauses that reference `X`, then `Type` _may access_ `X`. \n- If the definition of `Type` contains a field `f: T` where `T` contains (somewhere) `Type1<..., X, ...>`, and  `Type1<...X...>` _may access_ `X`, then `Type` _may access_ `X`.\n\nIn addition there are some ground rules:\n- `fn(..., X, ...)` _may access_ `X`\n- `Trait<...X,...>` _may access_ `X` \n\nNow the dropck can use these rules to decide when it should enforce stricter rules. In particular, if an lvalue of type `T<U>` is being dropped at exit from `'a`, and `T<U>` _may access_ `U`, then `U` must strictly outlive `'a`. Or something like that, I have to review how the dropck rules are formulated exactly. But you get the idea.\n\nThe key point is that this property _may access_ is independent from whether a value has a destructor. The intution is \"if a destructor got ahold of a value of type `T<...U...>`, could it wind up dereferencing pointers in `U`?\"\n",

This is preserved by normal selection (as it can't dig into the dead type and find the dead lifetime), but trait objects (and equivalently, instantiations of generic functions) can \"refer to\" an impl that witnesses the liveness of the lifetime, and should be treated as such.\n",

    "body": "It took me a while to understand why trait objects even help in circumventing dropck... my current conclusion is that in `Zook::Drop`, Rust actually can assume that `B: Button` because we have something of type `Box<Trigger<B>>` around, which can only be well-formed if `B: Button`. In other words, the source of the problem is the fact that there are many ways to get a trait bound into a function, not just the annotation at the `impl` and `fn`. So, it's _not_ the case that parametricity is not good enough - rather, _checking_ the precondition of parametricitiy (that no assumptions are made about the type) turns out to be harder than expected.\nWould that be a fair summary of this issue?\n\nEDIT: I also wonder how Rust chooses the lifetime for `B` in `main`.  Obviously, that lifetime is only the block suffix starting at `&ticking`, but that means that in the two lines before this block suffix, we have a type in scope that contains a lifetime that didn't even start yet?\n\nEDIT2: Coming back to my point above: Rust only assumes `B: Button` in `drop` when we call `trigger.fire`. If we call `button.push` directly instead, even though we can derive `B: Button` via the `Box` type, the compiler doesn't actually notice that it has this implicit bound around.\n",

    "body": "@RalfJung my go-to example when thinking about this is a struct that carries both some object and a callback on that object:\n\n``` rust\nstruct S<T> { x: Option<T>, f: fn (T) }\n```\n\nTo my mind, `S` is definitely parametric with respect to `T`.  Given an `s: S` and with no further knowledge of the particular `T`, there is nothing one can do with `s.x` except 1. swap in a `None` instead, and/or 2. call `s.f` with the contents of `s.x`, if any are present.\n\nThe above properties are not violations of parametricity.  (it is what I see as a _celebration_ of parametricity: it allows one to make very strong statements about what clients can do with instances of `S` if they do not introduce bounds on `T`.)\n\nWith our current buggy dropck, however, one is allowed to pass the `s.x` into `s.f`, yet there is no strictly-outlives relationship enforced between the `S` and any references within the `s.x`.\n- Here is a full example illustrating this for the `S` above: http://is.gd/vqx1OV\n- _This_ is why I have been saying that \"parametricity is necessary but not sufficient.\"\n- We need a stronger check, that ensures that we only allow the weaker region relations on parameter types `T` that can be proven do not flow into any \"negative positions\" (e.g. function arguments).  Positive positions are okay since those can only create instances of `T`, they cannot consume the one we have in hand.\n",

    "body": "Right. And this can be fixed (after @nikomatsakis's patch) by making `fn` a dropck type (potentially in the same as trait objects). \n\nOn the other hand, ordinary parametricity isn't really the important condition for dropck. Rust code is always perfectly parametric about lifetimes. One theoretical way to make dropck work with specialization is to change the \"vtables\" during destruction, C++-style, which is basically a gaping violating of parametricity. Even without that, you can safely:\n- have control-flow dependencies on everything you want. This includes branching on \"empty\" traits (e.g. `Send`, `Sized`, `Copy` given `Clone`, etc.).\n- even more strongly, get `'static` data on everything you want.\n- invert impls. For example, after you branch on your `Option<T ~ &'\u03b1 [$0]>`, if you know that `T: IntoIterator` and that there are no blanket impls for `IntoIterator` (yay orphan rules), you can safely downcast `T` to a `&'\u03b1 [$0]` with a fresh lifetime, as the reference must have been live for the impl to be available.\n",

I'm not sure if [code here](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=bde02195e23fc98ac16442be721fe6f8) could prove the point.  \r\nif it could, it seems beyond the cases ( closures or trait objects) mentioned by @nikomatsakis since the evail `bar` impl does not\r\nintroduce or \"encapsulate\" any bound, therefore we have to dropck on T when Foo\\<T\\> is dropped in case of the UB introduced here.\r\n\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Rather, it seems to be a flaw in the \"parametricity\" argument -- that is, today, we consider the definition of drop \"uninteresting\" if `B` does not have any bounds, with the intention of screening out code that treats instances of B opaquely. But we overlooked closures or trait objects that may consume a B instance and which (hence) \"encapsulate\" bounds. That's...pretty unfortunate.\r\n\r\nSage insights are appreciated.",
