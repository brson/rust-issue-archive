    "body": "\"Teach the task API to allow spawning a task with a fixed stack size\" is done. I started implementing \"Add the ability to query stack size from LLVM. This lets us implement stack guard zones precisely\" but ran into limitations of LLVM's pass infrastructure, and didn't feel like putting in the effort to continuing. I'm still fond of a separate post-trans static analysis of fixed stack size. One possibility is also using attributes to tag function pointers with a \"maximum stack size\", so that indirection can still be used, albeit with this limitation.\n",

    "body": "Over time I've softened on adding a feature such as this. Segmented stacks unquestionably hurts our portability because LLVM does not have segmented stacks implemented for all platforms. In the light of that, I believe that there is likely a compromise to be made here. \n\nThe best of all worlds would be that we don't require segmented stack support in LLVM (allowing us to be more portable), but it's unclear how easily we can get there. Until that date comes, it seems inevitable that we need something such as this.\n\nAs for dealing with this specifically, I have a few preferences with how I may want it to be changed:\n1. No-split-stack crates should not be able to link against split-stack crates (and vice versa).\n2. This may want to be a `-Z` option instead of `-C` because it is an implementation detail that is subject to change in the future (we may not have `-C no-split-stacks` for all time).\n",
