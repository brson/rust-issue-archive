    "body": "@kwantam: Moving the comments off the outdated commit. Yes, I was hoping that we could do what we did for `char::width()` and make it deprecated and point at this `unicode-xid` crate. By the way, I don't really know much about unicode, so if there's a more appropriate name for this then I'd be happy to change it. I originally had it as `unicode-derived-property`, but it turns out I think we have all the other derived properties exposed as stable `char` methods.\n\nOn making rustc dependent on crates.io, I haven't heard of any plans going in that direction. I do think though that it's a little dangerous that we have these internal and external crates diverging from one another. We should probably shift over to using git submodules to pull those packages in to rust-proper.\n",
