  "body": "r? @nikomatsakis In #6319, several people mentioned they ran into a \"computing\nfictitious type\" ICE in trans. This turns out to be because some\nof my recent changes to typeck::check::_match resulted in type errors\ngetting reported with ty_err as the expected type, which meant the errors\nwere suppressed, and typechecking incorrectly succeeded (since the errors\nweren't recorded).\n\nChanged the error messages in these cases not to use an expected type at all,\nrather, printing out a string describing the type that was expected (which is\nwhat the code originally did). The result is a bit repetitive and the\nproliferation of error-reporting functions in typeck::infer is a bit annoying,\nbut I thought it was important to fix this now; more cleanup can happen later.\n",
