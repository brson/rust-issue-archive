  "body": "This commit replaces the in-tree liblibc with the [external clone](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/libc) which has no evolved beyond the in-tree version in light of its [recent redesign](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1291).\n\nThe primary changes here are:\n- `src/liblibc/lib.rs` was deleted\n- `src/liblibc` is now a submodule pointing at the external repository\n- `src/libstd/sys/unix/{c.rs,sync.rs}` were both deleted having all bindings folded into the external liblibc.\n- Many ad-hoc `extern` blocks in the standard library were removed in favor of bindings now being in the external liblibc.\n- Many functions/types were added to `src/libstd/sys/windows/c.rs`, and the scattered definitions throughout the standard library were consolidated here.\n\nAt the API level this commit is **not a breaking change**, although it is only very lightly tested on the *BSD variants and is probably going to break almost all of their builds! Follow-up commits to liblibc should in theory be all that's necessary to get the build working on the *BSDs again.\n",
