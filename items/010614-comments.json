    "body": "We discussed this at the triage meeting today, and came to the following conclusions:\n- Silent blocking in a destructor is a behavior that we want to avoid as much as possible\n- It's unclear whether exposing an api like this is vastly more efficient than just using message passing\n- If we have another method of blocking for something (like task.join()), why is it not selectable?\n- The task api today works well with its simplicity. We should perhaps make it easier to spawn for `proc() -> A` returning `Port<A>`, but that would be a separate bug tracking that.\n\nFor these reasons, we have decided to close this. We are still open to hearing reasons why we should move towards an API such as this, but we would want our concerns above to be addressed to see why this flavor of an API would be a better choice.\n",
