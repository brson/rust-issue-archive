Things like vectorcall can be used by C code quite easily (at least on Windows with msvc), and are likely to be part of the public interface of libraries. As such, Rust should be proactive in supporting these calling conventions when it knows they exist, rather than waiting for people to get fed up with maintaining custom builds of Rust.\n\nThere are weird custom calling conventions for things like Haskell and stuff which can't really be used from C code and are unlikely to be in the public interface of a library. I recommend not supporting these, as there's very little reason to support them.\n",

It seems reasonable to expose calling conventions which are supported by _all_ major C compilers if there is a demand. I don't know if that is the case here.\n",

We've had many cases in the past where patches exposed LLVM functionality just because it was neat and we could. LLVM is a big backend. It does lots of stuff. The more we expose the harder it is to maintain, spec, and port to non-LLVM backends.\n",

    "body": "I personally very much agree with @brson's [sentiments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30567#issuecomment-169206087) about not exposing everything LLVM does \"just because\", however I also agree with @Gankro's [assessment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30567#issuecomment-169419397) that this may not apply to this PR (e.g. it seems that vectorcall is both a prior name and has usage in other compilers).\n\nIn terms of of a public API exposed by the compiler itself, there's a few facets:\n- The name of this is basically instantly stabilized, so we would want to be very certain that this is the precise name we want for this calling convention. I'm a little worried about this and would be more comfortable having this be a nightly feature to start out personally.\n- All future backends to support _all of Rust_ would need to support this calling convention. I'm not too worried about this as this is unlikely to be widely used by 90% of Rust code and the other complexities of writing a new backend are likely to far outweigh this. (e.g. if an alternate backend doesn't support this to start out, that seems ok)\n- We may want to make sure that this is relatively well supported in LLVM itself. For example would it be possible to have assurances that LLVM won't generate errors if a vectorcall function has a specific set of arguments? For example if LLVM generates an error with two f32 arguments but not with two f64 arguments (for whatever reason) that would probably be something we'd want to argue against. (note that I personally have no idea what the vectorcall convention is, so this question/concern may just be moot)\n\n@ranma42 no we don't auto-generate tests for things like this, but I would personally like to see at least one usage of this in a test regardless.\n\nOverall I would like to explore putting this ABI behind a feature gate, and then I would be quite comfortable landing it.\n",

What I was worried about is that people call into some C library that is declared with this calling convention. Then we switch from LLVM to some other backend. And we find out that it's a pain to reproduce the precise behavior that LLVM had in this new backend, because it is linux specific and doesn't support this windows-specific calling convention.\n\nBasically, part of the argument for supporting a calling convention is that it is widespread on Win64, and hence whatever backend we choose will support it, which I think makes sense. But it's not true on linux, and hence by permitting it we are committing ourselves more to LLVM than we otherwise would. No?\n",

    "body": "@steffengy \n\n> This problem exists for every windows-specific calling convention though for example Win64 (which is the \"predecessor\" of vectorcall), which is currently supported, the same would apply.\n\nYes. I think we should consider generating an error (or at least a warning) for all such ABIs when they are used outside the target platform. I agree this is not specific to vectorcall (nor to Windows; I'm sure there are linux-specific conventions out there) and didn't mean to imply otherwise. But, as you say, I'm not too worried about this being a big problem in practice. I'll just let it go. :)\n",
