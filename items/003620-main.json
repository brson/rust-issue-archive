  "body": "Some types don't make sense to deserialize, such as `&str` types. This patch moves `deserialize` out of `Serializable` into it's own trait, and adds support for the following types:\n\n```\nchar\n&str\n@str\n&[T]\n@[T]\n```\n\nIt also adds an explicit `emit_struct` and `read_struct` that passes along the struct name to the Serializer/Deserializer.\n\nIt doesn't yet include the \"pass-the-serializer-in-a-a-trait-typarm\" that @nikomatsakis and I were talking about in IRC, as that seems to trip over an ICE.\n\nIt also includes a small patch that renames `vec::raw::from_slice` into `vec::raw::buf_as_slice`, which matches `str::raw::buf_as_slice` and a small bit of cleanup.\n",
