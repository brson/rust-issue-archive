If we're not going to mark this as a 1.0 bug, I think we'd be better off just to close. (I personally am not inclined to change the syntax, which seems consistent with other declarations)\n",

    "body": "Rust's grammar is not regular, so it will never be greppable in the general case. You're going to be finding things inside comments, strings, type bounds etc. The rustdoc issue seems to me a problem that can be solved stylistically and/or with better code highlighting.\n\nFor example, you could alter the coding style to place the impl on a separate line from the rest of the declaration:\n\n``` rust\nimpl<A: ToStr + Hash + Eq, B: ToStr>\nToStr for HashMap<A, B>\n```\n\nOr you could emphasize the <>'s to visually subdivide the declaration (can't convey this using Markdown), or emphasize the type and trait. I think there is a lot of room for improvement from a visual presentation side of things. I don't think the difficulty in reading the current CSS/HTML should be a guiding principle behind syntax changes.\n",
