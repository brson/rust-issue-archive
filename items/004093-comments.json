Of course, mutable fields are probably going away, making that not work.\n\nIf moves based on type also applied to mutable types _and_ you could mutate captures, then your original example could work as written.\n",

After discussing with @pcwalton I think we formulated a plan as follows: you can capture a mut variable, but it moves the value in and also prevents it from being later reassigned.  That means that once you capture the mut variable it will only be accessible (and mutable) from within the closure.  This should be a small tweak to liveness.\n",
