Also, this isn't really Mut - you can still fulfill an AdtDef<'tcx> with a Ty<'static>.\n\nWhile technically true, that's not particularly interesting, is it? The intention of these types is as I wrote them, no?

I am happy with it, this is nice work.\n\nr+ modulo:\n- [ ] rename `AdtDef_` to `AdtDefData` or `AdtDefStruct` or something similar with a word, not an underscore\n- [ ] readable type aliases for the (mostly) \"read-only\" `&'tcx AdtDefData<'tcx,'static>` and the mutable `&'tcx AdtDefData<'tcx,'tcx>`. Personally, I think it's worth giving both of them an alias because it makes the pattern clearer, even if the latter gets little use.\n- [ ] remove or at minimum document calls to `skip_binder`\n- [ ] explain where the `T: Copy` bound comes from (lets us use Cell; since we store `&T` it's fine; could be lifted in the future but would require more unsafe code). I was thinking that it mattered for concurrency but of course I was being silly: the whole POINT of an ivar is that it's write-once, and hence you can  clone the contents without fear of them being overwritten, after all.\n",
