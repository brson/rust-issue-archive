    "body": "> I believe this is a duplicate of #12919.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nHowever, I can't reproduce this anymore with 0.12 or with:\n\n```\nrustc 0.13.0-dev (7dbd4349c 2014-10-13 10:32:43 +0000)\n```\n\nI think it's no longer ICEing because the current `Slice` in the prelude is `std::ops::Slice`, whereas at the moment of the bug report the `Slice` in the prelude was `core::slice::Slice`. I wonder if the ICE trigger was the number of generic parameters that the trait accepts? (two for `ops::Slice` vs one for `slice::Slice`)\n\nAnyhow, I'm closing this issue since it no longer contains a valid STR.\n",
