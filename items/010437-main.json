  "body": "In #10422, I didn't actually test to make sure that the '-Z gen-crate-map'\noption was usable before I implemented it. The crate map was indeed generated\nwhen '-Z gen-crate-map' was specified, but the I/O factory slot was empty\nbecause of an extra check in trans about filling in that location.\n\nThis commit both fixes that location, and checks in a \"fancy test\" which does\nlots of fun stuff. The test will use the rustc library to compile a rust crate,\nand then compile a C program to link against that crate and run the C program.\nTo my knowledge this is the first test of its kind, so it's a little ad-hoc, but\nit seems to get the job done. We could perhaps generalize running tests like\nthis, but for now I think it's fine to have this sort of functionality tucked\naway in a test.\n",
