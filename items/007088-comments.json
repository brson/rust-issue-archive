    "body": "visting for triage, email from 2013-08-26.\n\nSo, I assume that `#[deriving(Eq)] struct Foo<T> { ... }` (for example) would, in this new world, cause the implicit introduction of an impl like:\n\n```\nimpl<T:Eq<T>> Eq<Foo<T>> for Foo<T> {\n  fn eq(&self, other: &Foo<T>) { ... <same as now> ... }\n}\n```\n\nIs that right?\n\nI'm not sure about the type inference implications.  (@nikomatsakis, any comments?)\n\n(I'm also not sure that the motivation of removing the `_equiv` methods from HashMap is a good one; but maybe one can always re-encode any previously behavior by wrapping one's keys in structs with their own non-derived implementation of Eq, so this objection may not be well motivated.  Not sure yet.)\n",
