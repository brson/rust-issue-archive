    "body": "This does seem to play nicely into the `Set` and `MutableSet` traits in that `insert` and `remove` operating on one element would be convenient. It may provide surprising results like @Gankro pointed out, but I think that the symmetry would be more valuable.\n\nFor now, though, I'm not sure if adding new collections traits is the best option. The current traits are sort of ad-hoc and seem to be lacking an overall design in terms of interactions with one another and extensions into the future. Perhaps these methods could be inherent methods for now pending a redesign in the future? I don't think anyone is taking a generic `Set` or `MutableSet` today, so I don't think too much functionality will be lost.\n",

    "body": "This should be ready for further review. TreeMultiset now implements all the traits that TreeSet implements and provides all the same methods as well, with the exception of `move_iter` (see below). I've also implemented the `sum` method for performing multiset sums.\n\nFor `move_iter`, we have a bit of an issue since the current design does not store multiple copies but simply a counter. In order to properly implement this I need to either change it to store multiple copies or only implement for cloneable values.\n\nI should also point out that it's unclear to me how this could support both `insert_many` and a generic `move_iter` at the same time. If you're just giving a number for the number of occurrences an item should have, multiple values aren't available to be moved out by `move_iter`. So you either have to give up `insert_many` or make `move_iter` work only for Cloneable items.\n",

Although... the more I think about it the more I'm uncertain if my TreeMultiSet impl makes sense (can you get the ref out of the Vec correctly?). A duplicate key tree would be saner there, for sure.\n\nDuplicate keys also has distinct semantics wrt popping nodes. If your keys have destructors, then `TreeMap<K, Vec<V>>` is _very_ different from `DuplicateTreeMap<K,V>`. It would have to be a `TreeMap<&K, Vec<(K,V)>>` to have the same external-facing effects. Although if you assume keys are all worthless rubbish, then `TreeMap<K, Vec<V>>` will have serious space savings by only storing one key.\n\nNot sure which is the desired behaviour!\n",
