The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @huonw (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton On the performance: I've built a simple Hello, world program with both nightly and stage2. Performance figures are roughly same, but curiously (or obviously?) the new rustc is both faster (best time being 0.56s vs. 0.62s) and consumes less memory (best max resident being 45.3M vs. 57.9M). I guess it is an impact of decoder changes plus metadata reduction, but would never be sure.\n\nI've also run `make dist`. The resulting tarball is 88MB while the current nightly is 97MB. Considering that the encoder/decoder changes do not reduce inherent information entropy, this is actually a huge win (or gzip is that much gullible). For fun I've also `zcat | xzcat -z`-ed the tarball; the result is, not surprisingly, 68MB. Maybe we should ship `.tar.xz` alongside of existing `.tar.gz` archives :wink:\n",
