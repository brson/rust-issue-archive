    "body": "Sorry for not responding earlier, was ill last week.\n\nSome thoughts:\n1. It's not auto-serialization in principle that causes the bloat but its unfortunate interaction with the verbose RBML format. We don't have to stick with RBML in the future.\n2. The `Ty` and `Substs` values in the MIR use the `tyencode/tydecode` infrastructure so they won't contribute to data bloat even now. The rest of the MIR data structures will though.\n3. While discussing this with @nikomatsakis before starting the implementation, we came to the conclusion that it would be great for maintainability and refactorability if we could get rid of as much serialization boilerplate code as possible. I think that making the autoserialization support in the compiler more powerful so it can support space-efficient encodings and deal with context-dependent (de-)serialization is the way to go (although I'm not convinced that the TLS-based implementation of the latter is the best solution in the long term).\n",

Writing serialization code is painful --- not so much a source of _bugs_ (though I've had a few from tyencode), but really _annoying_, and to little purpose. I don't think autogenerated serialization needs to be inefficienct. Any inefficiences we see can easily be overcome by implementing serialization by hand for a particular type -- you can then use the autogenerated code as a building block, by writing things like\n\n``` rust\n// serialize:\nserialize((&self.foo, &self.bar)); // serialize first 2 fields, but not self.span\n\n// deserialize:\nlet (foo, bar) = deserialize();\nMyType { foo: foo, bar: bar, span: DUMMY_SP }\n```\n",
