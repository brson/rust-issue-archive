    "body": "We may also want to consider being able to derive `Into` for the numeric types as well, although that's not as interesting because the enum variants can be converted into integral types with `as` (but it's still potentially useful).\n\nNote that we can't derive `From<T> for i32`, which would be preferred, as that requires `T` to be public and I'm not aware of any precedent for `#[derive]` only working on public types. But that restriction doesn't apply to `Into`, so we can derive e.g. `Into<i32>` just fine.\n",
