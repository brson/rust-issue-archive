    "body": "I'd be hesitant to include this. We have some different lints than with something like gcc's `-Wall` which I don't think actually turns on _all_ the warnings. The major use case here I think would be `-A all`, whereas `-D all` and `-W all` would almost never be used.\n\nI think that [globally resetting all warnings](https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/commit/b9f33d8f4a017be49c1496632d40e5369520c7f6) would accomplish this same purpose, along with not introducing behavior which is almost never used.\n\nAdditionally here, as a lint attribute one would expect `#[allow(all)]` to work, but it doesn't work as implemented.\n",
