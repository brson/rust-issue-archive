    "body": "I have toyed with the idea of moving `std::io` into core or another library underneath the standard library in the past, but I've always ended up having to bend over too far to get everything to work out. \n\nOne of the major problems I am unsure of how to deal with is `IoError`. We could take a generic approach that @huonw laid out, but that would require language changes I don't believe are in place.\n\nIn general, I've been wary about having a `core::io` module because I/O isn't necessarily incredibly core to the rust language itself, but it would certainly be useful to replace traits such as `FormatWriter` and `hash::Writer`!\n",

    "body": "My personal opinion is that having the reader/writer traits parameterized by an error is a non-starter. Using the encodable/decodable traits are quite painful to have to have an extra type parameter all over the place, and the reader/writer traits are even more common. To make a change such as that I would rather wait for something like associated items or the typedef that @huonw mentioned.\n",
