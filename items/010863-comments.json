Do you know why the test is not working?  I'm confused because if I change [line 71](https://github.com/cadencemarseille/rust-pcre/blob/b52df3e/src/pcre/pkg.rs#L71) of rust-pcre's package script and mistype \"rust-pcre\", then the io_error condition is raised and the IoErrorKind is FileNotFound (using `rustc` with this patch).\n\nEvery time I run `make check-stage1-std NO_REBUILD=1 NO_BENCH=1 VERBOSE=1` it eventually fails with:\n\n<pre>\nfailures:\n    run::tests::test_process_output_io_error_file_not_found\ntest result: FAILED. 1316 passed; 1 failed; 92 ignored; 0 measured\ntask '<main>' failed at 'Some tests failed', /Users/cadencemarseille/Projects/rust/src/libextra/test.rs:168\n</pre>\n",
