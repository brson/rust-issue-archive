    "body": "@Aatch I agree, but I don't know of a way to wrap URLs in Markdown, and the lines have to be <= 80 chars. I can do this if I don't set the URL out separately, but generally this is less readable when printed out on the command line. For example, it would look like this:\n\n```\nThe only function calls allowed in static or constant expressions are\nconstructors for enum variants and structs, or `const fn`s. Rust currently does\nnot support more general compile-time function execution.\n\nSee [RFC 911](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0911-const-fn\n.md) for more details on the design of `const fn`s.\n```\n\nEdit: Now that I think about it, I'm not sure that this works either. Github renders the URL here as `https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0911-const-fn%0A.md`\n",
