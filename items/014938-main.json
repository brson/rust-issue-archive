  "body": "I'm not too confident about my approach regarding the handling of the docs, so here goes my train of thought:\n\nThe first commit does the reexport. But the side effect is that two `num_cpus` entries appear in the docs: `std::os::num_cpus` and `std::rt::num_cpus`, but we only need the former one.\n\nThe second commit deals with the duplicated entry. Is my first time using `rustdoc`, but I expected that a `#[doc(hidden)]` attribute on the `pub use self::util::num_cpus` would remove the duplicated entry - this didn't work and _this seems like a bug to me_ (or it could be my inexperience with `rustdoc`). The only way I found to remove the duplicated entry was to make the `util` module public (this may not be acceptable), in addition to the `#[doc(hidden)]` attribute.\n\nThe third commit makes sure that other docs are kept intact (i.e. that the `std::rt::util` module doesn't appear in the docs).\n\ncc @brson who requested the reexport, and @alexcrichton, who has been working on rustdoc lately.\n",
