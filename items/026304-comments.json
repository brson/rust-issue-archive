I feel like this isn't quite the route we want to take, however, as there is a **huge** amount of duplication between the HTML generation and the ascii generation. If we want to go this route I think we'll want some layer of abstraction to have the same core layer generating documentation and then the backend can be HTML or ascii.\n\nThat being said, could you elaborate on the rationale for this change? I'm not sure what the use case is here and I was unaware that we wanted to add additional backends to rustdoc at this time.\n",

But why not also highlighting source code displayed by the compiler when it hits an error. I think that might be a very big improvement (I really like highlighting).\n\nThis PR is very incomplete for the moment. I wanna provide a common trait for both Html and Ascii to avoid code duplication when possible. I also need to make highlighting consistent and homogenous (and use libterm for it).\n",
