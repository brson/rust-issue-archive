    "body": "I belive ctypes is the only lint with this problem? I went through the list, and the others seem fine. The only other one which is borderline is `type-limits`, which when allowed will squelch warnings for useless comparions , so perhaps it can be renamed `unnecessary-comparison`.\n\nSo I don't think this is a wider problem, unless you're refering to something else. I do think this is worth fixing, though. `ctypes` is a bad name in general. I'm not sure `ffi_rust_types` is much better, I think I prefer `unspecified_repr_in_ffi`. It's long, and it should be long, because you're doing _really bad things_ with it. I will revive my patch for struct representation stuff today.\n\nFor a transition plan, that's a good point. We could keep in support for ctypes but rather than doing the normal linty thing, check if it is used and emit a deprecation warning saying to use the new name.\n",

    "body": "As far as deprecation goes and involving more lints goes, we could keep a map of aliases for different names for each lint (with a 'preferred' name) and if the preferred name is not the one used we could print the deprecation warning. Support for the aliases could be dropped in a later version once appropriate. My only question of this is where this alias map would live. Thoughts on that?\n\n@brson  which other lints have this problem?\n\nIf we use the map as I suggested we could easily add support for other lints which have this problem which for which an alias would be nice so that a user typing #{allow[ctypes]} wouldn't be shocked that they were given an error due to a non-existent lint\n\nI also agree with @cmr in that another, more explicit name would probably be better. I'm not sure, however, that the name should necessarily be longer, as I don't think doing bad things should necessarily be a pain to do. If anything, I would argue it be shorter so the user is less focused on things like getting the spelling correct and more focused on making sure they're writing safe code.\n",
