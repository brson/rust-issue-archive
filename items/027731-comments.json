    "body": "@BurntSushi, @nikomatsakis, and I talked about this recently at the work week, and our thoughts are:\n- The original strategy of stabilizing the small pieces (intrinsics + #[repr(simd)]) in the compiler is probably the best way forward here. More experimentation can happen in the `simd` crate, but those are at least the bare bones for moving forward.\n- Specifically with intrinsics, we probably want to stabilize defining them in a different fashion, specifically:\n  \n  ``` rust\n  #[simd_intrinsic = \"name\"] \n  pub fn foo(a: A, b: B) -> C {\n      foo(a, b)\n  }\n  ```\n  \n  That is, we'd probably stabilize a new `#[simd_intrinsic]` (ish) attribute whose name would closely follow the standard naming conventions (e.g. those in C compilers). The function would look like normal Rust and look like it recurses into itself but the compiler would understand that _direct calls to the function_ are actually implemented inline, so this isn't actually infinite recursion.\n- The \"structural typing\" of the intrinsics is relatively ok. That is, the compiler can verify any definition is correct, even though each definition may be slightly different (e.g. any 32-bit x 4 value could show up perhaps). The bad part, however, is that not all intrinsics can be verified. For example the [`simd_lt`](https://github.com/huonw/simd/blob/0d85d25d5cc3788062b252e31ad48dd19e805e90/src/lib.rs#L197) intrinsic can have any number of SIMD types instantiated, but a pairing like `String` and `Vec<u8>` would be nonsensical. This may be difficult to solve in a \"pure\" fashion but may be worth stomaching to stabilize the SIMD intrinsics (which in general should never be called in favor of the `simd` crate itself)\n- Specifically with `#[repr(simd)]`, we may want to remove support for tagging a generic structure. This does not appear to be used in the `simd` crate today and may not be necessary at all, in which case it's probably just complications that we don't want to have to think about today.\n- One possible route with the intrinsics would be a thought by @arielb1 where any illegal instantiation of type parameters just causes the intrinsic to codegen as a trap, which means that any instantiation is possible and some would just fail at runtime (which would need to be avoided anyway).\n\nAll of this was discussed hopefully with an eye to start the process of stabilization soon-ish, and then we can all get SIMD on stable Rust!\n\ncc @eddyb, you likely have many opinions as well!\n",

Although, would it be restricted to things that are _definitely_ about SIMD?\nThere are various platform intrinsics that don't do anything with vectors, such as `prefetch`.\n\nOther than that, this seems like a good move forward, without the complexities I was worried about.\n",

    "body": "So I had a really interesting conversation with @sunfishcode on the topic of SIMD, and in particular the design of SIMD in [WASM](https://github.com/WebAssembly). The high-level summary was two points:\n1. The current breakdown (platform-specific intrinsics, a portable layer atop) is a good one.\n2. Since we modeled the SIMD crate on the JS SIMD designs, which are now being incorporated into WASM, it will align well with the WASM design. Code that can be expressed in terms of the simd crate will thus also be a good candidate for compiling to WASM. \n\nSome other interesting points that he raised:\n1. SIMD has many audiences with diverse needs, and you can't necessarily accommodate them all very well with just one API:\n- codec authors want the raw intrinsics because they use them in clever and unexpected ways;\n- HPC people want higher-level abstractions but don't need access to every trick in the book;\n- high-performance demands also require raw intrinsics, because they don't mind investing the time to reshape the algorithm for each platform.\n1. One way to support these diverse needs, which has been considered for WASM, is to offer the \"union\" of features across platforms, but offer a way to query which features are \"fast\" (the idea is that the \"slow\" features will be emulated). In Rust I would expect we may want similar things, though perhaps the \"slow\" paths would just trap? (It's probably a bug if you actually wind up executing one of them.)\n",

    "body": "On the topic of intrinsics, I feel overall pretty good about some kind of attribute that can be applied to a `fn` to indicate that the compiler should compile it via pure instructions. Such functions would have to have appropriate argument/return types (roughly like today). If the argument/return types are not generic, this seems very harmless to me, as we can check it purely at the definition site (as @alexcrichton noted).\n\nHowever, I feel mildly less good about the generic versions, since these cannot be checked until trans time, which means we have to face two annoying choices:\n- issue traps or compilation errors when an intrinsic is used incorrectly;\n- introduce more machinery into the compiler like special SIMD traits.\n\nHowever, it does seem that there is a third way out: we could remove all support for generic intrinsics, and instead have people define their own traits that map to these operations. For example, today the `simd` crate does something roughly like this:\n\n``` rust\n#[simd_intrinsic(...)]\nfn simd_eq<T,U>(t: T, u: T) -> U;\n\nunsafe trait Simd {\n    type EqType;\n}\n\nfn generic_eq<T:Simd>(t: T, u: T) -> T::EqType {\n    simd_eq(t, t)\n}\n\nunsafe impl Simd for u32x4 { ... } // etc\n```\n\nIt seems like we could instead do:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Simd { // no longer an unsafe trait\n    type EqType;\n\n    // we now include a method for the various simd operations we might want to do:\n    fn eq(x: &Self, y: &Self) -> Self::EqType;\n    ...\n}\n\n#[simd_intrinsic]\nfn eq_u32x4(x: u32x4, y: u32x4) -> boolx4 {...}\n\nimpl Simd for u32x4 {\n    #[inline(always)]\n    fn eq(x: &Self, y: &Self) -> Self::EqType {\n         eq_u32x4(x, y)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI'm probably getting some of the details wrong (have to consult the crate for the precise names involved) but hopefully you get the idea. Basically, the compiler only supports monotype intrinsics, and the wrapper crate adds (using normal trait methods) any generic dispatch needed.\n",

    "body": "> The function would look like normal Rust and look like it recurses into itself but the compiler would understand that direct calls to the function are actually implemented inline, so this isn't actually infinite recursion.\n\nIs there a good reason for making the function recurse into itself? It seems like unnecessary repetition to me. Would a macro like `intrinsic!()`, similar to `unreachable!()`, be possible?\n\n> - codec authors want the raw intrinsics because they use them in clever and unexpected ways;\n> - HPC people want higher-level abstractions but don't need access to every trick in the book;\n> - high-performance demands also require raw intrinsics, because they don't mind investing the time to reshape the algorithm for each platform.\n\nI agree. This is one of the papercuts of the current state: most of the platform-specific intrinsics are there with their usual names, except for a few basic arithmetic operations, which are `simd_add` and such. I think it would be better to expose all of the raw platform intrinsics and build a higher-level cross-platform `simd_add` on top of that with `#[cfg(target_feature)]`. A crate like `simd` could build on top of that by providing fallback (e.g. two SSE adds if AVX is not available). It wouldn\u2019t be generic, but does it need to be? I can\u2019t think of a `#[repr(simd)]` type that is not just an n-tuple of the scalar type. And for the low-level intrinsics the types have little meaning anyway (e.g. `_mm256_cmp_ps` returns a vector of floats, but actually they are bitmasks).\n",

If the compiler provides intrinsics for all possible vector types for this case, then it should be fine.\n\nOne other possibility that comes to mind now that we're close to it is to finish type-level integers, then make generic intrinsics with declarations like this:\n\n```\nfn simd_mul<T>(v1: T, v2: T) -> T\nwhere std::mem::size_of<T>(): platform_simd_size, std::mem::align_of<T>(): platform_simd_align {\n//magic code\n}\n```\n\nThis of course depends on how close we are to having type-level integers, but it should be checkable well before trans in any sane implementation of type-level integers I can think of.  Just a thought.\n",

I still basically stand by my previous comment, though I think @eddyb suggested (perhaps on IRC) the idea of applying the special attribute directly to the method in the impl, and that seems even better (perhaps just making it a lang item -- it would mean though that this lang item can be applied multiple times).\n\nI have no objection to exposing the platform intrinsics explicitly, but it also doesn't seem like a _required_ ingredient. It'd be great to make progress on the wrapper library, and adding in platform-specific names feels orthogonal to me. (Right? This is a bit out of cache.)\n",

As parts of the above get proposed for stabilization they will get their own tracking issues.

I'm not sure why `core::asm::nop` is necessary, nor what semantics it would have in the abstract machine (e.g. `fn nop() {}` ?), and for `memory_barrier`, you probably want to argue why `compiler_barrier`, `atomic::fence`, etc. aren't enough. Also for Cortex-M there are some of these operations in `core::arm` available already, but none of them are in the path towards stabilization due to other design issues with the API of the ACLE intrinsics.",

    "body": "@thejpster Apologies for taking so long to get back to you.\r\n\r\n## Short Version\r\nI don't think I need `core::asm::nop`, as I was using it in place of a barrier. `core::asm::volatile_nop` may be valuable. `core::sync::atomic::compiler_fence` is currently broken on msp430, but will _probably_ work fine as a barrier once it works.\r\n\r\n## Long Version\r\nLooks like I made [offhand comments](https://freenode.logbot.info/rust-embedded/20200107#c3045947-c3045964) about how putting `nop` and `barrier` into `core::asm` would remove all the remaining assembly in msp430 crates. This is one of the last standing issues left for me to attempt getting msp430 into stable.\r\n\r\nI did some testing tonight; I've been only using `nop` for the purposes of barriers it seems. I think your use case of a `volatile_nop` to force a peripheral delay may be valid for msp430 as well, but I don't have any examples offhand. _It appears that [`barrier`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/msp430/blob/master/src/asm.rs#L16-L21) can be used in any place where I was using a generic [`nop`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/msp430/blob/master/src/asm.rs#L4-L13)._ They _are_ in fact nearly the same code :).\r\n\r\nAs @Amanieu mentions:\r\n>The barrier seems to just be a compiler fence. You should be able to do it on stable with compiler_fence(SeqCst).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the LLVM backend for MSP430 can't handle [`compiler_fence`]( for some reason, while it _can_ handle the [`barrier`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/msp430/blob/master/src/asm.rs#L16-L21) we defined in the `msp430` crate. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#![no_main]\r\n#![no_std]\r\n\r\nextern crate panic_msp430; // For now, we only have an infinitely-looping panic handler.\r\n\r\nuse core::sync::atomic::{compiler_fence, Ordering};\r\nuse msp430_rt::entry;\r\n\r\n#[allow(unused)]\r\n// Bring interrupt vectors into scope so the linker can see them; enabling the \"rt\"\r\n// feature of msp430g2553 transitively enables the \"device\" feature of msp430-rt.\r\n// This prevents default interrupt vectors from being generated.\r\nuse msp430g2211;\r\n\r\n#[entry]\r\nfn main() -> ! {\r\n    compiler_fence(Ordering::SeqCst);\r\n\r\n    loop {\r\n        // Application begins here.\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will die with a semi-recent nightly Rust:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWilliam@DESKTOP-H0PMN4M MINGW64 ~/Projects/MSP430/msp430g2211-quickstart\r\n$ xargo build --target=msp430-none-elf --release\r\n   Compiling msp430g2211-quickstart v0.1.0 (C:\\msys64\\home\\William\\Projects\\MSP430\\msp430g2211-quickstart)\r\nLLVM ERROR: Cannot select: 0x5052560: ch = AtomicFence 0x29a76d8, Constant:i16<7>, Constant:i16<0>\r\n  0x5052490: i16 = Constant<7>\r\n  0x50524f8: i16 = Constant<0>\r\nIn function: main\r\nerror: could not compile `msp430g2211-quickstart`.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\r\n\r\nWilliam@DESKTOP-H0PMN4M MINGW64 ~/Projects/MSP430/msp430g2211-quickstart\r\n$ rustc -V\r\nrustc 1.42.0-nightly (760ce94c6 2020-01-04)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't normally handle the LLVM side of things, but I may have to this time.

I didn't thoroughly vet this list so ymmv. Also some intrinsics were changed from `unstable(feature = \"stdsimd\")` to `stable(feature = \"something\")` which this list does not include. This also does not include any feature declarations that were split onto multiple lines, if any exist (I didn't check).",
