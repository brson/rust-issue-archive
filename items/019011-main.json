  "body": "It looks like currently kinds required by traits are not propagated when they are wrapped in a TyTrait. Additionally, in SelectionContext::builtin_bound, no attempt is made to check whether the target trait or its supertraits require the kind specified.\n\nThis PR alters SelectionContext::builtin_bound to examine all supertraits in the target trait's bounds recursively for required kinds.\n\nAlternatively, the kinds could be added to the TyTrait upon creation (by just setting its builtin_bounds to the union of the bounds requested in this instance and the bounds required by the trait), this option may have less overhead during compilation but information is lost about which kinds were explicitly requested for this instance (vs those specified by traits/supertraits) would be lost.\n",
