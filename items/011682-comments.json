I'm worried that having both `~[T]` and a `Vec<T>` type with a capacity will be too complex as both _can_ be grown. It's obviously essential for traits but I still prefer just using plain library types for vectors and the built-in fixed-size arrays and slices.\n",

    "body": "I also have concerns about `Vec<T>` and `~[T]`, because it seems to me like you wouldn't actually end up using `~[T]` that often. It does kinda make sense that `~[T]` is a type in the typesystem, but it seems that `&[T]` would be the primary use case for sigil + `[T]`.\n\nRegardless, everything I understand about DST means that `~[T]` is _not_ a growable vector, and we'll of course always need one of those. It also sounds like we'll want DST, so it sounds like it's inevitable that we're going to have a `Vec` implementation which looks like this.\n\nAre there any objections to merging this now?\n",
