    "body": "My first thought was no, because swapping contexts needs direct access to the machine's registers. However, we already have set_registers and get_registers written in assembly, so we could probably write the swap function in LLVM.\n\nIf we do this, can we guarantee that LLVM won't turn the call to set_registers into a tail call like is happening in the C version?\n",
