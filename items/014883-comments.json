    "body": "I think `Show` impl is useful for `RefCell` because more often than not, `RefCell` is going to be used in complex data structures rather than alone.  And in order to show everything it's going to need a `Show` impl.  \n\nAlso this impl doesn't fail, the test makes sure it doesn't.  If you mean it might print out something different depending on the state of `RefCell` then yes it will do that, but it makes sense given what `RefCell` is all about.\n\nWhat it displays when the refcell is already borrowed can easily be changed.  I was thinking either show nothing or some kind of message saying it's already borrowed, and the latter is less confusing so I went with that\n",
