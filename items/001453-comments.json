By monitoring all the language-induced breakage going on in cargo we can start developing better tools to migrate versions.\n\nWhen it fails to build a package, we could run it through a special compiler who's job is to upgrade the code. We will need a way to measure 'upgradedness' - it's possible we can do a lot of useful analysis and transformations without completely succeeding. Part of the process of developing the Rust language will be trying to improve the score of the upgrade compiler.\n\nI'm putting this on 0.5 in the hopes that I can make _some_ progress.\n",
