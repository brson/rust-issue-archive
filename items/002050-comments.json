Iterating over an owned data structure requires it to be frozen first, and it only ever makes sense to modify a value (not a key) since touching a key would ruin the data structure invariants. Both `treemap` and `hashmap` are owned maps and `oldmap` is deprecated, and all future mutable data structures should be owned.\n\n A method for iterating over the container and modifying the values in-place would definitely be a good idea.\n",
