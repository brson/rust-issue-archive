    "body": "I thought more about this.  Now I think I was wrong.  There are two things that should happen (one of which I think already does):\n1. Exhaustiveness checking should always consider `*T` to be inhabited, because it might be NULL\n2. `alt foo {}`, presuming it passes exhaustiveness checking, should translate to a simple `fail`.  \n\nBasically, `alt` is defined to match an arm and execute its code.  If no arm matches, alt is defined to fail.  Exhaustiveness checking guarantees that fail cannot happen---barring unsafe code.  And, barring unsafe code, it is impossible to produce an instance of an empty enum, therefore, we can generate the fail safe in the knowledge it will never execute.\n\nThe only realistic scenario where this might matter I can come up with is auto-generated code, where it might happen that in some situations an empty enum is produced, probably corresponding to some case in the generated code that can never happen (a protocol state which can never be entered or what have you).  In that case, generating a fail is the right to do: it's essentially an assertion failure, \"The impossible happened!\"\n",
