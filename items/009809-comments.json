While you're at it, there's also a few other things which I think could get reorganized.\n- Could you move the `extern static CRATE_MAP` business to just inside the non-windows `get_crate_map`?\n- I think you can remove the `iter_module_map` function b/c it's so simple and natural now\n\nOtherwise, looks good to me, thanks!\n",
