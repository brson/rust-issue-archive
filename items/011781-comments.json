    "body": "I think we want Freeze to stay. it's not clear to me that Send and Freeze have any inherent relationship. I think the breakdown is:\n- Send (deeply owned)\n- Freeze (deeply immutable if aliased)\n- Share (mutable, but threadsafe even if aliased)\n\nI don't know that any of those three traits have any particular relationship to one another:\n- `Freeze` does not seem to imply `Share`: consider `GC<T>` -- it is `Freeze`, I think, but it is not threadsafe to access from another thread.\n- `Send` does not seem to imply `Freeze`: consider `Cell<T>`, which owns its contents.\n- `Send` does not seem to imply `Share`: consider again `Cell<T>`.\n\nFor many cases, then, multiple bound are probably required:\n- Sending data requires `Send`\n- ARC wants `Send+Share`\n- ...\n\nOK, gotta go, maybe more writeup / thought is needed here than I previously thought!\n\n_Note:_ In the past I've considered a fourth builtin bound `Fork`, which was supposed to be something like \"mutable but threadsafe is not aliased\". But I'm not sure that this bound is still needed. The primary motivation was to describe the set of closures that can safely be executed as [data-parallel jobs](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/data-parallelism-in-rust/). But I think it's better to address this via a combination of the above bounds and #8622 (closure, trait unification). That is, if we had two trait types like `trait Fn { fn call(&self, ...) }` and `trait FnMut { fn call(&mut self, ...) }`, then a \"parallel fork\" API would take `&mut FnMut:Share` and the \"parallel map\" API would take `&Fn:Share`, and I believe that all requirements are met.\n",

    "body": "I've been thinking about this more. Based on some recent IRC conversations, I believe the correct meaning of `Freeze` may be:\n\n> A type `T` is `Freeze` if, given a variable `x` of type `&'a T`, all data reachable from `x` via `x` is immutable for the lifetime `'a`.\n\nThe reason for including the clause \"via `x`\" is to allow `proc` to be freeze. I think a `proc` is freeze because you can't call it or interact with it from an aliased context; so even if it closers over mutable data, who cares?\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the simpler definitions (without the `via` clause) suffice:\n- Send: Given `x: T`, `x` can be safely transferred to another task without leaving any aliases.\n- Freeze: Given `x: &T`, all data reachable from `x` is immutable\n- Share: Given `x: &T`, all data reachable from `x` is threadsafe\n\nHere threadsafe is defined as \"accessible from multiple threads without data races\". Also, when I say \"all data reachable from `x`\", that's not quite the right phrase. I really mean something like \"all operations possible on data reachable from `x`\". Hence `Atomic<T>` is threadsafe.\n",

    "body": "Actually, it is if it would be valuable to include `proc`. It's a stretch -- the main idea is \"a proc is inert in such a setting, so why not?\" Original motivation was so that static immutable values (which must be Freeze) could include enums which have a variant that might have a proc, even if the particular variant used in the static does not. But we realized that applying the rules on static immutable values consistently (i.e., applying the rules to the _value_ not the _type_) means that such an example is permitted anyhow. So i'm inclined to go with the simpler definition. Of course, given my \"all operations possible on data reachable from `x`\" sort of implies \"via `x`\" anyway, so maybe either way `proc` is included.\n",

    "body": "I've been thinking this over. \n\nMy current opinion is that `Freeze` and `Share` ought to mean:\n- `Freeze` implies that the _interior_ is immutable if aliased.\n- `Share` implies that all reachable content is _threadsafe_.\n\nThe _interior_ is defined as all content reachable without traversing a pointer. \n\n_Threadsafe_ is defined as \"exposing no operation that permits a data race if multiple threads have access to a `&T` pointer simultaneously\".  (NB: the type system should guarantee that if you have access to memory via a `&T` pointer, the only other way to gain access to that memory is through another `&T` pointer, though this is blocked on #12624.) **UPDATE:** To be clear, this property does hold today, it's just that maintaining this property _and_ having the APIs I want is blocked on #12624.\n\nIn both cases, when we say \"immutable\" or \"threadsafe\", we are concerned with the public API that a type exports. In other words, implementing Freeze or Share (presuming opt-in) is a contract between the module that defines the module and its non-descendants.\n\nTherefore, `Rc<T>` is `Freeze` (regardless of `T`). `Gc<T>` is probably the only pointer type that is not Freeze, since we want to reserve the right to have a moving GC.\n\nWithout using unsafe code, all types are `Share`. When using unsafe code to enable interior mutability, the only way a type can be `Share` is if either atomics or other suitable barriers are used to establish the happens- before relation and thus prevent a data race.\n\nMotivation for these definitions:\n1. Freeze is intended for use in optimization. It allows us to improve the performance of alias analysis because two `&T` pointers can be considered non-interfering. It is also used to prevent segfaults related to immutable data being placed in `static` values. For these purposes, interior guarantees are sufficient.\n2. Share is intended to prevent data races. For these purposes, reachability is the important metric, because we are concerned about all possible operations the user might do with access to that type.\n\n## Possible variations\n\nWhile writing this, I was wondering if perhaps this definition isn't quite right, particularly concerning Freeze. This is current definition is sufficient to help LLVM optimization, but a stronger definition -- such as ownership or reachability? -- might enable the _Rust front-end_ to perform more aggressive optimization. I am not sure, though. I was contemplating things like reordering function calls or pulling them out of loops, but given thread-local data, side-effects, and so on it's unclear if this would ever be safe unless we've analyzed the body of those calls. And if we've done that, then the Freeze type is probably not particularly helpful. So I'm still leaning towards this being the right set of definitions.\n",

    "body": "Some further clarifications and notes:\n- One impact of those definitions I gave is that `Rc<Cell<int>>` is freeze. Perhaps this seems surprising, but the point is that the mutable data is not interior to the type but accessible only via pointer.  (Also, as a side note, I can't see any definition of `Freeze` that permits `Rc<int>` to be Freeze but not `Rc<Cell<int>>`, since the ref count is always mutable via user operations.)\n- I'd prefer not to have rules that hinge on _ownership_ but rather to stick to _reachability_ or _interior_. The reason for that is that as we move to a smart pointer world, ownership becomes...trickier to define and validate. Though to some extent these rules are for humans to consume. But still, where possible I'd like to stick to things that are clearly defined in terms of machine mechanics.\n",

We may want to do this later, though.\n\n> Without using unsafe code, all types are `Share`\n\nThis sounds right to me!\n\n> Therefore, `Rc<T>` is `Freeze`\n\nThis means (as we said earlier on IRC) that `Rc<Cell<int>>` would be considered `Freeze`, which sounds right to me too.\n",
