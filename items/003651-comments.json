This is a case where my work on suppressing derived errors wasn't doing the trick; I've extended it a bit, but the output still doesn't look as good as I'd hope. Third, the spans (which are what tell the pretty-printer where to put the squiggly lines) are wrong. (I have no idea why).\n\nI'm working on it!\n",
