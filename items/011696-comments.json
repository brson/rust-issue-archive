    "body": "This is because we implement a \"red zone\" of stack at then end of a green thread's stack, and the red zone has size 20K. The thread is considered to have overflowed its stack once it enters the red zone. Obviously it's bad that the entire stack is considered the red zone.\n\nI'm nominating this because I think this warrants discussion about what to do in this situation. The red zone allows `rust_stack_exhausted` to run as well as run any user-defined dtors near the end of the stack. If you specify a stack size that's less than the `RED_ZONE` size, then should you abort when you overflow the stack unconditionally? Should the red zone just be smaller?\n\nDecisions, decisions...\n",
