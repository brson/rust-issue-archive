    "body": "This is actually pretty simple to fix. Right now we select the type based on, mostly, the overall alignment of the type. We're also basically assuming that an alignment-sized integer is big enough to fit all discriminants in, what happens is that the alignment for a 64-bit integer on a 32-bit platform is 4 bytes, so we end up using a 4-byte integer for discriminant.\n\nThe easiest fix is to just skip the calculation for the discriminant type altogether when we have an repr attribute on the enum. A slightly better one might be to only allow the calculation to extend the int type to a larger size.\n",

In the case covered by this issue, it seems to me like the discriminant should be bigger than the alignment, since the alignment will be 4 bytes but we want the discriminant to be 8 bytes. But this means that `align_s % discr_size` is 4, not 0, which fails the `assert!`. I'm a little nervous about changing that check though, since it's outside of the area of code that you linked, and I'm not totally sure why it's there in the first place. Should I change it? If so, what should I change it to? My thought was to maybe only do that check if `align_s` is greater than `discr_size`.\n",

    "body": "@devonhollowood yeah, that'll need to be changed. I think the assertion is supposed to be ensuring that the alignment of the type is an integer multiple of the alignment of the discriminant, and is assuming that the alignment of an integer and the size of an integer are the same (which isn't true). Specifically, I think it's there to protect against a problem I encountered where I was accidentally increasing the size of the enum by using a too-large discriminant.\n\nIt should probably be `let discr_align = machine::align_of_alloc(cx, discr_ty);` and then `assert_eq!(align_s % discr_align, 0);`. I think `align_of_alloc` exists, if not take a look in the `machine` module and there should be an function that looks right.\n",

    "body": "Okay, I'm making a lot of progress on this. I've got a question about the expected behavior, though. What should the output of this program be?\n\n``` rust\n\ufeff\ufeff#[repr(u64)]\nenum Eu64NonCLike<T> {\n    _None,\n    _Some(T),\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"{}\", std::mem::size_of::<Eu64NonCLike<u8>>());\n}\n```\n\nOn 64-bit, I think the output should be `16`, because the struct should have 8 bytes for the discriminant, 1 byte for the `u8` in the `_Some(T)` variant, and then 7 bytes of padding to bring the total size up to the next multiple of the alignment (align = 8 bytes, so the next multiple of the alignment is 16).\n\nOn 32-bit, it seems like the same logic would imply that the output should be `12` (align = 4 bytes, so you only need an extra 3 bytes of padding to bring the total size up to 12 bytes, which is the next multiple of the alignment). This diverges the behavior for 32-bit and 64-bit builds, and I just wanted to double check that that was okay here.\n",
