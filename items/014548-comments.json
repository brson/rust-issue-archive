    "body": "In cases such as libsyntax with the ast, you generally have to import so many things that it's easier to just refer to everything via `ast::Foo` (at least so I've found), because maintaining the import lists at the top of the file are sometimes a bit painful. The other imports for things like `codemap` are find to expand to their individual components I think.\n\nAlso, is #11983 the issue you meant to refer to? It seems to reference libstd rather than libsyntax. Thanks for doing this by the way!\n",

    "body": "The issue is the one that I wanted to refer to, because at some point, someone mentions doing this in the compiler in addition to simply in the library. And I think the library is mostly clean already.\n\nAnd I'll switch to using `ast::Foo` instead of `use` statements for identifiers that are used a small number of times and probably retain use statements for those that are used a lot.\n\nAs for the philosophy of glob imports, I'm interested in seeing what this ends up looking like inside the rust compiler, since once they are removed from there, it's possible to see an example of a large codebase without globs and will help determine the usefulness of the feature.\n\nI'll keep the pull request open and push to it for feedback as I work more on it.\n",
