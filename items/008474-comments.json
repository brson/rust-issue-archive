    "body": "To make this work, we just build a task struct, put it in TLS, and that is it? I guess we have a ThreadTask enum in the task_type field. The \"start\" function would be a bit different, and we could leave out the Coroutine.  \n\nThe hard part here might be refactoring Task to permit three whole task types. With only two that share almost every field things are pretty easy, but with three more fields should end up inside TaskType which means more syntactically kludgey accessor functions.\n",
