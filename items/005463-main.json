  "body": "This is a minor step towards #3571, although I'm sure there's still more work to be done. Previously, `fmt!` collected a bunch of strings in a vector and then called `str::concat`. This changes the behavior by maintaining only one buffer and appending directly into that buffer. This avoids doubly-allocating memory, and it has the added bonus of reducing some allocations in `core::unstable::extfmt`\n\nOne of the unfortunate side effects of this is that the `rt` module in `extfmt.rs` had to be duplicated to avoid `stage0` errors. Dealing with the change in conversion functions may require a bit of a dance when a snapshot happens, but I think it's doable.\n\nIf the second speedup commit isn't deemed necessary, I got about a 15% speedup with just the first patch which doesn't require any modification of `extfmt.rs`, so no snapshot weirdness.\n\nHere's some other things I ran into when looking at `fmt!`:\n- I don't think that #2249 is relevant any more except for maybe removing one of `%i` or `%d`\n- I'm not sure what was in mind for using traits with #3571, but I thought that formatters like `%u` could invoke the `to_uint()` method on the `NumCast` trait, but I ran into some problems like those in #5462\n\nI'm having trouble thinking of other wins for `fmt!`, but if there's some suggestions I'd be more than willing to look into if they'd work out or not.\n",
