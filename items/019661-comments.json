    "body": "cc @wycats @nikomatsakis \n\nWe don't necessarily have to add this now, but it seems like you might want some additional flexibility:\n- The ability to recover use of a lock after it has been poisoned. For example, if you overwrite the data protected by the lock with a new value.\n- Possibly, the ability to read from a poisoned lock. This could be done by returning the previously-held data as part of the `Err` component -- basically alerting you to the fact that the data is suspect due to another thread's panic, but not preventing you from accessing it outright. Of course, you can work around this by protecting something like `()` and having the real data stored in an `UnsafeCell`, but that's not very ergonomic.\n\nWhat do you think about these cases?\n\nAs an aside, I still feel slightly uneasy about the division of places where we try to help with exception safety and places where we don't. For example, a function down the stack could panic while using an `&mut` reference to data that is owned higher up the stack, and the latter's destructor will see it in whatever state it was left in. Granted, in that case you're talking purely about destructors during unwinding, whereas with mutexes the data may be seen at an arbitrary point in time. But it would be good to try to lay out the distinction very clearly, in docs or a blog post or something.\n",

    "body": "Thinking more on this, I may be personally leaning more towards removing poisoning altogether or moving it to an opt-in primitive. For example, I can think of a few drawbacks:\n- In returning `Result`, I forgot that you can ignore the result of `Condvar::wait` which means you can read stale data even though it's been panicked over. This seems like a blocker for this PR.\n- We could plausibly add `PoisonError::replace`, but this causes a bit of a schism in the `RWLock` api. For example the error type on `read()` would have to be different than `write()` (you can only `replace` on the write lock). It also means that the `PoisonError` itself would have to carry the payload of the lock guard, which may mean that it's difficult to use with `try!` as it means that the type can't implement `Error` and you'd have to get rid of the borrowed reference quickly to propagate upwards.\n- I, too, am a bit worried that we have poisoning on a `Mutex` but not a `RefCell`, for example. We've said in the past that intra-task inspection of stale state is semi-ok (why `RefCell` doesn't poison) while inter-task inspection is bad (which is why `Mutex` panics). All these issues about panicking and recovering from this with a `Mutex` and `RWLock` seem too tricky to stabilize on, however.\n",

    "body": "Currently we're not planning on stabilizing the `try_*` variants of methods on `RefCell` due to them being against our [current conventions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0236-error-conventions.md#do-not-provide-both-result-and-fail-variants) of not providing both variants. For `RefCell` I believe we plan on adding some `is_borrowed` or related methods to query the state, and then an action can be taken.\n\nUnfortunately the same logic cannot necessarily be applied to synchronization primitives because you're unable to perform an atomic \"is this ready to go, ok let's go\" operation. As a result, we _must_ provide functionality as one method, and our conventions dictate that the method must return a `Result` (the more general of the two).\n\nThe `Mutex` and `RefCell` types are pretty different in their use cases despite their similarities. For example a `RefCell` was chosen to panic by default because it's believed that its usage is quite common, and `.borrow().unwrap()` would simply be untenable. When contrasted with `Mutex`, it's actually fairly rare to use a `Mutex`. Additionally, there's an intrinsic pressure to _reduce_ the number of calls to `lock()` already (for less serialization), but this pressure does not really exist for `RefCell`. As a result, the usage of `Mutex` is actually somewhat uncommon (depending on your application of course).\n\nConsequently, this PR chooses to have mutexes return results (and later have [channels return results](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/20273)]) due to the relatively uncommon usage of the primitives, and the richness of information that the error type can convey.\n\nIf we were to ignore our convention in this respect, and still provide both variants, this also generates a very real naming problem. For example channels right now use `foo` and `foo_opt` as the names of the pair of methods, but this is seen as inadequate (`_opt` has nothing to do with options). The `try_` prefix cannot be used because for synchronization primitives it has a different meaning than `RefCell` in that it generally means \"this does not block.\" By sticking to our conventions we sidestep this question altogether and create what's actually a pretty uniform interface across all primitives.\n\nWe definitely do not want to create \"needless ergonomic regressions\" when stabilizing primitives, we try to always focus on enhancing functionality and having primitives adhere to existing conventions. This change is directly aligning with our error conventions, and it is clearly indicating the semantics of locks which may have been somewhat hidden before.\n",
