Note that compiletest-rs has been taken out of the tree unofficially [here](https://github.com/laumann/compiletest-rs), so that implementation might give some pointers.\n\n(compiletest is the test runner for the stuff you find in `tests/`, and it lets us specify error patterns amongst other things.

    "body": "Running cfail tests is currently all managed through the in-tree `compiletest` binary, which we do not distribute out of tree (and probably do not want to). I would personally recommend start out getting standalone test cases to work before rustdoc test cases, but at a high level this may be the most plausible course of action:\n1. Move compiletest to using 100% stable code. This way an out-of-tree copy could be created/kept up to date which can compile against stable Rust. Eventually this could perhaps become a Cargo package and/or dependency.\n2. Move much of compiletest support to a library instead of an executable. This will allow rustdoc to link against it when running doc tests.\n3. Modify rustdoc to detect cfail test blocks and run the compiler, calling into compiletest to parse the compiler output and check everything is A-OK.\n\nHope that helps!\n",
