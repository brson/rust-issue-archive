    "body": "It was also suprising for me to find out that there is no 'legitimate' way of conversion unsized data from one smart pointer to another (or maybe I just did not find it?), because from the naive point of view this is kind of simplest operation (move the pointer and that's it). Even for sized types, if I understood the code correctly, in `impl From<Box<T>> for Arc<T>` it is copying the data itself (not the pointer) to the new location. The consequence is that library authors stick with things like `Arc<Box<TraitObject>>` which is one more (unnecessary) indirection level. Is it 'OK by design' or maybe there are plans to fix it?\n",

In my naive world it would be rather a tuple `(pointer to refcounts, pointer to data)` and in that case, I guess, consuming a `Box` into refrence-counted pointer would be trivial. But at the same time it would lead to some downsides (more values to pass between functions, more `malloc`s, maybe worse cache locality etc), so it is trade-off. Another question, how is it implemented in C++'s `shared_ptr`? Thanks @alexcrichton @bluss for comments!\n",

As an optimization, these two allocations can be fused together if the pointer was created with `make_shared`. Rust doesn't support two allocation mode, so `A(Rc)` can't adopt stray pointers.\n",
