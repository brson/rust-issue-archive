    "body": "@thinkpad20 Hi, I know you solved your problem, but I would like to explain why the first code didn't work. Apologies if you already figured this out, but maybe it'll help somebody else that stumbles across this issue.\n\nFor a start `let foo = |x| x*x` actually creates a closure, which is an anonymous function that potentially captures it's environment and assigns it to `foo`. Now, you might still be wondering why you couldn't call `foo` from inside that closure, after all, it is assigned to a variable. An example will help to explain:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n  let foo = |x:int| x*x; // This creates a closure assigned to foo\n\n  let foo = |x,y| {\n    foo(x) + foo(y) // Which foo gets called?\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can use `let` to introduce a new variable, and Rust really doesn't mind if it's the same name as a previous variable, as long as you don't mind not being able to access the previous variable any more. For this reason, captured variables in a closure are resolved _before_ being assigned in an assignment expression. This provides a single rule for knowing which variables get captured when and where. In the above example, the first `foo` closure is captured by the second `foo` closure. A different rule would introduce ambiguity.\n\nAgain, apologies if you already worked this out but it doesn't hurt to have another explanation floating around.\n",
