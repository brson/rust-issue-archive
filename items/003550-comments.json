    "body": "We were so close to figuring it out! That vec::each change has, in fact, made it in, and it also turns out that `()` binds more tightly than `*`. So this works:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let functions = [\n        || io::println(\"LOL FIRST\"),\n        || io::println(\"LOL SECOND\")\n    ];\n\n    for functions.each |func| {\n        (*func)();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThough if you're calling func multiple times inside the loop you should probably reassign it for convenience:\n\n```\n    for functions.each |func| {\n        let func = *func;\n        func();\n    }\n```\n\nThis still feels a little grody, though. Niko has noted a potential solution for this in https://github.com/graydon/rust-www/pull/1, via supporting infallible matching in parameter lists. That would enable you to write it a bit more naturally:\n\n```\n    for functions.each |&func| {\n        func();\n    }\n```\n\n@nikomatsakis, would you mind opening an issue for infallible matching in parameter lists, so it doesn't get forgotten? I get the feeling that people are going to keep stumbling/grumbling over this.\n",
