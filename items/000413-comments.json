    "body": "I've been talking to pcwalton about this and he's of the opinion that we should do these unsafe operators through library functions, via intrinsics, some of which we already have and use. I can see the advantage of that, in that it's easier than supporting more language features. It does demand cross-crate inlining though.\n\nIn either case we still need a way to mark the boundaries of unsafety.\n\nI believe what he likes, and what I agree seems nice, is that:\n\n1) Native and intrinsics are implicitly unsafe\n2) Functions that are declared unsafe may call other unsafe functions\n3) Functions that are not declared unsafe may wrap calls to unsafe functions in unsafe blocks, thereby wrapping the unsafety in safety\n\nI think this closely parallels what we're doing with purity/checking; if not it should.\n",
