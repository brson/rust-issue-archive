  "body": "This removes all the code from libextra that depends on libuv. After that it removes three runtime features that existed to support the global uv loop: weak tasks, runtime-global variables, and at_exit handlers.\n\nThe networking code doesn't have many users besides servo, so shouldn't have much fallout. The timer code though is useful and will probably break out-of-tree code until the new scheduler lands, but I expect that to be soon.\n\nIt also incidentally moves `os::change_dir_locked` to `std::unstable`. This is a function used by test cases to avoid cwd races and in my opinion shouldn't be public (#7870).\n\nCloses #7251 and #7870\n",
