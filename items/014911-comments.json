    "body": "My second comment brings me onto something else... I don't think this method is particularly useful; it's just a constrained version of the `advance` method (`advance` can `break`, `for_each` cannot) which itself is a constrained version of `for` (`for` can `return` from the outer function, `advance` cannot). _And_ `advance` is essentially a relic of the old `for` loops, which may be removed. \n\nI'm personally quite happy writing `for` loops for side-effect only behaviours.\n",

Do his arguments apply to Rust as well? Maybe this is too philosophical...\n\nThere is an interesting discussion at the end of the article, where arguments in favor of `ForEach` are given as well.
