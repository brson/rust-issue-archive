    "body": "Modern platforms have explicit support for this thanks to C++11, but there will need to be a slow path for older platforms. For example, OS X provides `_tlv_atexit` and glibc has `__cxa_thread_atexit_impl`. Rust needs support for selecting code based on the minimum platform version. The slow path can lock a global mutex on the first access to a TLS variable in a new thread and set up a dynamic TLS entry via an API like `pthread_key_create`.\n\nThe normal accesses will go through the static `thread_local` but dynamic TLS will take care of running destructors. The nightly Linux and OS X builds would need to use this slow path, but distribution builds will use the fast path. It's not worth trying to detect this at runtime because it will only happen once per TLS variable in a thread.\n",
