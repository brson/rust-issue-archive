The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @pcwalton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

This PR is too big, and it implicitly makes a bunch of decisions which need to be separately discussed.\n\nA few other comments:\n- it isn't clear what you're trying to do with `target_family`; making it open-ended doesn't seem useful at first glance.\n- It's probably worth reading https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1291 if you're going to suggest changes to libc.\n- Does using libstd actually make sense in your environment?  Environments without a C runtime can use libcore (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27701).\n",
