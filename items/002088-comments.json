    "body": "Yes, it's a deliberate design feature of Rust that we allow late initialization, so \"let\" without an '=' is not an error. (It's only an error to use a variable that isn't initialized on every incoming control path, like you saw.)\n\nThanks for the suggestion. I'll try to improve the error message. The info that is there right now is mainly for debugging purposes for implementors -- I never thought it was going to be useful for users, and always meant to improve the error messages, but it's just that no one has asked for that until now :-)\n",

    "body": "What I was hoping to do was two things:\n\n1) translate the code-span information into a quoted line, so that you\ncould see what was causing the error, rather than the line and\ncharacter number\n\n2) understand the constraints system well enough to apply a debug\nstring to each class of constraint as applied, so that when you find\nthat it is violated, you just throw out the debug string as a guide to\nuser comprehension.  I think that my mistake here was to think of\nconstraints as classes of things; I couldn't get to the level of\nunderstanding of the implementation necessary to figure out what was\ngoing on.  The basic thing that I did was to add a string part to the\nninit record, but then it was difficult to trace where and why ninit\nrecords were being created, and there were a lot of cases where the\ndebug string was something like 'get this to fail and then fix'.  I\nam, overall, not sure that it's a sound approach.\n\nOf course, tried to do #2 first, which I think led to the failure.  I\nneeded to understand too much, and didn't want to bug you, and then I\nran out of time.\n\nLooking forward to the commits for this, and am happy to do any\ntesting on it if that would help.\n\nOn Thu, Apr 19, 2012 at 12:44 PM, Tim Chevalier\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @evanmcc No problem -- if you have a patch, even a partial one, feel free to submit a pull req, but otherwise I'll do it.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/2088#issuecomment-5230267\n",
