    "body": "> It looks like `linker_is_gnu` is turned on for many BSD platforms as well, do you know if this typically works over there?\n\nNot authoritatively, but the interwebs are showing me man pages for GNU ld when I look for NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Dragonfly ld manpages, and all those manpages mention `--enable-new-dtags`. I'm less  easily finding info on bitrig (they're using clang, I think, but probably not lld?). The only other `linker_is_gnu` target is le32-unknown-nacl, which I believe is also a GNU toolchain.\n\n> Is this a new-enough option that a rustc-generated binary would no longer run on a super-ancient system? (e.g. the Rust compiler we're shipping, would it not run on systems like CentOS 5.5?)\n\nAs @aatch mentioned, yeah, the flag was added to glibc in 1999. So it's fine for every CentOS ever. Also, even if the dynamic linker doesn't support it, the effect is that rpaths don't work but the binary is otherwise fine; it doesn't create an un-runnable binary. (That said, GNU ld used to emit both `DT_RPATH` and `DT_RUNPATH` for compatibility until 2.24, which is recent enough to be in Ubuntu 14.04. In turn, ld.so ignores `DT_RPATH` if `DT_RUNPATH` is around.)\n\n> Do you know when this option was added to the linker?\n\n[July 2000](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=blob;f=ld/ChangeLog-0001;hb=refs/tags/binutils-2_25#l2511), probably binutils 2.11 if I'm guessing right.\n\nThe trouble with naming a feature \"new\" is that it's going to continue to be named \"new\" for decades. :)\n",
