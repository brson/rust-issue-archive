    "body": "I went through the lints I could find in the compiler and checked the following, as per [RFC 344](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0344-conventions-galore.md):\n- Lint names should make sense when read as \"allow `lint-name`\" or \"allow `lint-name` items\".\n- Lint names should state the bad thing being checked for.\n- Lints that apply to arbitrary items should not have a category in their name.\n- Lints that mention a grammatical class should mention said class and use the plural form.\n- Lints that catch redundant constructs should use the term \"unused\".\n- Use snake case.\n\nIn addition I added another rule: \n- Words should not be abbreviated.  Language keywords **may** be excepted.  This rule was derived from common usage of un-abbreviated forms of words.\n\nI have tried to apply these as blindly as possible, even in cases where I feel the lint name is perfectly reasonable, just to ensure each lint's name is considered for any possible infraction.\n\nAnd yes, I know they're guidelines, not _rules_... but guidelines are really just loosely enforced rules.  :P\n\n# Lints Checked\n\nComments are included only in cases of problems or suggestions.\n\n## `src/librustc/lint/builtin.rs`\n- `box_pointers`\n  \n  What about `rc_pointers`/`arc_pointers`?  What's the actual goal with this lint?\n- `dead_code`\n- `deprecated`\n- `exceeding_bitshifts`\n  \n  This reads as \"allow bitshifts which exceed\", which seems a strange phrasing without indicating what is being exceeded.\n  \n  Possible alternative: `width_exceeding_bitshifts`.\n- `fat_ptr_transmutes`\n  \n  The \"`ptr`\" abbreviation is **not** used in other lints.  For consistency, it should be renamed, or all other lints mentioning pointers should be renamed to use the abbreviation.  It is worth noting, however, that abbreviations appear to be relatively uncommon in lint names.\n  \n  Rename to `fat_pointer_transmutes`?\n  \n  A side issue is that I'm not aware of \"fat pointer\" being a concept in the language, as presented to users.  If I understand correctly, this is only ever going to apply to DST pointers.  In this case, perhaps it should be renamed further.\n  \n  Rename to `dst_pointer_transmutes`?\n  \n  I'm excepting `dst` from the \"no abbreviations\" rule because `dynamically_sized_type_pointer_transmutes` feels a bit too verbose.\n- `improper_ctypes`\n  \n  This implies the problem is with `ctypes`.  In truth, the problem is that you're using something which is _not_ flagged `#[repr(ctype)]` where it _should_ be, or a type which may not have a well-defined meaning in C.\n  \n  Possible alternatives: `non_ffi_safe_types`, `ffi_unsafe_types`.\n- `missing_copy_implementations`\n- `missing_debug_implementations`\n- `missing_docs`\n  \n  There's an unusual abbreviation in \"`docs`\".\n  \n  Rename to `missing_documentation`?\n- `non_camel_case_types`\n- `non_shorthand_field_patterns`\n- `non_snake_case`\n- `non_upper_case_globals`\n  \n  This _actually_ checks non-`mut` `static`s and `const`s, which are not _necessarily_ global.  In fact, it explicitly _does not_ check mutable `static`s, although those may be going away soon.\n  \n  Rename to `non_upper_case_constants`?\n- `overflowing_literals`\n- `path_statements`\n  \n  I'm unsure, but should this be `unused_path_expressions`?  It's about a piece of code that doesn't do anything.  I feel this name is also _marginally_ clearer than the current one, which initially confused me.\n- `private_no_mangle_fns`\n  \n  Another case of an un-delineated adjective having a slightly weird reading.  Not wrong, just weird.\n  \n  Possible alternative: `private_non_mangled_fns`.\n- `raw_pointer_derive`\n  \n  This one violates the plural rule, and is also inelegantly named in general.  The problem suggests that the problem is `derive`-ing the implementation _of_ a raw pointer, rather than the implementation _of something containing_ a raw pointer.\n  \n  Sadly, a more accurate name would likely be \"raw pointer-containing derived implementations\", which is a little unwieldy.\n  \n  Possible alternatives: `derive_involving_raw_pointers` (sort-of violates plural class rule), `raw_pointer_derive_implementations` (to be consistent with existing uses of un-abbreviated word), `derive_using_raw_pointers`.\n- `unconditional_recursion`\n- `unknown_crate_types`\n- `unknown_lints`\n- `unreachable_code`\n- `unsafe_blocks`\n- `unsigned_negation`\n- `unstable_features`\n- `unused_allocation`\n  \n  This violates the plural rule.\n  \n  Rename to: `unused_allocations`?\n  \n  As an aside, I can't work out what this one is actually checking for... it mentions `ty::AutoPtr`, but I don't know what that is.\n- `unused_assignments`\n- `unused_attributes`\n- `unused_comparisons`\n- `unused_extern_crates`\n- `unused_features`\n- `unused_import_braces`\n- `unused_imports`\n- `unused_must_use`\n  \n  This one fits the rules, but comes across as confusing.\n  \n  Possible alternatives: `unused_must_use_values`, `unused_values_marked_must_use`.\n- `unused_mut`\n  \n  This violates the plural rule.\n  \n  Possible alternatives: `unused_muts`, `unused_mutability`.\n- `unused_parens`\n  \n  \"`parens`\" is not a keyword, and thus its abbreviation is inconsistent.\n  \n  Rename to `unused_parentheses`?\n- `unused_qualifications`\n- `unused_results`\n  \n  An aside: at first, I thought this was referring to `Result`.  `unused_expressions` or `unused_expression_results` would be clearer, though much longer.\n- `unused_typecasts`\n  \n  I'm on the fence about this.  I've never used \"typecast\" as a word in this context before, but Wikipedia does list it as a synonym for \"type conversion\".  My other thought is: \"if there are type casts, what other kinds of cast are they distinct from?\"\n  \n  I'm not aware of any other kind of \"cast\" in Rust at the language level, so should this be `unused_casts`?\n- `unused_unsafe`\n  \n  This violates the plural rule, applies to a specific item but doesn't mention it, and is inconsistent with the existence of `unsafe_blocks`.\n  \n  Rename to `unused_unsafe_blocks`?\n- `unused_variables`\n- `variant_size_differences`\n  \n  The description says that it checks for variants which have \"widely\" different sizes, but that's not reflected in the name.\n  \n  Possible alternative: `excessive_variant_size_differences`.\n- `warnings`\n- `while_true`\n  \n  Applies to a specific item, but doesn't mention it.  That said, you could also argue that it applies to _exactly_ one thing, thus it shouldn't be plural.\n  \n  Rename to `while_true_loops`?\n\n## `src/librustc/lint/context.rs`\n- Group `bad_style`\n- Group `unused`\n",

    "body": "@pnkfelix I considered that, but my concern is that `?Sized` doesn't mean \"unsized\", it means \"not statically sized\".  I know there have been requests for Rust to gain _actually_ unsized types for things like C strings, which would be thin pointers.\n\nAlso, just to be clear, I'm uncertain whether I should just go ahead with the proposed changes, and make a PR, move all this into an RFC, or keep this here.  Honestly, the RFC thing only _just_ occurred to me since it was \"oh, this is fixing stuff that doesn't match the already accepted guidelines\" as opposed to \"let's deliberately break everything\".

    "body": "Regarding the interaction with stable Rust, I think that we should adopt a plan like this:\n- All stable code can use any lint that it wants to.\n- We should add an option to rustc that caps all lints at _warn_.\n- Cargo should supply this option when building dependencies or installing software\n  - This might be configurable in the `Cargo.toml` file\n\nThe idea here is that if I am using somebody's package, I don't want to have compilation fail because we added a new lint in the meantime. But if I am editing my own source code, I absolutely _do_ want compilation to fail. I feel like this bridges the gap and avoids the problem of `-Wall` not being able to refer to \"all\".\n",

If rustc silently accepts lints that don't exist and thus don't do anything, the user can accidentally mistype the name of an important lint they care about and think they're being protected by it, when in fact no such protection is present.\n",
