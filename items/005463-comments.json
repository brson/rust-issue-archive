    "body": "I tried to do something like that by passing the string buffer to as many functions as possible, but to account for things like padding and numbers being generated from right-to-left, I'm not sure how many more intermediate strings can be eliminated.\n\nRight now the only intermediate string is actually when formatting numbers, and I found it difficult to change that because of the way the numbers are generated, and then also having to deal with padding. For other things, strings always have to copy memory, bools copy from static memory, and poly conversions have the same problem as numbers where to do padding the intermediate form is necessary.\n\nOne thing I can try is a sort of \"fast path\" for conversions which don't have any padding, because those can mostly just be emitted directly into the string buffer. That would probably require a lot of changes though, so I'll open another pull request later with that if this goes through.\n",

    "body": "Bors takes care of this just fine as far as I can tell. I just takes this series of commits (whatever is current) and plants it on top of incoming, naming the result 'auto'. I've had a couple pull requests in the past which you just have to continually rebase to keep up with merge conflicts.\n\nIn this case, bors dealt with it twice, but both had build failures (which should be fixed now). This should be ready for another go at this point.\n",
