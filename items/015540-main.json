  "body": "Removing recursion from TreeMap implementation, because we don't have TCO. No need to add `O(logn)` extra stack frames to search in a tree.\n\nI find it curious that `find_mut` and `find` basically duplicated the same logic, but in different ways (iterative vs recursive), possibly to maneuvre around mutability rules, but that's a more fundamental issue to deal with elsewhere.\n\nThanks to acrichto for the magic trick to appease borrowck (another issue to deal with elsewhere).\n",
