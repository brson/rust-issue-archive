    "body": "At the moment, `for` loops are documented as part of the [iterator tutorial](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/guide-container.html#iterators). I don't think introducing the `for` loop in isolation is enough because you need to be exposed to the `iter` methods on containers too, or it's just tempting you to try `for x in container { }` and hit an obscure error message.\n\nThis may be something we should cover in the main tutorial, but I don't think we should have a section on `for` loops alone, and I don't think we should have coverage in the tutorial, the iterator module _and_ a separate guide that's apparently not discoverable.\n",

    "body": "Well, it is discoverable, I figured it out pretty quickly. (I did try the container, too, of course...)  I sort of just expect a tutorial to be self-contained. And I wondered about how to do that while reading this section immediately. And I suspect many people with a background in other languages will wonder about that. It is somewhat less than optimal to sort of imply traits and iterators in that context, for sure. But then again, the tutorial does that on multiple occasion as far as I remember.\n\nbtw, I'm coming mainly from a Python background, where for loops are introduced right away without explaining the iterator protocol. However, iterators and collections are mostly interchangable there, which appears to be not the case for Rust (yet?).\n",

    "body": "@thestinger what if, in addition to the `range` example provided in the current commit, we also provided a concrete example of a `for` loop that needs to call a method on a collection?\n\nIts too early in the tutorial to bring in `vec`, so I was thinking maybe something like this:\n\n> There is also a `for` loop that can be used to iterate over a series of values.  One such series is a range of numbers:\n> \n> ``` rust\n> for n in range(0, 5) {\n>    println!(\"{}\", n);\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> The snippet above prints integer numbers under 5 starting at 0.\n> \n> More generally, a `for` loop works with anything implementing the `Iterator` trait.  Data structures can provide one or more methods that return iterators over their contents.  For example, strings support iteration over their contents in various ways:\n> \n> ``` rust\n> let s = \"Hello\";\n> for c in s.chars() {\n>     println!(\"{}\", c);\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> The snippet above prints the characters in `\"Hello\"` vertically, adding a new line after each character.\n\nAnd then arguably we might also add a line to the \"Vectors and strings\" section mentioning the `vec` methods `iter`, `split` and the `str` methods `bytes`, `chars`, `words`, `nfd_chars`, ending the non-exhaustive lists of methods with some text like \"and various others\" (so that one gets a taste of why using methods makes sense, without spelling it out as such).\n\nTo me something like the above still seems somewhat lightweight, so that it doesn't need its own section, but it hits the main concerns that you are raising, I think.\n",
