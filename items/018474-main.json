  "body": "As part of the collections reform RFC, this commit removes all collections\ntraits in favor of inherent methods on collections themselves. All methods\nshould continue to be available on all collections.\n\nThis is a breaking change with all of the collections traits being removed and\nno longer being in the prelude. In order to update old code you should move the\ntrait implementations to inherent implementations directly on the type itself.\n\nNote that some traits had default methods which will also need to be implemented\nto maintain backwards compatibility.\n\n[breaking-change]\ncc #18424\n",
