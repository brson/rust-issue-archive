    "body": "Nice test! Sorry for being so pedantic about these, but this feels like an extra level of unsafety I want to be sure we tread carefully with. To me there are a bunch more `unsafe impl` blocks than I would have expected originally. I would consider something like the following steps for considering whether to mark something with `unsafe impl`:\n1. Are there any interior unsafe pointers or `UnsafeCell` types? If not, then the problem lies in the constituent types, not at the top-level.\n2. Can any unsafe pointers be represented by other abstractions? For example `Unique` is one but there may be other helper structs as well.\n\nAlong those lines, some of the structures marked with `unsafe impl` fall into (1) where they don't contain unsafe things and the problem seems to lie in the underlying abstractions. I think we already got all the instances of (2).\n\nDoes that make sense?\n",
