    "body": "Just two cents from a user here. From what I have seen in other language the \"batteries not included\" approach can be quite frustrating. In node for example many very simple things require a package, and since there isn't really a list of packages blessed by the core language team or even by the community, newcomers can end up having to try many packages of dubious quality before they find one that fits. I can fully understand the fact that you need to reduce the scope to stabilize the core ASAP, but I hope you keep this in mind and think of a strategy for the future. \n\nEither create a rust organization on github where blessed packages can be moved to, or maybe even rebuild a libextra later where popular and proven packages can be pulled in to form a stronger base language distribution (kind of like in PHP where anything you can possibly want is included, though I don't think we'd need to go as far).\n",
