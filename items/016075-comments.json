    "body": "We also use a `Result` typedef in `std::fmt`. If you feel that using a `Result` typedef here is confusing because `std::result::Result` is in the prelude, then you should file an issue about it and try to come up with a general solution.\n\nOffhand, we could perhaps have rustdoc detect when a type shadows something in the prelude and adjust instances of that shadowing type to include the module name, e.g. `fmt::Result` instead of `Result`.\n\nIncidentally, if you look at the `std::fmt` documentation right now you'll actually see `Result<(), FormatError>` instead of `Result`. This is a bug, rustdoc is inlining type definitions in some cases. If the bug is fixed it would display `Result` just like `getopts` does.\n",
