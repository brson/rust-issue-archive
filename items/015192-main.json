  "body": "The JSON spec requires that these special values be serialized as \"null\"; the current serialization breaks any conformant JSON parser. So encoding needs to output \"null\",  `to_json` on floating-point types can return `Null` as well as `Number` values, and reading a `Null` value when specifically expecting a number should be interpreted as NaN. There's no way to round-trip Infinity through JSON.\n\nThis is my first attempt at both writing Rust and opening pull requests, so please dial your derp detector up to eleven when reviewing. A `rustc --test lib.rs` in `libserialize` passes all tests; a `make check` of the whole tree fails with the error below, but it doesn't look obviously related and the docs say that `make check` is known to be flaky on Windows.\n\n```\n---- [compile-fail] compile-fail/svh-change-significant-cfg.rs stdout ----\n        task '[compile-fail] compile-fail/svh-change-significant-cfg.rs' failed at 'called `Result::\nunwrap()` on an `Err` value: couldn't create file (end of file (unknown error); path=i686-pc-mingw32\n\\test\\compile-fail\\svh-a-base.err; mode=truncate; access=write)', C:\\msys\\home\\Mike\\rust\\src\\libcore\n\\result.rs:545\n```\n\nIncidentally, it may just be my lack of familiarity with the language and its idioms, but the duplication between `Encoder`/`PrettyEncoder` had a distinct code smell to it. The size of the file (~3500 lines) also made it a bit hard to navigate. Has there been any discussion of refactoring and/or breaking it up? I couldn't find anything in Issues except the ancient #9028.\n",
