  "body": "This adds low level bindings for `glob()` and `globfree()` in `libc`, and adds a static `glob()` function to `Path` which uses those. It has only been tested on Linux/x86_64, but I looked up header file definitions for other platforms, so they should hopefully work in theory. Windows doesn't have these functions, so that is currently unimplemented, although ideally `Path::glob()` could be reimplemented in terms of Windows primitives instead, at some point in the future.\n\nI'm not sure what a good way to test this would be - it requires looking at the actual filesystem, so I'm not sure where a safe place to do that would be. I'd be willing to add some if people have recommendations.\n",
