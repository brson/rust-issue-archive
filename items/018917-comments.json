We do have some other related flags for printing like:\n\n```\n    --print-crate-name  Output the crate name and exit\n    --print-file-name   Output the file(s) that would be written if\n                        compilation continued and exit\n```\n\nso there is at least some precedent for the top level (but not necessarily good precedent)\n",
