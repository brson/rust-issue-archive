    "body": "This looks amazing, thanks!\n\nI think the only part about this we really need to think about is the name of the associated types (now that they're a public-facing API). The question of \"what should I name this\" will probably come up fairly frequently, so it would be good to have an answer. That being said, though, I'd rather land this now if we don't quite have an answer than take time to sort it out.\n",

    "body": "@japaric In case you didn't see on IRC: I just realized that using `Result` by default here is problematic because of the prelude, especially if we start bringing these into scope for the trait. `Output` seems like a good choice to avoid this problem.\n\nI'm sorry for not catching this earlier on :(\n\nHowever, I suspect that it should be easy to run a sed script over the patch itself to fix this. Feel free to squash into a single commit if that would make it easier.\n",
