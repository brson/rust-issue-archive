    "body": "Thanks for making progress on #6085! I'd like to discuss this before moving forward, because just using an `EnumSet` may not be the best solution. For example a `bitflags!` alternative to `EnumSet` was proposed in #13072.\n\nThis unfortunately suffers from \"libstd is what is needed to implement libstd\" rather than \"libstd is what it should be\", because it seems odd to have `EnumSet` in libstd. Hopefully we can mitigate this before merging!\n",
