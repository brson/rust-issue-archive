  "body": "Currently, the pretty printer prints the brackets for match arms (if they are blocks) on a new line. This means you get something like (omitting a bunch of repetitions to make it not all fit inline):\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    match h {\n      something =>\n      {\n          hello;\n          ...\n          hello;\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is because the block is printed with print_expr, which means the whole thing is wrapped inside of a box. What should happen is that the opening bracket should be in the head box with \"something =>\" (that's how it works elsewhere). With the code in this pull request, the same code is formatted as:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    match h {\n      something => {\n        hello;\n        ...\n        hello;\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhich seems better.\n\nEdit: Now that incoming is not burning, I can confirm that the code here does not cause any test failures. \n",
