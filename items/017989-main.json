  "body": "This improves the spectralnorm shootout benchmark through a few vectors after\nlooking at the leading C implementation:\n- The simd-based f64x2 is now used to parallelize a few computations\n- RWLock usage has been removed. A custom `parallel` function was added as a\n  form of stack-based fork-join parallelism. I found that the contention on the\n  locks was high as well as hindering other optimizations.\n\nThis does, however, introduce one `unsafe` block into the benchmarks, which\npreviously had none.\n\nIn terms of timings, the before and after numbers are:\n\n```\n$ time ./shootout-spectralnorm-before\n./shootout-spectralnorm-before  2.07s user 0.71s system 324% cpu 0.857 total\n$ time ./shootout-spectralnorm-before 5500\n./shootout-spectralnorm-before 5500  11.88s user 1.13s system 459% cpu 2.830 total\n$ time ./shootout-spectralnorm-after\n./shootout-spectralnorm-after  0.58s user 0.01s system 280% cpu 0.210 tota\n$ time ./shootout-spectralnorm-after 5500\n./shootout-spectralnorm-after 5500  3.55s user 0.01s system 455% cpu 0.783 total\n```\n",
