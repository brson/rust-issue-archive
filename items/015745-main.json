  "body": "Simplify example in 5.2 to remove hidden `#[deriving(Show)]`. Traits haven't been introduced yet and now it's easier to just type in the code and expect it to work. Add in some examples for constructing the enum types. Explicitly expose `#![feature(struct_variant)]` in the code to make it more transparent, this bit me when I worked through the tutorial.\n\nAdd references in chapter 8 to later chapters describing `Rc`, `Gc` and `Send`. This is a simple fix for #15293.\n\nSimplify vector indexing example in chapter 13 and removed hidden, unnecessary, code. Gave an example usage of the derived `Rand` trait in chapter 17.\n\nRemoved references to removed 'extra' crate.\n",
