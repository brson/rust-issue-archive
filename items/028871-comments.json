    "body": "So, while this example is a regression, the underlying problem is pre-existing. For example, [this test case](http://is.gd/djFOlS) shows the same conflict (note that the compilation error [goes away](http://is.gd/zkhsQy) if you change `<S as T>::T` in the trait definition to `S`, even though those ought to be the same). I'm not sure of the best fix overall, honestly, though lazy normalization as I've been envisioning it _could_ help here (but you'd have to add in a policy of \"apply all applicable where clauses\", which is perhaps fairly sane, modulo inference). I can imagine some shorter-term hacky fixes, which I will investigate, but it may also make sense to accept this regression as a pre-existing shortcoming of normalization (albeit one exacerbated by other bugfixes).\n\n@arcnmx I am curious whether you have some larger context for this minified example.\n",
