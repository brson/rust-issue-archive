    "body": "In the owned case, the note points to the exact location of where the move happened. It's true that the error messages are slightly different because they're exercising different properties of the language, but it would be great if in the `@` case it actually pointed at where the move happened in the case as well.\n\nCurrently if you have a match with ~20 arms and you make a large refactoring and all of a sudden one of the arms causes a move, it's sometimes difficult to track it down. I think that this issue is specific to just `match` in that it should point to the arm which was considered as having moved out.\n",
