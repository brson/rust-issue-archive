I think that they way the tests are printed right now is fine (in both the single and multithreaded cases), but the major problem is that tests which hang (in the multithreaded test case) never print anything out.\n\nThis is a problem on bors because it's never known which test actually caused the process to hang. I think that the best way to handle this would be to handle signals somehow. If the test harness could catch SIGINT/SIGTERM and terminate all running tests (or at least print out all currently running tests as failures and then exit the process), then at least the source of the failures would be known.\n\nNominating for the production-ready milestone.\n",

    "body": "@bagedevimo unfortunately I don't know of a great way to solve this, but I can at least describe the problem!\n\nThe crux of the problem here is that tests which deadlock or for some other reason don't finish never print anything by default, which means it's very difficult to debug what's going on if the test suite times out (e.g. is killed by an external process). Tests are by default run in multiple threads which is why we don't print partial output.\n\nSome possible solutions for this could be:\n- Use a library to have fancy control over terminal output, and make a better UI on top of that. For example you could have a status bar of all tests that have completed and then a line-per-thread which shows the status of the thread (e.g. if it's idle, what test it's running, etc). The terminal would then all get updated whenever anything completed. This is pretty fancy, however, and is unlikely to be fit for this repository itself unfortunately.\n- Set a timeout such that if no tests have completed after running for N seconds, the currently running tests are all printed to stdout. Either that or if any test itself is taking longer than 5 seconds, the test is printed to stdout. This would at least provide a status message which can be scraped to see what tests are running. This is unfortunately not very useful, however, if the test then later completes as it's just confusing output at that point.\n- A signal handler could be installed to catch termination of the test suite itself. This signal handler would then indicate to the test suite that it should print out all actively running tests and then exit. The hard part about this is (A) you have to deal with signal handlers and (B) it's unclear how well this would work on Windows (I don't think it would work for the buildbot case, but may work for the ctrl-c-at-terminal case).\n\nMy personal preference about how to tackle this would be to develop an awesome terminal-ui-test-runner externally so we can see how great it is, and then push really hard on custom test frameworks in Rust to ensure that the experience in using it is super smooth as well.\n\nSorry if that's not quite a concrete way of how to tackle this, but hopefully it's at least a start!\n",

    "body": "I think @alexcrichton's second solution is a reasonable and simple way to reduce the effect of this problem: the test runner should flag tests that run very slow, on the assumption that they are deadlocking. The main loop should keep a list of outstanding tests, their start times and whether they've already been flagged, and set a high receive timeout (maybe 60 seconds, maybe even higher). Every time through the loop it checks for outstanding tests that have exceeded the timeout and haven't been flagged yet, then prints something like \"test foo has been running for longer than 60 seconds\".\n\nWith a high timeout it's unlikely that there will be many false positives, though certainly there are some tests that take more than 60 seconds to run. What you think @alexcrichton?\n",
