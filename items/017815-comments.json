ContainsRecursive isn't considered an error; it doesn't need to be, because if the inner type were really illegally recursive, we'd catch that when we type check Option, and then we'd report Option as SelfRecursive. The ContainsRecursive check is meant to stop us from recursing through Option indefinitely, but did so incorrectly in this case.\n",
