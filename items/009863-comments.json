    "body": "Thanks for the pull request, and nice work! I think that @huonw has a valid point about the default error message for closures including a gated feature is probably not the best idea. Feature gating could be modified to return what features were enabled (and possibly stored in a side table somewhere), but I think that it's also possibly OK to not have the clause in the error message regardless. Additionally, once fns will probably be removed once the closure reform has happened.\n\nAdditionally, right now the commit process is that the pull request as a whole is landed against master, passes all tests, and then bakes for awhile. We create snapshots periodically, allowing us to update code which needed the snapshot. To land this, it may need to allow once fns by default for a window of time. I can make a snapshot right after this lands on master, but doing this in stages through multiple commits would be a little difficult.\n",
