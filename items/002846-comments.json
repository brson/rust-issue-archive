    "body": "The answer to my question appears to be no: if you tie a pull request to a commit, you can't change it later.\n\nThis is too bad. (I didn't like the other workflow, because if I rewrite history to squash the new commit onto the old one to keep it clean, the pull request forgets the old one ever existed. I thought maybe this would not do that. I guess to keep history in a pull request you have to keep the history of the commits and not squash them once it's filed.)\n",
