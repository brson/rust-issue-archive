    "body": "Also, I will go ahead and mention that I may begin working on this soon, as opposed to #1861, which is a much more tricky issue to get right. This issue covers plenty of use-cases on its own, IMO.\n\nI think the proposed scheme here is fine, personally, and I'll begin experimenting with it, but can I ask, @brson, how far away is a reality with compiler plugins? If it's not an incredible chore and there's a ticket about discussion/what people expect, it may be better to bite the bullet and implement that, and then start implementing this as a plugin. I agree the compiler is going to grow awfully complex if we start bundling all this stuff, so it may just be worth doing that first, and then coming back here (it also makes auto-binding generators, C code compilers, and all sorts of lint/analysis tools much more maintainable.)\n",

    "body": "Regarding plugins, there is no complete design, nor even general consensus that plugins are the way forward, so it will take some discussion and design work. pcwalton and dherman have recently been discussing how to overhaul the macro system, which is closely related. Most of the existing work being performed by extensions should not be directly coded into compiler, imo.\n\n#458 (dynamic loading) is a prerequisite. #1762 is about extracting the syntax extensions from the compiler.\n\nOne possible way to make progress on this issue while sidestepping the plugin issue would be to implement a separate tool that parses the appropriate attributes out of the crate, runs the C compiler, then uses #612 to merge `link_args` attributes into the crate. The tool would use librustc, so would be trivial to convert to a plugin (or merge into the compiler) later.\n",
