    "body": "`str` is not a \"mixture of a string of characters and a vector of bytes\" any more than an `int` is a mixture of a set of bits and a Pythagorean integer. A `str` is a unicode string in its most common and practical encoding, UTF-8.\n\nWe expose the encoding because it matters for a lot of operations, and the `str` APIs should be byte-oriented because that's much faster than counting characters. If you're worried about accidentally grabbing the middle of a UTF-8 code sequence, do as @kevina suggests and just take a look at the bit pattern of the boundary. Assert that you're not starting or stopping with a byte that has `10` as its high bits. UTF-8 is very well-designed for byte-access.\n\nProgrammers working in this sort of language are mature enough to know what UTF-8 is and accept its structure, just as they do the structure of `int`, `float`, pointers, and various other memory-resident entities. This is not a language of pure abstraction; concrete details matter.\n\nWe can (perhaps should) add a module `wstr` that deals with the other sometimes-desirable encoding `[char]`, that is, a vector of UCS4 codepoints. I doubt anyone aside from \"those interacting with the win32 API\" will want UTF-16, the other monstrous encoding you see in the wild. By far the most common (and practical) encoding is UTF-8, so it's what we chose for our `str` representation.\n\nAs far as this being \"unsafe\" for slicing, you can _always_ pass an invalid index to any vector-slice operator, say past-the-end or such. Bytes have nothing to do with it. You could decide to \"eat errors\" by wrapping around the string or something (is a silently-eaten error an error? very philosophical) but you could equally make up some kind of error-eating treatment for UTF-8 like \"start at the next char boundary\". I don't like error-eating behavior and would prefer to just tell programmers when they make mistakes.\n",

    "body": "> How does str::bytes::find or str::chars::find look?\n\nNo, no. This isn't what I intended -- we should be using chars as things to look for and act on, almost always, and a single set of operators is probably enough (fast paths can be baked in for when arguments are <128). Just the _offsets_ that are returned should be byte offsets, with a few utilities to convert between byte and char offsets for the (rare) cases where you need characters (say, counting the # of chars between two byte offsets).\n",
