  "body": "This test is designed to ensure that running a non-existent executable\nresults in a correct error message (FileNotFound in this case of this\ntest).  However, if you try to run an executable that doesn't exist, and\nthat requires searching through the $PATH, and one of the $PATH components\nis not readable, then a PermissionDenied error will be returned, instead\nof FileNotFound.\n\nUsing an absolute path skips the $PATH search logic in exec, thus by-passing the logic in exec that would have returned a PermissionDenied\n\nIn the specific case of my machine, /usr/bin/games was part of $PATH, but my user account wasn't in the games group (thus being unable to read /usr/bin/games)\n\nSee the man pages for execv and execve for more details.\n\nI've tested this on Linux and OSX, and I am fairly certain that there will be no problems on Windows\n",
