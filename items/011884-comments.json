Lots of contributors are web developers and wouldn't necessarily be able to contribute technical content. The other main part is Firefox/OS/Gecko/SpiderMonkey devs. They're more likely to contribute, but they're already few to document their product internals, I'm not sure how much contribution you'd get.\nMaybe for typos and editorial issues.\n\n> One alternative would be to create our own instance of MDN just for Rust.\n\nYes (I should have read your post earlier :-/)\n",
