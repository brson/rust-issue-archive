Associated consts are not object safe, just like associated (static) functions.\r\n2. Associated consts must all be specified, just like associated types.\r\n\r\nI think its sensible to start with the first. The second makes more sense in the context of a world with const params, but the first can be extended to the second.\r\n\r\nIt might also make sense some day to allow `where` clauses on associated consts just like methods (and on associated types, for that matter, which connects in some degree with the ATC RFC).",
