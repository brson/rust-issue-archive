None of the \"bundled\" packages are distributed as part of a rust installation, they're all statically linked into their respective rust artifacts. Other than that, this is the status of all our bundled repos:\n- LLVM - with `./configure --llvm-root=foo` you can use a system LLVM\n- libuv - we're currently using an unreleased version of libuv I believe, but it's also a fairly small dependency\n- gyp - this is just a build dependency of libuv, we can probably get by with a system version\n- compiler-rt - this is required by LLVM, it's a pretty small project, but we have a good number of custom patches on top that we need.\n",
