Like \"yes, inline it harder\". In my imagination the function calls to the outer functions shouldn't happen at all, i.e. argument conversions should exist \"outside\" of functions, like in C++, and `#[inline]` is supposed to reflect this in code.\n\n@alexcrichton \n\n> I would personally prefer to avoid this sort of manual conversion\n\nSure, doing this manually is not optimal. Instead of compiler \"magic\" @aturon suggested explicit, but very consice syntax https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blame/master/text/0529-conversion-traits.md#L271 which I like better. This patch is mostly trying to answer the question if this is worth doing at all.\n\n> I would also prefer a style that looked something like:\n> \n> fn f<Generic: AsRef<Concrete>>(arg: Generic) {\n>    _f(arg.as_ref())\n> }\n> \n> fn _f(arg: &Concrete) {\n>    // ...\n> }\n\nOk, I have no preferences here.\n",
