  "body": "Change ast::ty_param_bound so that all ty param bounds are represented\nas traits, with no special cases for Copy/Send/Owned/Const.\ntypeck::collect generates the special cases.\n\nA consequence of this is that code using the #[no_core] attribute\ncan't use the Copy kind/trait. Probably not a big deal?\n\nAs a side effect, any user-defined traits that happen to be called\nCopy, etc. in the same module override the built-in Copy trait.\nCloses #2284\n",
