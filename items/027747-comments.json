    "body": "@oconnor663 \n\nSo, the main problem with moving to inherent methods at this point is that the traits provide something akin to method overloading -- both apply to slice types varying only by some bounds (`Clone` and `Borrow`). I think originally they were less general, but there was some other holdup to making them inherent, which I no longer recall.\n\nre: `SliceExt`: the reason for that trait is somewhat obscure. Basically, the `std` crate ends up re-exporting a number of things from the `core` crate, but in the case of types like slices, it also wants to add methods of its own. We set things up so that the set of inherent methods for any type in `std` has to be defined in exactly one of the crates making up `std`. So `core`'s slices don't have any inherent items, because they're defined in `collections`. You can find the impl here: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/src/collections/slice.rs.html#160\n\nIf you're just using `std`, you never need to see/work with `SliceExt`. But if you're using `core`, the `SliceExt` trait is how we provide any methods on slices. It's in the core prelude, so you generally don't notice the difference.\n\n... Hope that helps!\n",

    "body": "@leodasvacas I think you mean multiple `impl Type {\u2026}` blocks, but that\u2019s not the main issue. We can add new methods in the existing impl blocks. However in this case, for example `<&[String]>::concat` and `<&[Vec<T>]>::concat` end up being the same method, so a helper trait would still be needed to generalize over both cases.\r\n\r\nThe libs team discussed this and consensus was to add `#[doc(hidden)]` to the deprecated (but stable) `connect` method, but make no further changes or stabilize anything at the moment. Inherent methods with a new helper trait doesn\u2019t seem much better than the current trait methods, and still wouldn\u2019t help with joining/concatenating iterators without first collecting into an intermediate `Vec`.\r\n\r\nDesign proposals to generalize this functionality to iterators are welcome.",
