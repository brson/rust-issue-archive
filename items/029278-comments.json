This is indeed breakage with the addition of `AsMut` for `Vec<T>`, but it is covered under our [API evolution policy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1105-api-evolution.md) which is to say that a local elaboration (e.g. type annotations) will fix this. If this becomes a widespread problem we will consider reverting, but for now it seems minor enough to not warrant that. \n",
