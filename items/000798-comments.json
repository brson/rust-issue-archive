    "body": "To be more specific, this is most likely because of an SELinux policy. Fedora just ships with SELinux and policies enabled by default if memory serves correctly. On a minimal (dev-tools only) 32-bit fedora installation, you can run the whole testsuite without issue.\n\nCuriously I couldn't find very exact reasoning as to why `librustrt.so` was compiled with an executable stack, but the other libraries weren't. It Just Is, and it's the only problematic file (`rustc`, `librustllvm.so` etc aren't affected.) Might be a fedora-specific thing?\n\nEither way I've fixed this in a branch with a linker flag. It doesn't seem to hurt anything. It'll need to be pulled and snapshots will need to be registered, so builds on SELinux-enabled machines can work out of the box.\n",
