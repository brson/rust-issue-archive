The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

Just to be sure, IPv6 is enabled for these new machines?\n\nAlso, as @Gankro pointed out although ccache may not be necessary to get us under the time limit it's certainly useful for reducing build times, so just curious if you guys know if it's an issue on the new machines? If not we can just turn it on and it'll all start working once it's smoothed out in the backend :)\n",

    "body": "Hey Alex,\n\nSadly IPv6 is out of our control when it comes to GCE as GCE is just not capable of that right now.\n\nWhat you could do though is use Docker inside of GCE and run your tests in there, thus giving you IPv6, and also allowing you to use the extra ram that the host has. This would also mean you could pre prep an image with any deps needed (like what is stored using ccache) to reduce test times.\n\nIf this is of interest, let me know how I can help.\n",
