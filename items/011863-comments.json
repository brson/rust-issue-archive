I'm still not thrilled with the design though because I now need to copy-paste multiple impls of `Hash` for each stream type. It seems like the only way to implement `Hash` once is to do:\n\n```\nimpl<S: Stream, H: StreamHasher<S>, T: StreamHash<S> Hash<S> for T { ... }\n```\n\nBut that prevents other types from implementing `Hash` because of #9075.

    "body": "@huonw: Sorry I had to run when I posted that last code, so I didn't really go into a good description. My realization was that `hash::Stream` can be used directly as a hasher as long as the method `hash` doesn't return a value. This lets me remove `H: StreamHasher<S>` from the typarams. \n\nRegarding `impl Hash<SuperAwesomeUintHasher> for uint`, yeah we wouldn't be able to write that. I suppose one option would be to support it is we could go back to more of a `Encodable`-esque approach that I had in an old [gist](https://gist.github.com/erickt/8562021#file-hash_encodable-rs-L71) of mine. Instead of having a `StreamHasher`, we could have:\n\n```\ntrait Hasher {\n    fn hash_u8(x: u8);\n    fn hash_u16(x: u16);\n    ...\n}\n\ntrait Hash<H: Hasher> {\n    fn hash(&self, &mut H);\n}\n```\n\nI had decided against that route because I thought the `StreamHash` was a bit simpler. I'll spend a couple minutes playing around with it to see if I can get it to work.\n\n@brson: I completely agree. I don't think this should be merged after we get a lot of input. I believe I have _a_ approach, but I'm not sure if it's the _right_ approach yet.\n",

    "body": "This is getting really close to my final design. It takes advantage of @eddyb's default type parameters in order to make the code compatible with the old Hash trait. I've also fleshed out the `StreamState` to include the ability for a `StreamState` to take care of converting a value into bytes. This allows it to overload how it'll hash primitive types like `u64` or a `&str`.\n\nThings left to do:\n- [x] Merge `hashmap.rs` and `hashmap2.rs`\n- [x] Merge `#[deriving(Hash, StreamHash)]` into `#[deriving(Hash)]`\n- [x] Change `#[deriving(Hash)]` to insert `#[allow(default_type_params)]`\n- [x] Improve the documentation.\n- [x] Migrate everything over to the new hash code, and remove the old one.\n- [x] Parameterize `HashMap` with the `Hasher`.\n- [ ] Get @cmr to benchmark the before/after of this PR.\n- [x] `#[deriving(Hash)]`'s `Hash` implementation should insert a `use std::hash::{HashState, StreamHash}` into the body.\n",

    "body": "@huonw: Yeah I'd love to cut down on the number of traits, but I'm not sure what's the best way to do it. I can think of two options:\n- End users almost never have to use a `Hasher`, that's only required by things like a `HashMap` in order to compute the hashes of multiple objects. So we could move it into a submodule and document it such that most users would ignore it unless they specifically wanted to make a `HashMap`-like thing.\n- Since the `Hasher` trait is really there just to make a hash state object, we could remove the `Hasher` and just make sure the hash state objects are clonable. Then `HashMap`-like things would be created with an initialized-but-never-used state object that is cloned in order to hash values. This does open the door to bugs where someone might forget to use `value.hash(hash_state.clone())`  though.\n\nUnless someone can think of other options, I'm leaning more towards the first one.\n",
