    "body": "@yuriks Ok, so what you're saying is interpret it as ISO-Latin-1, because that happens to be the first block of Unicode (codepoints 128-255), and then just throw an error for any characters that fall out of this range?\n\nAs for hex escapes, the lexer will see `\"foo\\xBE\"` and interpret the `\\xBE` while constructing the AST. The syntax extension will only see the already-parsed string. And for some reason Rust treats `\\x` escapes as if they were `\\u` escapes (but only reading 2 digits instead of 4), so this is equivalent to `\"foo\\u00BE\"`. Of course, if you're declaring that the string should be converted into ISO-Latin-1 before being turned into a fourcc, then that does effectively turn `\\xBE` back into the appropriate byte.\n",

    "body": "@kballard Yes, that's what I'm proposing. I don't really see it as an extra encoding/interpretation step, you're just casting the u32 characters to a u8 byte, erroring if they're out of range. This requires a very slight change in the interpretation to iterate over the string's characters instead of the bytes.\n\nI don't think this interpretation is particularly surprising and it adds flexibility to the macro.\n\nAnother thing occurred to me: I think the macro should default to big-endian regardless of the architcture's endianess. The u32 value should be the same for a given fourcc in any architecture. Where they differ is during serialization, which is already well handled elsewhere.\n",
