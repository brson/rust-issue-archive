    "body": "This looks good. The only change I'd like is for `cur_thread` to be initialized to 0 in `rust_scheduler`'s initialization list.\n\nAlso, I note that this will launch the first task on thread 1 instead of 0. Would make me happier if it started on 0, but not for any rational reason.\n\nThanks for fixing the indents. That was my mistake.\n",
