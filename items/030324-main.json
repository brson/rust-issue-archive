  "body": "r? @nrc \nSince PR #30294 unintentionally fixed issue #30159, it can cause breakage for a different reason than I originally stated in the PR (see #30159, I characterized the issue precisely there).\n\nThis commit limits the scope of the breakage to what I originally stated in the PR by \"unfixing\" the backwards incompatible part of #30159.\n\nI think fixing #30159 has enough potential for breakage to warrant a crater run. If you disagree, I can cancel this PR, leaving it fixed.\n",
