    "body": "@mahkoh you can't really compare to what other languages do because they all ignore the mode argument on windows (at least from what I've found). For example here's the source for [Go](http://golang.org/src/syscall/syscall_windows.go#L377) and [Python](https://github.com/python-git/python/blob/715a6e5035bb21ac49382772076ec4c630d6e960/Modules/posixmodule.c#L2446-L2462).\n\nI also encourage you to be a little more specific instead of saying that the structures are \"unusable right now\". When you say \"there is no way to cross-platform create files that are not-world-readable/writable or executable\" it's because there isn't one in the manner of permission bits on posix. I would also encourage you to explore the [`std::os::unix`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/) module to see that you can [set the mode on `Permissions`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/trait.PermissionsExt.html) and [on `OpenOptions`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/trait.OpenOptionsExt.html).\n\nI would certainly believe that we could add a few more unix-specific extension traits, but I would encourage you to be a little more constructive in what you're requesting.\n",
