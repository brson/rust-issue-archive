    "body": "I think this is a topic that needs to be approached carefully, since what types are actually `Sync` (resp. `Send`) can be very hard to reason about.  For example, I believe it is currently possible to write (correct) types in Rust that are `Sync` but not `Send` even when bounded by `'static`, which is not obvious currently from any of the documentation I've read.  Also, any complete discussion of `Send` must include `Rc` (which is neither `Sync` nor `Send` no matter what its lifetime) as well as more normal edge cases like `Cell` (`Send` but not `Sync`).  I think these edge cases are critical to understanding the types.  Some of the definitions and rules are also currently in flux (see the default / unsafe traits RFC, for example).\n",
