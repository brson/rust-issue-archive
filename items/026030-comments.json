    "body": "The compiler [does have support for the alternate filenames](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/19a39710c494d9300ffdc4e3f40dfda0ef62f7ba/src/librustc_back/archive.rs#L60-L62), so I'm curious what's going on here. Could you gist a full log of the compile so I can see the errors? Also, would it be possible to reduce this example any amount?\n\nFinally, modifications to files in `~/.cargo/registry` are not picked up by Cargo by default, so any changes you may have made may not have been registered and run in Cargo itself.\n",
