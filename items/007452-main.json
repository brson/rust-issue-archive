  "body": "Currently we pass all \"self\" arguments by reference, for the pointer\nvariants this means that we end up with double indirection which causes\na unnecessary performance hit.\n\nThe fix itself is pretty straight-forward and just means that \"self\"\nneeds to be handled like any other argument, except for by-value \"self\"\nwhich still needs to be passed by reference. This is because\nnon-pointer types can't just be stuffed into the environment slot which\nis used to pass \"self\".\n\nWhat made things tricky is that there was also a bug in the typechecker\nwhere the method map entries are created. For type impls, that stored\nthe base type instead of the actual self-type in the method map, e.g.\nFoo instead of &Foo for &self. That worked with pass-by-reference, but\nfails with pass-by-value which needs the real type.\n\nCode that makes use of methods seems to be about 10% faster with this\nchange. Also, build times are reduced by about 4%.\n\nFixes #4355, #4402, #5280, #4406 and #7285\n",
