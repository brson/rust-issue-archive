    "body": "I would be pretty happy about splitting transmute into a family of transmute-ish methods, just to make it more semantically useful. e.g. \"I just need to promote this lifetime\" or \"I want to re-interpret this pointer as something else, but preserve the lifetime\". Then when someone comes across it, it's easier to audit if that's (still) necessary, or if there's a better way.\n\nMaybe rename transmute to no_really_i_need_full_transmute :smiling_imp: \n\n(I just really hate transmute though)\n",

    "body": "Yes we have found historically that specialized transmute functions don't actually end up getting used often. Additionally it's fairly easy to specify either the first or second type parameter now that we have `_` inference, so this pain is somewhat alleviated when you manually annotate a transmute.\n\nDue to historical precedence, however, (we removed functions such as this awhile ago) I'm going to close this for now.
