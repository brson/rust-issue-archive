    "body": "Implicit coercion of `String` -> `&str` doesn't help the case of `&[&str]`, because you can't coerce a `&[String]` to `&[&str]`.\n\nThis particular case is one that doesn't matter too much for allocation reasons, because it's largely just done once, but I actually think that using `<T: Str>` to take slices of strings is what we should be moving towards.\n\n@alexcrichton A long time ago I had a PR to do something similar for `Process::new()` (and related methods), which ended up stalling out due to weird build issues on Windows. I ended up abandoning it because at that time I didn't have `try` access and it was too painful to try and figure out what was going on, but that PR was motivated by an issue explicitly requesting that behavior. Although in that case I believe it was taking whatever the predecessor to `StrAllocating` was (i.e. whatever had `.into_owned()` at that time).\n",

    "body": "Dealing with processes was a serious ergonomics issue because there were often many static strings that were used as arguments. That was an excellent impetus for the `Command` builder with a trait bound on the argument it takes.\n\nDealing with `getopts` where it gets its arguments 99% of the time from `os::args()` means that dealing with `&str` and `String` is much less of an ergonomics issue. It is also much rarer today to rely on implicit coercions now that `Vec` and `String` are ubiquitous and don't auto-borrow one way or the other.\n\nThe rationale for this PR, as stated in the description, is to save an allocation. This is a library which is never used in an inner loop, so I don't understand why saving an allocation should be a goal of this library.\n\nAs I stated before, the goal of rust is not to minimize allocations. If a library allocates, that does not mean that it is sub-par or needs improvement.\n",
