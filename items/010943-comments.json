    "body": "Thanks for working on this cleanup.\n\nThere's no specific reason for all the runtime functions returning weird combinations of pointer types, it's just the legacy of refactoring in various ways. Ideally, they all agree on the types and there are no casts.\n\nCString should probably keep using c_char.\n\nI think it's debatable whether the various logging and other runtime functions that deal in c strings should use *c_char or *u8 or some other typedef. This is all internal details so it doesn't matter too much. Ultimately we're probably going to want to be able to compile out `std::libc` in environments that don't have it, so the less we depend on it the better.\n",

    "body": "@brson no worries, I didn't have much time to work on this patch the last couple of days. Before this patch gets merged,  I'd like to clear up a few points:\n- at the moment I'm not really sure if I should use *u8 or *Void instead of *c_void. I'd like to keep my patch consistent with the other parts (in the existing source sometimes *Void is used and sometimes *u8).\n- I think I made good progress with pushing libc types down, expect for pipes and processes. The problem with pipes is, that they store 2 file descriptors internally and are used in combination with the pre defined fds in libc, like stdout. If file descriptors of pipes are stored as a Rust type, then comparing with this predefined fds would require more additional typecasts or file descriptors as a Rust type.\n",
