    "body": "Could you please elaborate?\n\nAs far as I can see RFC1156 changes default object bounds behavior for boxed trait objects. It doesn't affect references to trait objects. My case doesn't have any boxes and not even focused on references.\n\nThe issue is:\n1. Adding impl block implicitly put lifetime restrictions on objects. Trait impl block is the only impl block that does that.\n2. Apparently there is no reason to deal with lifetimes at this level. In most cases the whole impl block should be orthogonal to object's lifetime. Even if any restrictions are required, they can be applied to `self` in function definitions.\n\nAnother issue is that it's nearly impossible to find the source of the problem. Error message is non-descriptive. If this behavior is, in fact, intended one, then error message probably should state what caused static lifetime restriction.\n",
