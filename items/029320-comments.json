    "body": "It seems that `fcx.select_all_obligations_and_apply_defaults()` in `check_bare_fn` is causing the ICE. I was able to fix the issue by prepending `abort_if_errors()` before the call.\n\nBut if we do that, the maximum number of errors that can be emitted per iteration will be reduced. (If a function fails to type check, the remaining functions will not be checked at all.) Is this acceptable? Or should we find another solution? (Possibly by fixing the logic inside `select_obligations_where_possible`?)\n",
