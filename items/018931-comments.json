It's much better this way I think. :+1: \n\nI see some little points:\n- some char literals are only partially colored: in you example when you call `in_range('a', c, 'z')` only `'z` is colored, not the final `'`\n- in type parameters, `'a,N` is colored like a single token, while `'a, N` is not (in fact the `,` is still colored, while it should probably not)\n- It appears `Vec` is colored like builtin types (`uint`, `str`, ...) either it shouldn't, either this coloration should be given to other classic std types, like `Option`, `Result` and the associated `Some`, `None`, `Ok`, `Err`, don't you think ?\n",
