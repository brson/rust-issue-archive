    "body": "hi, wow, great work guys.\n\nI have to wonder if the ARM memory semantics are handled correctly in some of the concurrency libraries? namely, as i mentioned in #1858, the pipes send() implementation follows the classic \"fill a buffer, set a flag\" pattern, which needs some sort of barrier with noncoherent memory models. maybe this seems like a small nitpick next to the colossal size of the pull request, but i don't see libcore/pipes.rs among the files changed.\n",

Let me explain what I've done, because I've shuffled commits around, rebased, etc.\n\nFirst, I merged to incoming all the work on this branch that doesn't involve CMake, so that work has landed. Thanks! Note that I have not personally tested an ARM build yet, so it's possible that I broke things in the process.\n\nThen I rebased the remaining CMake bits into a single commit and pushed to my branch here: https://github.com/brson/rust/tree/cmake. I recommend rebasing your work off of that branch. We still haven't reached a conclusion about what to do about CMake, though my inclination is to keep it in tree since it's self-contained.\n\nFinally, since Android support is still immature and we can't officially support it yet, I did not want to put instructions in the README file. Instead I've started a wiki page: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-building-for-android.\n\nI'll leave this pull request open until we resolve the CMake issues.\n",
