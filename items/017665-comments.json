    "body": "I think a lot of systems (incl LLVM) call these options 'release' and 'debug' (not 'development').\n\nThe naming of the current `--debug` is misleading since it does not give you debuginfo.\n\nCan we fold the current `--debug` and `--disable-optimize` flag into one of these, or vice versa, or do we need all these things to be togglable independently (i.e. are 'release' and 'development' mode umbrella options that just turn on and off others)?\n\n`--release-channel` is a related flag that currently only controls the versioning and package naming. Is that going to tie into this or be independent?\n\nThe naming of `--release` and `--development` flags do not fit into the current scheme used by configure where everything is either `--enable-foo` or `--disable-foo`.\n\nUnder the current configure script how do you even turn on `-g`? I don't see it.\n\nEven if we turn off debug logging and asserts for release builds we should keep it on for snapshots. Let's please not land any changes here without updating the automation.\n",

    "body": "I would vote for this state of affairs:\n- These options can be disable/enabled via `configure`:\n  - `debug` - on == `--cfg ndebug`, off = `-g`, default on. This flag applies to bundled C libs as well\n  - `optimize` - on == `-O`, off == nothing, default on. This flag applies to bundled C libs as well.\n  - `parallel-codegen` - on == `-C codegen-units=4`, off == nothing, default on\n\nI believe that the vast majority of builders of rust will want a very fast build and will not be distributing the binaries. It's much easier to recommend that one package maintainer turns on one or two flags as opposed to recommending that all users who download rust pass some set of many flags.\n\nAdditionally, given the defaults above, our automation would do this:\n- nightlies/releases - `--disable-debug --disable-parallel-codegen`\n- snapshots - `--disable-parallel-codegen`\n\nThe idea here is that the output should be as fast as possible so parallel codegen is disabled. On nightlies/releases we can removing debuginfo/debug logging. Note that whatever flags we use on nightlies/releases are also the flags that we would recommend to packagers.\n\nI personally don't think that `--release` and `--develop` (to the configure script hypothetically) would be pulling their weight today, so I'm not sure if it's worth it to add them.\n\nIf we pursue this strategy, then the changes from today would be:\n- Add a `parallel-codegen` option.\n- Modify nightly builders to pass `--disable-debug`.\n",

You can't really expect packagers for countless distributions to know which non-standard flags they should pass. It doesn't matter if you document it somewhere obscure, they will use the defaults. There will also always be users building it for themselves, and you can't really expect them to know that they're going to get a poorly performing Rust by default.\n",

    "body": "@brson I'm not attached to names, I'd be happy with --debug or making debug the default and just add --release.\n\n--debug is a make flag not a configure one, right? I think this has to be a configure thing to get the right versions of jemalloc and llvm. I think we might want to toggle things independently (e.g., to debug an optimised build), I was envisioning these things being umbrella flags. Not sure how to pass -g from configure to make, by assume it can't be too hard to make a way.\n\nThere are a bunch of configure flags which are not --enable/--disable prefixed - libdir, llvm-root, etc. Although they do all take parameters and --release would not. --enable-release doesn't really make sense though, and --disable-debug is kind of wrong because it does more than just not emit debug info etc.\n\nAgree about the snapshots\n",
