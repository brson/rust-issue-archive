    "body": "I think that in terms of stabilizing the interface of `Rc` and `Arc` that this is not something that we're going to be willing to commit to. The fact that the two structures are laid out currently is an implementation detail which isn't necessarily something that we want to guarantee until the end of time into the future. Your specific use case of sending a unique `Rc` seems orthogonal to converting to and from `Arc`/`Rc` as the `is_unique` method could also be used for that purpose.\n\nFor now I'm going to close this PR on the grounds that stabilizing an interface such as this is an incredibly large commitment I don't think we're ready to make. If we get a large amount of demand for a feature such as this, however, we can certainly reconsider adding this in a backwards-compatible fashion.\n",
