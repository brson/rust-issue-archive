  "body": "This PR substantially narrows the notion of a \"runtime\" in Rust, and allows calling into Rust code directly without any setup or teardown. \n\nAfter this PR, the basic \"runtime support\" in Rust will consist of:\n- Unwinding and backtrace support\n- Stack guards\n\nOther support, such as helper threads for timers or the notion of a \"current thread\" are initialized automatically upon first use.\n\nWhen using Rust in an embedded context, it should now be possible to call a Rust function directly as a C function with absolutely no setup, though in that case panics will cause the process to abort. In this regard, the C/Rust interface will look much like the C/C++ interface.\n\nIn more detail, this PR:\n- Merges `librustrt` back into `std::rt`, undoing the facade. While doing so, it removes a substantial amount of redundant functionality (such as mutexes defined in the `rt` module). Code using `librustrt` can now call into `std::rt` to e.g. start executing Rust code with unwinding support.\n- Allows all runtime data to be initialized lazily, including the \"current thread\", the \"at_exit\" infrastructure, and the \"args\" storage.\n- Deprecates and largely removes `std::task` along with the widespread requirement that there be a \"current task\" for many APIs in `std`. The entire task infrastructure is replaced with `std::thread`, which provides a more standard API for manipulating and creating native OS threads. In particular, it's possible to join on a created thread, and to get a handle to the currently-running thread. In addition, threads are equipped with some basic blocking support in the form of `park`/`unpark` operations (following a tradition in some OSes as well as the JVM). See the `std::thread` documentation for more details.\n- Channels are refactored to use a new internal blocking infrastructure that itself sits on top of `park`/`unpark`.\n\nOne important change here is that a Rust program ends when its main thread does, following most threading models. On the other hand, threads will often be created with an RAII-style join handle that will re-institute blocking semantics naturally (and with finer control).\n\nThis is very much a:\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nCloses #18000\nr? @alexcrichton \n",
