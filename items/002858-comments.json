From (most of) the compiler's perspective a function marked with `#[test]` is just like a function marked with `#[cfg(test)]`, so we would likely want to solve this for general conditional compilation, not just tests.\n\nFunctions that don't get compiled get stripped from the AST very early on, so I guess we would need to generate another side table of items that were removed from the AST. Then resolve could peek into that table when it fails.\n",
