I'm thinking it will get split into `TyArray` and `TySlice` in a followup, so maybe just leave it for now?\n\nAs for getting rid of the `Ty` prefix, it might be possible to rename `TypeVariants` to something shorter like `TyV`, sprinkle some `use rustc::middle::ty::TyV` into other modules, and write `TyV::Int` instead of `ty::TyInt`.  Not sure if that's worthwhile.\n",
