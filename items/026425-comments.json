    "body": "The reference also doesn't say it shouldn't. This is expected behaviour as it allows this to be valid Rust code:\n\n``` rust\nlet x = match foo {\n    1 => do_1(),\n    2 => do_2(),\n    _ => return 0\n}\n```\n\nSince a semicolon here wouldn't be valid syntax. Note that the semicolon isn't part of the return expression at all, it is instead part of statement syntax.\n\nReferencing your comment in the linked issue, there are many constructs that you're unlikely to see in regular Rust code that are, nonetheless, valid. Take a look at [this test](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/weird-exprs.rs) for some crazy stuff that is perfectly valid Rust code.\n",
