    "body": "I do think that many of the `info!`s should be `error!`s or even `.span_bug`s. They represent implicit assumptions on the part of this code, that aren't necessarily true in general, so just \"ignoring\" them with `info!` means they just get swept under the carpet leaving people wondering why things aren't working.\n\nThe fact that using e.g. `.span_bug` causes compilation to fail seems ok to me: it's only causing compilation with an explicit `-Z save-analysis` flag to fail, and represents an invalid state in the DXR outputer anyway, i.e. the output would be bogus/incomplete. I guess a middle ground would be using `.span_err` or `.span_warn` so that the bugs are user-visible by default but the output still occurs. Yet another possibility would be using a macro that normally calls `.span_bug` but checks, say, an env var like `RUST_SAVE_ANALYSIS_IGNORE_BUGS` that downgrades the error messages to a weaker `.span_...` meaning you get as much of the output as possible.\n\nMaking sure it's user visible seems especially important since this code is relatively hard to test, so external changes can cause new \"error\" code paths to be hit without anyone realising. (Also, since it does so much manual span hacking, which are sensitive to grammar changes.)\n\n(Calling `.span_bug` is especially \"nice\" for the testing purpose, because it will cause any tests to actually properly fail if bugs are introduced to it & is clear to users that it's not meant to happen.)\n",

I guess that adds yet another dependency (dxr) to the whole process. :( ). Presumably that would be assisted by targets in the makefile too.
