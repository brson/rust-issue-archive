  "body": "These two commits are aimed at \"fixing\" our usage of `dllexport` in the compiler. Currently we blanket apply this attribute to _everything_ public in a crate, but this ends up with a few downsides:\n- Executables are larger than the should be as a result of thinking they should export everything\n- Native libraries aren't handled correctly because technically a statically included native library should be exported from a DLL in some cases.\n- Symbols don't actually need to be exported if they never end up in a DLL.\n\nThe first commit adds a new unstable attribute, `#[linked_from]`, which is a way to tell the compiler what native library a block of symbols comes from. This is used to inform the compiler what set of native libraries are statically included in the rlib (or other output). This information is later used to export them from a DLL if necessary. Currently this is only used in a few places (such as the LLVM bindings) to get the compiler to link correctly.\n\nThe second commit stops adding `dllexport` to all items in LLVM and instead explicitly telling the linker what symbols should be exported. We only need to do this when building a dynamic library, and otherwise we can avoid adding `dllexport` or telling the linker about exported symbols.\n\nAs a testament to this change, the size of \"Hello World\" on MSVC drops from 1.2MB to 67KB as a result of this patch. This is because the linker can much more aggressively remove unused code.\n\nThese commits do not yet attempt to fix our story with `dllimport`, and I'll leave that to a future PR and issue, for now though I'm going to say that this\n\nCloses #7196\n",
