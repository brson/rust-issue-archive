    "body": "@Diggsey, thanks for your continuing work and arguments on this topic. Since these APIs are pretty contentious, I think a decision is best made through the full RFC process -- both in terms of any new APIs, and also about whether to stabilize or remove the existing API. As such, I'm going to close out both this PR and the original one.\n\nTo try to keep the discussion in one place, it'd be better to have a single RFC that covers both alternatives. @alexcrichton plans to write an RFC in favor of the `Option`-producing version. @Diggsey, would you be willing to write up an \"Alternatives\" section for that RFC that summarizes your API and arguments in favor of it? @alexcrichton could then include it, credited to you. (We could also do it the other way around.)\n",
