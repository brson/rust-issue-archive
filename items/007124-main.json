  "body": "This removes all of the explicit `@mut` fields from `CrateContext`. There are still a few that are managed, but no longer do we have `@mut bool` in the structure.\n\nMost of the changes are changing `@CrateContext` to `@mut CrateContext`, though I did change as many as I could get away with to `&CrateContext` and `&mut CrateContext`. The biggest thing preventing me from changing to `&[mut]` in most places was the instruction counter thing. In two cases, where I got a static borrow error and a dynamic borrow error, I opted to remove the count call there as it was literally the only thing preventing me from switching to `&mut CrateContext` parameters in both cases.\n\nOther things to note:\n- the EncoderContext uses borrowed pointers with lifetimes, since it can, though that required me to work around the limitation of not being able to move a structure with borrowed pointers into a heap closure. I changed as much as I could to stack closures, but unfortunately I hit the AST visitor and changing that is somewhat outside the scope of this PR. Instead (and there is a comment to this effect) I choose to unsafely get the structure into the heap, this is because I know the lifetimes involved are safe, even though the compiler can't prove it.\n- Many of the changes are workarounds because of the borrow checker, either dynamically freezing it for too long, or inferring too large a scope. This is mostly just from nested function calls where each borrow is considered to last for the entire statement. Other cases are where `CrateContext` was borrowed in a `match` causing it to be borrowed for the entire length of the match, even though that wasn't wanted (or needed).\n- I haven't yet tested to see if this changes compilation times in any way. I doubt there will be much of an impact however, as the only major improvements are less indirection and fewer refcount bumps.\n- This lays the foundations to remove many more heap allocations in trans as many cases can be changed to use lifetimes instead.\n# \n\nThis change includes some other, minor refactorings, as I am planning a series, however I don't want to submit them all at once as it will be hell to continually rebase.\n",
