    "body": "The semantics that you are asking for I don't believe have ever existed. Am I correct in assuming that you want something like:\n\n``` rust\nenum TryValue<T> {\n    Empty,\n    Disconnected,\n    Data(T),\n}\n\nfn try_recv(&mut self) -> TryValue<T>;\n```\n\nWe have never had a method of attempting to receive a value and simultaneously knowing whether the channel is empty or disconnected. Your previous code is easily mappable to today's semantics, so I'm a little unsure on what you're attempting to do. Does the example I have capture what you'd like to learn from a call to `try_recv`?\n",
