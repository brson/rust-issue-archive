Could you add a test to make sure nothing too surprising happens?\n",

    "body": "The logs end with this:\n\n```\ntest task::task_abort_no_kill_runtime ... ok\n\ncommand timed out: 3600 seconds without output, attempting to kill\n```\n\ntask_abort_no_kill_runtime has a call to `timer::sleep(1000)` but that shouldn't go 3600 seconds and it looks like it completed okay anyway. The next output on my machine (also linux 64-bit) is a bunch of ignored tests before it moves on to test libgreen.\n\nBroken bot?\n",
