    "body": "@brson: as far as I can tell from a cursory search of functional languages that I know the name of, it seems nonexistant as a std adapter. But I'm not an expert on functional languages, and I find their docs to be fairly tedious to search. Although maybe this sort of thing is easier to implement in more functional languages? Or maybe they just don't care about things like random access, size, and bi-directionality, which is what makes it non-trivial.\n\nI don't have a lot to say about its usefulness that I haven't already. A couple people expressed a desire for it, and it's non-trivial for someone to implement a full version (not just a plain Iterator) correctly. I personally don't need it for anything, I wrote it because it seemed like an interesting learning project.\n\nPerhaps @sfackler or someone in [the thread](http://discuss.rust-lang.org/t/pseudo-rfc-interleave-iterator/249) can provide a more rigorous argument for its inclusion. \n\nHonestly, at this point my primary motivation to get it in is just to not have wasted the ever-patient and helpful @kballard's time. :D\n",
