    "body": "This is because c_double is a typedef for f64, and f64 and float are not type compatible (they used to be). Most of the float functions are just reexports of bindings to the C math libraries.\n\nThe easiest fix is to write wrapper functions in core::float that cast to the right type (will be a noop).\n\nBeyond that it might be nice to think about how to get rid of the duplication between float/f32/f64.\n",

I think this should be a\nseparate issue, however (one that probably wants removal of a number of\ntop-level functions in the numeric modules.\n\nI believe the preferred method is now `3.2f.round()`. This won't work for\nliterals (`3.2.round()` has multiple methods applicable in scope), but it would\nwork for any floating type which is inferred somewhere else (to be expected).\n\nI'm going to close this saying that it's been fixed, but if others feel\ndifferently I can definitely reopen.\n",
