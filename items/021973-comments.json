Can you find a real world example of this? To keep the performance the same, I could make hashmap use two allocations, `[VVVV\u2026hhhh\u2026]` and `[KKKK\u2026]`.\n\nHere's a relevant post on data layout: http://www.reedbeta.com/blog/2015/01/12/data-oriented-hash-table/\nUnfortunately, it's of little use for us, because it's not about Robin Hood (and for C++, not Rust).\n\nThis is how benchmark results have changed:\n\n```\n[40.573, 41.706, 209.1, 179.4, 122.8, 78.4, 182.7]\n  Cleanup.\n[41.989, 43.615, 212.4, 167.8, 125.0, 78.7, 163.3]\n  Changed HashMap's internal layout.\n[41.145, 42.298, 206.8, 162.5, 121.7, 78.9, 159.3]\n  In-place growth for HashMap.\n[41.055, 42.427, 208.3, 156.0, 124.2, 78.4, 161.6]\n```\n\n@pnkfelix: Lookup has become slower after the first commit because of refactoring. Keep in mind that the benchmark does 1000 lookups per iteration and the difference between 41.7ns and 42.4ns per lookup is small.\n\nThe improvement from in-place growth is suprisingly low. I'll have to check why.\n",

I used to be able to grok this code pretty ok: We have HashMap, RawTable, and some Buckets. Now everything's super generic over some \"M\" type and there's Partial\\* types all over.
