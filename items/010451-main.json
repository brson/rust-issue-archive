  "body": "I implemented BufWriter. I realize the use of conditions are on their way out for IO, but it does raise a condition if a write will not fit in the buffer for now.\n\nI also replaced the seek code for MemWriter. It was adding the offset as a uint, which is unsound for negative offsets. It only happened to work because unsigned addition performs the same operation with two's complement, and sizeof(uint) <= sizeof(i64) so there was no (lack of) sign extension. I replaced this with computing an offset as an i64 and clamping to zero. I don't expect anyone will have use BufWriter with a byte buffer greater than 2^63 bytes any time soon.\n\n@alexcrichton\n\nCloses #10433 \n",
