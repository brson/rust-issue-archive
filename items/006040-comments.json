    "body": "No, I don't think so. I'm sorry I didn't see this one earlier.  The answer is that quote_tokens is currently written in such a way that it \na) is cloaking(/unhygienic), and\nb) requires an in-scope variable named ext_cx\nThis is very nasty, in my opinion. It's probably worth opening an issue called \"rewrite quote_tokens (etc.) to not be so icky\". However, this is not a bug, per se.\nI'll open an issue on that, and close this one.\n",
