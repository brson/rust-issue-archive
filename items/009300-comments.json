If the goal of Rust is to create a safer language, I don't see why we'd want to avoid implementing security algorithms in that language and instead delegate them to more unsafe languages. However, since that is the decision, I don't think it makes any sense to implement a tiny subset of algorithms and ignore all the rest. I'll submit a patch to remove everything crypto related, but it might take me a few weeks to get together.\n",
