    "body": "@brson: yes, LLVM's understanding of `noalias` is that it's the only way to mutate the value inside the scope and borrow checking provides this guarantee\n\nYou're allowed to have other references to the memory before and after the function, and the function can create more references to the value from the pointer it's passed.\n\nTechnically, `&` pointers are close to being `noalias` because LLVM regards 2 pointers as non-aliasing if neither of them is ever used to write to the destination. However, the fact that we have objects that are mutable without a mutable reference rules that out for now.\n",
