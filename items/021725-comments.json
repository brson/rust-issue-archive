    "body": "I'll have to have a look at the code in the morning to be sure of what's going on. I think the problem though is that we do not coerce when searching for impls, the `==` means we have to find an implementation of `Eq` (or is it `PartialEq`?) with `Self` = `&[u8]` and a type param bound to `&[u8; 3]`, which I assume will not work. If that is the case, I'm not sure what we can do about it - I think doing coercions when doing trait matching is impractical, though I don't exactly recall why. I guess it could work if the RHS of `PartialEq` were an associated type, but I assume there are reasons we don't do that.\n\nOTOH, I could be wrong and we should coerce and this is a bug...\n",
