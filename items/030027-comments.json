For instance, a file with the appropriate idata section could be compiled with LLVM and linked with LLD without needing an additional runtime or libraries.\n- Second, without this, the `kind=\"dylib\"` hint is superfluous, since the behavior is identical to `kind=\"static\"`, at least when targeting Windows (I haven't tested how the behavior is when targeting Mac or Linux yet)\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton MinGW is first and foremost a set of header files and libraries mimicking those available in MSVC, starting with those import libraries. The rest of the toolchain is simply a port of the GCC toolchain. So, I can guarantee you that MinGW consumes import libraries, and is bundled with \"off-brand\" replicas of import libraries for common Microsoft DLLs. As far as I know, they should be cross-compatible/interchangeable with the Microsoft ones, although there's always a chance that tiny differences would cause incompatibilities if trying to mix-and-match. Avoiding that minefield is reason enough to avoid dependency on them entirely.\n\nLLD, at it's core, is just a linker, but it does successfully consume import libraries, as the changelog for it maintains up to date compatibility reports with import libraries. A recent patch (dated Jun 17), mentions a dependency on an MSVC tool (lib.exe) to produce import libraries. To my knowledge, LLD is not bundled with any import libraries, but can consume both those bundled with MSVC and MinGW. This does mean it still has an external dependency on one of those two.\n\nAs I've demonstrated above, import libraries can be created manually through LLVM, thereby eliminating dependency on any external toolchains.\n\nNote that this is not a \"linker thing\", but a \"compiler thing\": Most compilers output DLL imports simply as static imports, indistinguishable from dependencies on static libraries. True DLL imports require a matching idata section. The linker can link such an idata section into the program, without needing any special awareness of its contents. In particular, without the idata section, the compiler \"erases\" the data of which DLL any given import must come from. This information is stored in the idata section.\n",

    "body": "@retep998 I don't understand what you mean by \"runtime overhead\". It doesn't use LoadLibrary, if that's what you mean. The idata section is how all Windows programs must define their import tables. It's part of the PE format. Import libraries must use the same method (Although import libraries skip any inlining optimizations LLVM can offer for the import stubs)\n\nThe compiler doesn't need to look in the DLLs. The information provided in the `link` attribute and `extern` section is sufficient, as I've demonstrated above. Adding an extra attribute for the ordinal hint could also help, but is not necessary.\n\nFor not overloading the meaning, a possibility is to use a different type of `kind`, like `kind=dll`.\n",

    "body": "if I understand what this does correctly--removes the need to have the import library on Windows--I really want this.\nGetting users to have the import libraries in the right places is painful in basically any language.  Not to mention getting the users to have the right import libraries for the toolchain they're using, etc.  You can probably build a lot of stuff from source, but at least one of my projects requires CMake and 6 or so Python packages.  On top of that, it uses Libsndfile (can only be built under MinGW) but must itself be built under VS (because it's audio and it needs the Wasapi interfaces).  This setup is perhaps atypical, but it's all for very good reasons.  The net result is that getting it working with a build script is tricky, as is providing an import library to everyone who needs one.\nOr, if we had this, I could just not bother and keep giving out binary dlls all day long and everyone would be happy.  This would simplify my life greatly.\nIt might also help the Sdl2 bindings, which currently instruct you to copy a library to a MinGW directory and then to put a DLL in your cargo project.  Either those instructions or some other instructions elsewhere further specify that you have to be careful to not accidentally use the Visual Studio Sdl or it will all explode.\n",

    "body": "I'd much rather this used a new kind or new syntax rather than changing the behavior of `dylib`. One example of how changing the behavior of `dylib` could cause breakage is when linking to a DLL which only provides a function via an ordinal rather than a symbol name (yes this does happen quite often). The import library thus serves an important role in correlating the symbol name to the ordinal. Also since many people currently use `kind=dylib` to link to static libraries (since `kind=static` does undesirable bundling), making `dylib` do this instead of linking to an import library would cause those situations to break as well.\n",

    "body": "All an import library really is, is a mapping from a symbol such as `_foo@4` to a symbol in a dll such as `foo` in `BAR.dll`. A `.def` file is one way of explicitly specifying this mapping, and both `lib` and `dlltool` can create an import library from that `.def`. The only issue is that `lib` doesn't support mapping from one symbol name to a different symbol name, so on 32bit it _only_ supports cdecl `_foo` -> `foo`, which means it is completely unusable for stdcall.\n\nAnyway, to make rustc be able to emit this sort of information without losing out on anything, all the user needs to be able to do is specify these things:\n1. The DLL name. Can be specified via `#[link(name = \"foo\", kind = \"dll\")]` which ends up being `foo.dll`.\n2. The symbol name in the DLL. Defaults to the literal name of the function/static. The question here is for 32-bit, whether to link to the decorated version or the non-decorated version. By default a dll created without a `.def` will export decorated symbols, while a dll with a `.def` will export undecorated symbols, and the import library will provide the mapping from decorated to undecorated. I believe that the predominant use of this functionality will be to link to system libraries, which fall into the latter group, so I'd prefer the default to be undecorated, and if you use `#[link_name]` it will use the decorated form instead, unless you prefix it with `\\x01` in which case it will be undecorated again.\n3. The ordinal in the DLL. Some symbols are _only_ exported from the dll via ordinal, and not by name, so it is critical that there be a way to specify the ordinal. Some sort of `#[ordinal]` or `#[link_ordinal]` attribute would suffice.\n\nHave I missed anything? As far as I can tell this should be sufficient.\n",

    "body": "Interestingly, the `windows-gnu` toolchain can link DLLs directly, without the need for any import libraries. You can test this by renaming `libkernel32.a` in the `...lib\\rustlib\\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\\lib` subdirectory of your toolchain. You'll get a `ld: cannot find -lkernel32` error when linking. If you then copy `kernel32.dll` from `c:\\windows\\system32` to `lib` the build will work again. I've also tried linking other 3rd party DLLs and it works without any problem, the DLLs just have to be on the library search path for the linker.\r\n\r\nSo actually it seems Rust could theoretically just add `system32` to the library search path for all builds and dispose of all the Windows import libraries in the toolchain folder for `windows-gnu` targets.
