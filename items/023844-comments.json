    "body": "Thanks for the PR! In the past we've generally been pretty hesitant about adding inherent methods on smart pointers, however as they will shadow all other methods of the same name. In the past we've requested that extra functionality for smart pointers go as top-level functions as well.\n\nAlso, we do seem to definitely have a bit of a sprawling story for extra functionality on smart pointers, there's an interesting subset of functionality between [`std::rc`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/#functions) and [`std::arc`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/arc/#functions). I'm not sure what the best story is here for these functions, and we may want to hold off on landing new features until we've had time to reconsider the extra functionality. That being said though these are all unstable so I'm also ok landing in the interim (despite that they may change slightly).\n\ncc @aturon, do you have thoughts on adding apis such as this?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton thanks for the info!\n\nMay I wonder why top-level functions are preferred for smart pointers instead of the member functions?\n\nI'd be happy to use the existing functions without introducing more, but as I said there is no way to get the mutable contents at the moment without `Clone` bound, which I don't have.\n\nAs for the intersection, for [gfx-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs) we'll need some sort of abstraction over `Rc`/`Arc` in order to support single-threaded/multi-threaded resource management without extra overhead (https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/636). AFAIK, that does require HKT, but we can prepare for it now by introducing a common trait that both `Rc` and `Arc` implement.\n",

    "body": "> May I wonder why top-level functions are preferred for smart pointers instead of the member functions?\n\nRight now if a smart pointer `P` defines the method `foo`, then it is impossible to call the method `foo` on a type `T` if you say something like:\n\n``` rust\nlet ptr: P<T> = ...;\nptr.foo();\n```\n\nThis is because the receiver's methods trump the `Deref`'d type's methods, so `foo` will always be dispatched to `P` instead of `T`. This can be worked around with UFCS, however, so this isn't as pressing as it was before!\n",
