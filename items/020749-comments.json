    "body": "@rrichardson none of the proposed rules allow for that example that you just gave. The problem is that there are _no_ local types in the impl -- just `Box<PR>` and `Box<PB>`. Now, because `PR` and `PB` implement the `Processor` and `Publisher` traits, you could argue that they are local, but it's not really true. Those traits can be implemented for any types, and moreover could be implemented by downstream crates. @aturon and I went through a lot of examples like that and basically concluded that it's super hard to use traits to \"divvy up\" the impl space like that. It seems to create a hard requirement that for every impl we check every other existing impl for coherence violations, at minimum, which seems like a bad `O(n^2)` requirement to impose (though in practice it'd likely be optimizable in most common cases to not require a true `O(n^2)` check).\n",

    "body": "Another example. I wanted to write a Memory trait that supports reading and writing bytes:\n\n``` rust\npub trait Memory {\n    fn read_u8(&self, addr: u16) -> u8;\n    fn write_u8(&mut self, addr: u16, val: u8);\n}\n```\n\nThen I wanted to add convenience methods: everything that implements Memory should just get `Index<u16,Output=u8>` for free. This would allow writing `mem[0xff]` which would just call through to `read_u8`. But this code leads to said compile error:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::ops::Index;\nimpl<M: Memory> Index<u16> for M {\n    type Output = u8;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nIs that not possible? Or am I just doing it wrong?\n",
