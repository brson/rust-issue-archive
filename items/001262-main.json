  "body": "I was still having issues with the build system somehow getting confused\nas to which set of valgrind headers to use when compiling rt.\n\nThis commit moves all the valgrind headers into their own directory\nunder rt and makes the usage more consistent. The compiler is now passed\nthe -DNVALGRIND flag when valgrind is not installed, as opposed to\npassing -DHAVE_VALGRIND.\n\nWe also pass `-I src/rt` to the compiler when building rt so you can more\neasily import what you want. I also cleaned up some erroneous #includes\nalong the way.\n\nIt should be safe to always just import the local valgrind headers and use\nthem without question. NVALGRIND turns the operations to no-ops when it\nis active, and the build and tests run cleanly with or without.\n",
