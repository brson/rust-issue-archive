I notice that `stats.rs` now resides in libtest, but the domain-specific counter and timing support code in rustc is still disjointed.\n\nMaybe this is ok? Even with the current state of affairs, you could imagine someone building as a crate an application metrics library atop `test::stats`, integrating ideas from Dropwizard's Metrics, HdrHistogram, etc. Would this be undesirable? It's unclear whether that kind of full-featured metrics library was the intended outcome of this issue or rather a collection of traits and utilities with which to write one.\n",
