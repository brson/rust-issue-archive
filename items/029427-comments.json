    "body": "Usually taking a lock without using it is a bug.  (Intentionally poisoning a mutex that you're not otherwise using is sufficiently unusual that I think making people silence a lint is OK.)\n\nMost C++ compilers do this (it's kind of required because of how C++'s RAII guards are designed), and I find that it makes their unused variable warnings nearly useless because nothing that contains a heap allocation is ever considered dead.  With the exceptions of things like lock guards (which are handled differently in Rust), I can only think of two C++ classes I've encountered where running the destructor logically counted as a use (a profiler object that just recorded how long it existed and an object that `chdir()`ed on construction and then went back to the original directory on deletion (yay global state!)).  I'd consider having to mark those well worth it to get warnings about all the dead strings and vector-like objects.\n\nRelates to #21775 (where it sounds like the solution is likely going to be to just modify the warning text).\n",
