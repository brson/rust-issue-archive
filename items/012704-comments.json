    "body": "I think the question we should keep in mind is the following:\n\n_What **benefit** do we provide the user by forcing them to always deref pointers by hand?_\n\nNow think about that question for a minute. Give it some thought.\n\nI'm not saying there is no benefit, just that I don't see it. The way I see it, we require input (derefing by hand and matching only `&T` with `&T`, not `T`) but don't provide a corresponding return on that input (safety or whatever). This is in contrast to other Rust features that require work from the developer. The borrow checker is a good example: pleasing it is often annoying, but the return on the work is immense (safety from data races etc) and thus totally worth it.\n\nNote that we already auto-deref for method calls. From the tutorial:\n\n``` rust\nlet point = &~Point { x: 10.0, y: 20.0 };\nprintln!(\"{:f}\", point.x);\n```\n\nWe don't force the user to write `(*point).x` because that's annoying. \n\nI'm trying to point out that we've already decided to go down the auto-deref route at least in some places, but are holding back on doing it more widely for... I'm not entirely sure what reason. I'm afraid it has a lot to do with familiarity with C and C++ where one always has to deref pointers and we're just overly attached to that because of Stockholm syndrome.\n\nNote that C++ has references that are pointers that can never be null (so the same feature as pointers in Rust[1]) and they _are_ always dereferenced by default.\n\n[1]: Just not implemented as well. Setting a C++ reference to NULL is possible, but provokes undefined behavior so far less safe than the Rust equivalent.\n",
