    "body": "[My report](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/some-notes-on-reducing-monomorphizations/2459/13).\n\nAfter a few weeks of on-and-off work I could not find a simple heuristic that would produce reliable wins. Switching large amounts of functions from internal to some form of external linkage causes the compilation profile to change in large but subtle ways, and I couldn't find a scenario where the changes were consistently in favor of better compile times.\n\nI haven't given up hope though. I think this technique still has clear applications to profile-based (de)optimization and pre-instantiation of std library functions.\n\nI do think it's not worth keeping this open. If somebody has a breakthrough someday it'll happen. If not, nbd.\n",
