Whereas an arm of a match is a component of an expression.\n\nIt seems to me that if I can have an enum on a match arm, I should be able to have an enum on an expression itself (or maybe I should say on a statement). Right now we have the `cfg!()` macro to accomplish the same thing, although that unfortunately won't work for match arms.\n\nI guess I'm saying that I'm not opposed to this change, it just feels a little weird, and I'd be more comfortable if we went ahead and allowed `#[cfg(foo)]` on statements as well.\n",
