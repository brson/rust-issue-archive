    "body": "I am interested in improving the trace_macros output, but there is a strongly-worded note that `trace_macros` \"is a nasty hack that will certainly be removed.\" If it's going to be around for a while, though, I might take a crack at this.\n\nThe program:\n\n``` rust\n#![feature(trace_macros)]\n\nmacro_rules! double {\n    ($x:expr) => (2 * $x)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    trace_macros!(true);\n    println!(\"{}\", double!(21));\n}\n```\n\ncurrently outputs:\n\n```\nprintln! { \"{}\" , double ! ( 21 ) }\nprint! { concat ! ( \"{}\" , \"\\n\" ) , double ! ( 21 ) }\ndouble! { 21 }\n42\n```\n\nWhat is the desired output? I suspect it includes showing the span of the currently-expanding macro and then showing the expansion back in the original source location?\n",
