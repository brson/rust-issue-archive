    "body": "There could be some more uses for `lifetime`, though. In particular, I\u2019m thinking of an HKT-like extension to the language where traits can be for arbitrary kinds, including lifetimes. So something like the following could be valid:\n\n``` rust\ntrait NotStatic for lifetime {}\n\nimpl NotStatic for .. {}\nimpl !NotStatic for 'static {}\n```\n\nOr perhaps the kind signature for a type like `struct Foo<'a>` would be `type<lifetime>`. These all might seem to work fine with `lifetime` as a contextual keyword, but it falls apart when you allow things like user-defined kinds.\n\nI\u2019m honestly not super fussed about whether `lifetime` ends up as a normal keyword or not (most other uses of it would probably be 2.0.0+ features anyway), but I\u2019d certainly rather an explicit decision be made about it than a decision to make it a contextual keyword being implicitly made through indecision.\n",
