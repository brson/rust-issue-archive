    "body": "This is actually working as intended. For example, what does this function return?\n\n``` rust\nfn foo(bar: bool) -> int {\n    if bar {1} else {2} - 3\n}\n```\n\nIt actually causes a compilation error because the `if` structure is parsed as a _statement_, not an _expression_ (and the `if` expression doesn't have a `()` return type). This is done to allow `if` and `match` to be used in statement positions without semicolons at the end. \"Fixing this\" would likely cause many ambiguities arise and quite surprising behavior in other situations.\n\nI recall that at the [last work week](https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/Meeting-workweek-2014-03-03.md#semicolons-and-tail-exprs) we talked about this, but apparently didn't take very good notes. The conclusion, however, was that this was working as intended and the alternatives are too painful to stomach.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm going to close this as working-as-intended.\n",
