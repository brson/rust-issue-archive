  "body": "This attempts to bring our constructor naming in line with the conventions discussed on IRC and codified in the [style guide](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-style-guide).\n\nMost constructors are now just named after the type they construct. In some cases this involved tweaking the types a bit. For example the opaque task_builder type went from\n\n```\nenum task_builder = {\n    ...\n};\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nenum task_builder {\n    task_builder_({\n        ....\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOther functions were changed to use the `new_` prefix. No functions in core ended up named this way.\n\nThe `vec::init_*` functions are now `vec::from_*`.\n\nIn `std::map`, even though the hashmap constructor could have been named `hashmap`, I named it `new_hashmap` to be consistent with all the other convenience constructors in `map`.\n\nIt doesn't mess with the `io` module so as to not create too many conflicts for graydon's work.\n",
