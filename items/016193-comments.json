    "body": "`Vec` never had it, `Vec.get` was just the temporary name for what is now written as `x[i]` i.e. failing indexing. [`&[T]` still has it](http://doc.rust-lang.org/master/std/slice/trait.ImmutableVector.html#tymethod.get), and thus `Vec`, via the `as_slice()` proxy: `some_vec.as_slice().get(i)`. (This is all still a work in progress, and still waiting on some language changes like DST before we're really going to be able to consider it properly.)\n",
