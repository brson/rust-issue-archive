    "body": "Preliminary investigation suggests that yes, the issue is #3598. In this case, the old type checker was erroneously accepting the program. The reason is that `chain` winds up being invariant w/r/t `'b` because `Option` is invariant with respect to its type argument. I've often worked around this locally by not using `Option` and making a specialized type. Here is an example from the Rust code base:\n\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/resolve_lifetime.rs#L58\n\nThat said, I am hoping to open an RFC about support covariance soon. I want to do some local experiments, but I think the codebase is now at a point where it should be easy to introduce.\n",
