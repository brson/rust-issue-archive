    "body": "This is always going to be a by-value iterator. There really aren't that many consume iterators and the one I recently added to `SmallIntMap` takes `&mut self` instead of `self`. Vectors are a case where I think it makes more sense to take `self` instead of `&mut self` because you're actually moving out of the contents of the memory the vector owns. For a hashmap, it just owns the vector, and the vector then owns the actual data.\n\nPlus, sometimes it's kind of nice to keep the same hashmap around for multiple iterations of some code. Between iterations you consume all key/value pairs, but you don't have to re-allocate the entire map (and re-seed it from the task-local RNG).\n\nI'd still vote for taking `&mut self` instead of `self`, but others should probably weigh in other than me.\n\nAs a side note, I named the method `consume` on `SmallIntMap` because as soon as `advance` goes away I want it to look like:\n\n``` rust\nfor map.consume |(key, value)| {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nHaving the `_iter` prefix seems not necessary when there's no other `consume` method.\n",

    "body": "@blake2-ppc, I think there's a disconnect between what you and I are thinking, so here's what I thought the consume method could be like\n\n``` rust\nfn consume(&mut self) -> SomeIterator<(K, V)> {\n  let arr = util::replace(&mut self.slots, ~[]);\n  arr.consume_iter().filter_map(|x| match x { Some(slot) => Some((slot.key, slot.value)), None => None })\n}\n```\n\nThere's no constraints on what you're iterating over or anything like that. The only difference is that you can still use the hashmap after you consume it. The values owned by the hashmap are still moved into the iterator that you return.\n",
