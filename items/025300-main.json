  "body": "core::slice was originally written to tolerate overflow (notably, with\nslices of zero-sized elements), but it was never updated to use wrapping\narithmetic when overflow traps were added.\n\nAlso correctly handle the case of calling .nth() on an Iter with a\nzero-sized element type. The iterator was assuming that the pointer\nvalue of the returned reference was meaningful, but that's not true for\nzero-sized elements.\n\nFixes #25016.\n",
