In fixing the dependencies, now it's trying to build libsyntax for android which is almost certainly not what we want.\n\nThe relevant block [is here](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/mk/tests.mk#L282-L294) and I think that `rpass-full` needs the same treatment as `crates-exec` a little bit below it.\n",
