GCC may emit references to library symbols, that may not exist/be buggy in older versions of mingw.\nThis particular one probably happened because the developer had installed mingw with sjlj exception handling, which defines _Unwind_SjLj_Resume instead of _Unwind_Resume.\n",

I'm unclear on whether it also prevents people from linking to various windows system libraries (I have this vague idea that mingw includes artifacts that make the linker able to link to e.g. gdi32.dll). Is there any concern there?\n",

    "body": "gcc needs `lib###.a` to recognize system library (`###.dll`), so `make-win-dist.py` picks up [some of them](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/etc/make-win-dist.py#L45-L49).\nWe ship `libkernel32.a`, but we don't ship `libold32.a` or `libgdi32.a` so #17442, rust-lang/cargo#620, and #18617 occurs.\n\nSo, what's the role of bundle? I thought bundle is for providing \"minimal\" linking environment so that beginners can build hello-world without installing mingw-w64. In this scenario, if user want to do more than bundle can provide (e.g. gdi32), user must install mingw-w64. At least, this is current status.\n\nMaybe we can bundle [more system libs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/17442#issuecomment-56614334)? `x86_64-4.9.1-win32-seh-rt_v3-rev1/mingw64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib` is 72M.\n",

    "body": "@klutzy: on the other hand, there are a few libs that need to be matched to the version of gcc that Rust was built with.  It's mostly stuff like `crt2.o` and `libgcc.a`; possibly also `libmingw32.a`,`libmingwex.a`.  So simply deferring to external linker probably isn't a good idea, unless we ensure that our bundled libs are being found first.\n\n@brson: I kinda like the idea of shipping the minimal set of import libraries that is sufficient for linking Rust's standard library.  We could add a few more common ones like `gdi32`, but everything is a bit much, IMHO.\nFor reference,  here's the list of import libraries that D ships with: `ctl3d32.lib`, `odbc32.lib`, `ws2_32.lib`, `oleaut32.lib`, `comctl32.lib`, `advapi32.lib`,`gdi32.lib`, `shell32.lib`,`rpc4.lib`, `wsock32.lib`, `winmm.lib`, `comdlg32.lib`, `ole32.lib`, `uuid.lib`, `winspool.lib`, `user32.lib`, `kernel32.lib`.\n\nBtw, mingw `ld` can also link to dlls directly, so in many cases adding `-L %systemroot%\\system32` to the command line is enough.\n",
