It make it very difficult to pull out a few things and took considerable time to hunt down all the generated functions.\n\nIf anybody knows of a way to llvm-extract that will also pull out functions that the target depends on, that would be really helpful. -func=\"target\" will only give you exactly what you ask for. Running over the entire output just gives too much.\n\nSo, I've taken to putting a single function in main() and dumping that up then running opt with -print-before-all and looking at the before loop idiom recognition sections that are generated,\n",
