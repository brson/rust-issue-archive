I can see programmers using just \"var\" to be \"consistent\" or because \"var\" would be more powerful (don't have to change it if you decide to mutate later). Then you end up with less readable code overall.\n\nNot suggesting that Rust should be a serious bondage & discipline language, but a gentle nudge in the right direction is morally justifiable, I think (i.e. the rule would be \"for safe code, the safer constructs should be less noisy than the more powerful but easier-to-mess-up constructs\").\n",

    "body": "On one hand I like this, since it would remove the visual ambiguity from this form:\n\n```\nlet mut x = 4,\n    y = 8;  // is y mutable or not?\n```\n\nBut I'm inclined to side with ssylvan. Declaring mutables doesn't exactly need to be _ugly_, but I think it makes sense if they're ever-so-slightly less convenient to create than immutables, if only by a single keystroke. The activating keyword also needs to be distinctive, and (IMO) `var` is too widely used as a generic variable declaration keyword to specifically convey mutability in a language that prides itself on immutability-by-default. And think of the poor C# programmers, for whom `var` is our `let`!\n\nI still like the idea of replacing `let mut` with a single keyword, so as to address the code snippet above, but is there any reason for introducing a new keyword when `mut` itself would suffice, as per the original proposal in #1273?\n",

The way it works now I tend to declare everything as immutable, then the compiler reminds me it should be mutable, then I type `mut`. This is arguably good behavior that you would be less inclined to with a `var/let` split - typing `var` and `let` are equally difficult but you can't even type `let mut` without typing `let`.\n\nBut I don't h ave a preference and I do appreciate when I can compose functions entirely of statements beginning with three-character keywords.\n",

Subtly changing the assignment rules based on type smells funny to me.\n\nI'm inclined to agree with @pcwalton that we shouldn't penalize programmers from using a mutable binding if that's what they want. As for the concern about people unnecessarily using `var`, we could add an optional warning that complains if a `var` binding is singly-assigned. But I also think that we can set precedents for good style in rustc and the standard library.\n\nDave\n",

    "body": "IMHO good syntax design is not just about making \"everything\" you might ever want to do convenient, it's about gently nudging people on to the \"smooth path\" of the language's semantics and design goals.\n\nFor example, you probably wouldn't add special syntactic support for linked lists in Rust (a la Haskell), because one of Rust's foundational principles is to be efficient, and pervasive use of linked lists will work contrary to that principle. For the same reason sharing mutable data between threads probably shouldn't be too convenient (since safe concurrency is another principle), nor should it be super convenient to cast an arbitrary int to a pointer (since memory safety is a big principle). \n\nNot to say that it should be impossible to do any of these things, mind, just proportionately inconvenient so that it's clear from the syntax which is the idiomatic way to write Rust.\n\nMutable (local) variables aren't nearly as bad as any of these, but if Rust is indeed favouring immutable data for correctness and maintenance reasons (something I personally agree with), then the syntax should ideally give a gentle nudge in that direction. Even a single extra character or an extra modifier sigil or whatever would be enough to make it clear that \"let\" is less complicated than \"let mut\" or \"let!\" or whatever, and therefore must be the preferred default you should try to go for when you don't actually need the variable to be mutable.\n",

    "body": "@ssylvan Oh, I understand that point, it's just a question of degree, and the balance of trade-offs. We already promote immutability of data structures, and IMO immutable locals are less important to promote than immutable fields. (Especially since, IINM, we don't allow mutable locals to escape in heap closures.) And the loss of the ability to refactor between `let` and `var` without changing column count outweighs the benefit of promoting immutable locals. Hard to quantify, so I guess it's just my feeling.\n\nDave\n",

    "body": "@graydon  is correct that there were two original motivations.  However only one is still relevant.  The two motivations were\n- implicit \"by-copy\" capture of mutable variables in an `fn@`\n- understanding what data is mutable and what is not for borrowck\n\nIt turns out that the latter is no longer relevant.  The use of mutable/immutable variables was too crude in practice so borrowck has the idea of borrowing a variable \"temporarily\"---a mutable variable can be borrowed with an immutable ptr so long as the variable is not modified while the pointer is in scope.\n\nWe could perhaps just remove the idea of mutable/immutable locals and go back to the old rule---everything is mutable.  We could then issue warnings when a variable that is implicitly copied into a closure is modified after the closure is created. \n",

    "body": "There's a third motivation: immutable variables are easier to reason about. If everything is mutable you have to scan around the whole function to see what values a variable might have during its life time. Every variable potentially has complicated data flow (esp. with loops, branches, mutable function parameters, etc.) and it's hard to see what's going on without carefully analyzing every statement. If you have only one or two mutables in a function it sort of acts to \"flag\" them so that you're more careful when reading code involving hem.\n",
