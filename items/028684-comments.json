    "body": "Hmm...it might be related me having a pretty decent idea of how things work and so I generally skim the page looking for examples similar to what I'm looking for rather than read it in it's entirety as I might when I first started learning rust.\n\nI suppose what I would do is add a code example to [mut](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/mutability.html) with a definition of a struct with a mutable reference with 2 functions, somewhat like this (probably with some extra text around it):\n\n``` rust\n#[derive(Debug)] struct RefMut<'a>(&'a mut i32);\n#[derive(Debug)] struct RefImmut<'a>(&'a i32);\n\nlet ref_mut = RefMut(&mut 9);\nlet ref_immut = RefImmut(&9);\n\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", ref_mut);\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", ref_immut);\n```\n\nAdmittedly, this is a pretty weak example but I do think it shows a few things which the page doesn't have yet which are valuable:\n- `&mut` is able to be used in a type definition (not strictly as an operator)\n- `&mut` in a function definition matches the type definition and isn't just some slight of hand around a `&`.\n- It's easy to find via skimming and searching\n- The types `&` and `&mut` are able to be contrasted directly\n- You could use `let x: &mut i32 = &9;` alternatively but I think actually defining a type is slight more effective\n\n---\n\nIf you like the idea but think it needs more work, I can try to mock it up further later if that helps.\n",
