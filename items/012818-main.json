  "body": "This commit fixes a small bug in the green scheduler where a scheduler task\ncalling `maybe_yield` would trip the assertion that `self.yield_check_count > 0`\n\nThis behavior was seen when a scheduler task was scheduled many times\nsuccessively, sending messages in a loop (via the channel `send` method), which\nin turn invokes `maybe_yield`. Yielding on a sched task doesn't make sense\nbecause as soon as it's done it will implicitly do a yield, and for this reason\nthe yield check is just skipped if it's a sched task.\n\nI am unable to create a reliable test for this behavior, as there's no direct\nway to have control over the scheduler tasks.\n\ncc #12666, I discovered this when investigating that issue\n",
