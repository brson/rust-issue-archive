    "body": "@sstewartgallus what is a single case enum?\n\nTuple structs are like `struct Foo(uint, int, Bar)`. They actually do share a lot of the enum code though (which is why I'm looking into them: the IR they generate is awful).\n\nI agree that adding a keyword is bad but there are no suitable ones already in the grammar... and the current situation is pretty inexplicable.\n\nMost of the badness comes from abusing the term `struct`. A tuple struct is not a struct like any C/C++ programmer would expect.\n\nMaybe it's just something we'll have to live with, though.\n",

    "body": "I might be the only one, but I really like the current system, and can't think of any way I would improve on it. Data can use either named syntax (record-like) or unnamed syntax (tuple-like). Structs are single-variant, enums can have multiple. Built-in tuples use the unnamed syntax and also leave off the type name. Structs using tuple-like syntax with a single field just happen to be perfect for the `newtype` use case (see below). It's nice all around.\n\n(One way you could simplify it is by collapsing `struct` and `enum`, but C/C++ programmers wouldn't like that, and even as just syntax sugar `struct Foo { ... }` instead of `enum Foo { Foo { ... } }` is nice.)\n\nAll of that said, as the way to talk about them I'm not attached to \"tuple struct\" even a little bit, and \"named tuple\" doesn't sound any worse.\n\n> Only reason is because you can't have impls or traits on typedefs. If you could, this feature could be reduced to type Foo = (....), which would be ideal I think.\n\nThe point isn't to give it a new name, it's to give it a new type, so that the compiler yells at you if you mix them up. `struct Foo(Bar)` as a lightweight syntax for doing that is as good as any I've seen.\n",
