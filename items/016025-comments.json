    "body": "> Where do we do the stripping of that stuff now?\n\nI think it's the collapse/unindent doc pass in `src/librustdoc/passes.rs`\n\nI imagine that most use cases don't want the attributes of a field on the `ty::field_ty`, and this may have the possibility of impacting performance of the rest of the compiler. Would it be possible for these to be serialized, but off to the side? Rustdoc could then ask for them specifically via `load_attrs`\n",
