  "body": "The old Once.doit() was overly strict and used read-modify-writes when\nit didn't have to. The new algorithm will be just a read-acquire load in\nthe already-initialized case, and the first-call and contested cases use\nless strict memory orderings than the old algorithm's SeqCst.\n\nOn my machine (3.4GHz Intel Core i7) I was seeing the old algorithm take\n13ns (in the already-initialized case). The new one takes only 3ns, and\nthat drops to 0.5ns with the #[inline] annotation. I am unsure how to\nproperly measure the contested case, because of the very nature of this\nobject.\n\nThis algorithm definitely needs to be carefully reviewed by someone with\nmore experience using atomics.\n",
