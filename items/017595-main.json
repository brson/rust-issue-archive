  "body": "Currently `Decoder` implementations are not provided the tuple arity as\na parameter to `read_tuple`. This forces all encoder/decoder combos to\nserialize the arity along with the elements. Tuple-arity is always known\nstatically at the decode site, because it is part of the type of the\ntuple, so it could instead be provided as an argument to `read_tuple`,\nas it is to `read_struct`.\n\nThe upside to this is that serialized tuples could become smaller in\nencoder/decoder implementations which choose not to serialize type\n(arity) information. For example, @TyOverby's\n[binary-encode](https://github.com/TyOverby/binary-encode) format is\ncurrently forced to serialize the tuple-arity along with every tuple,\ndespite the information being statically known at the decode site.\n\nA downside to this change is that the tuple-arity of serialized tuples\ncan no longer be automatically checked during deserialization. However,\nfor formats which do serialize the tuple-arity, either explicitly (rbml)\nor implicitly (json), this check can be added to the `read_tuple` method.\n\nThe signature of `Deserialize::read_tuple` and\n`Deserialize::read_tuple_struct` are changed, and thus binary\nbackwards-compatibility is broken. This change does _not_ force\nserialization formats to change, and thus does not break decoding values\nserialized prior to this change.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
