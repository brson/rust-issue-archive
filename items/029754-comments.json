Supposing that we did switch to 1-3, and that an attack on 1-3 was later discovered, we'd want to reserve the right to bump it back up to 2-4 (or, you know, whatever the state of the art is by then) without risking massive breakage in the ecosystem. If changing the default hash function should prove to be disruptive at the current point in time then that's a separate problem that we need to consider, hence why I'm curious as to the true magnitude of such a change.\n\nFurthermore, I get the impression that the breakage that Gankro's envisioning wouldn't be detectable by Crater.\n",

The short data case remains a problem, due to (I think):\n- Lack of one-shot hashing, means the code visits branches to read and or update the partially written tail\n- Strings and slices write both data and length / delimiter, which is slow since it enters SipHash::write twice, hitting the code in the first point.\n\nOf course we should still go for it, if possible, but I don't think it's a substitute for allowing faster alternatives to be used (application may choose to sacrifice hash flooding defence, deciding it's not useful for them).\n",

    "body": "I still don't get the rationale behind choosing such a slow hash function. Recently, I have been working on a ZFS implementation for Redox. By replacing the default hash function (SipHasher) with DJB2, I got a ~1.5-2 speed-up of the directory map.\n\nIf you need a secure hash function, you should replace your hash function. Default should reflect the majority of usecases, not some edge cases. Furthermore, the rounds of SipHasher Rust is using can hardly be called \"secure\".\n\nDon't pay for what you don't use is C and C++ biggest advantage.\n",

    "body": "> The point is, you do, in the vast majority of cases, not need a secure hash function\n\nTo the contrary, attacker-controlled data can wind up quite deep in your program, and any time that may happen you're better off with a hash function that mitigates hashDoS.\n\nFrom a \"better safe than sorry\" perspective, the cases where you can get away with a non-cryptographic hash function should be ones where you can definitively say \"There is no way the keys I'm hashing could possibly be attacker-controlled\"\n\nI think this nicely aligns with both Rust's goals of safety and one of the primary use cases being Servo, a browser rendering engine which by necessity processes a great deal of potentially attacker-controlled data. The best choice, in my opinion, is to have a secure-by-default `HashMap` and provide an \"unsafe\" alternative for those who know they aren't hashing attacker controlled data and would prefer better performance.\n\n> and when you do, SipHasher is not sufficient.\n\nSipHash is among the few functions that _is_ generally considered sufficient to mitigate this case. For comparison, your recommendation of MurmurHash is widely known to be broken.\n",

    "body": "@Ticki I'd like to argue your point from another angle: If you have a slow-ish but secure hash by default, you only need a profiler to find out those usages that are your bottleneck and optimize those (perhaps even by just using fewer hash lookups, or parallelizing the hash computations and computing hashes up-front, ...). There are always multiple ways to do this, but measuring performance is the comparatively easy first step. Once you're done, your code runs reasonably fast and is mostly secure.\n\nOn the other hand, let's say we have a blazingly fast but somewhat insecure hash function. Your program will run faster by default, :star2: :cake: :100:! However, it will unexpectedly run _much_ slower on some workloads (either the :star: stars aligned :moon: so that you get a pathological-case workload or some clever colleague has studied his hash books and found you one) \u2013 to the point of grinding to a halt :hand: and eating your CPUs like it's going out of style. Debugging these problems is much harder than just running a profiler, and even with the aforementioned colleague, you're likely to miss some instance of the problem.\n\nThat's why having a secure hash function by default makes sense, even if it's slower for most workloads.\n",

    "body": "@llogiq \n\n> I disagree with @gnzlbg, the default function should be as fast as possible while still being reasonably secure.\n\nI think we agree then. In case it wasn't clear from my previous comment I said that the_default_ should be \"reasonably fast and reasonably secure\" as opposed to just \"as fast as possible (without being reasonably secure)\". With \"reasonably fast\" I was talking in absolute terms, e.g., as compared to an insecure hash function. I guess you expressed it better, we \"just\" need a very fast implementation of a reasonably secure hash function.\n\n> Data point: The benchmarks game rules were recently changed to require using the default hash table. It is conceivable they'll ask us to use the default hasher in the future, too.\n\nIn a real application where the hasher is a hotspot the programmer maybe will, after profiling, decide to use a non-default hash (a `std::` provided one or write their own). While I think that default performance is important, I don't think we should be making language decisions based on what a particular micro-benchmark website thinks about how micro-benchmarks should be written. If they are willing to publish apples with bananas comparisons as valuable data (e.g. some languages very secure hasher vs some other languages insecure hasher) I wouldn't take them very seriously. While it would be nice that Rust fares well there by default, micro-benchmarks show only one side of the story, we should weight them appropriately.\n",

    "body": "> Remember, it can always be upgraded without breakage.\n\n@funny-falcon argues that it should be resistant to Hash Flood Attacks. If we guarantee this as part of the function API we cannot upgrade it at will later (only to another hasher that maintains this guarantee), and if we don't, users cannot rely on this either. Arguably users that want to rely on this care enough to be choosing a particular hasher manually, so I think I would be against explicitly stating any guarantees in the API of the default hasher to be able to move freely in the future to a different hasher.\n",
