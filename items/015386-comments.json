The parser could check after parsing `box(EXPR)` that there is an expression following it, and if there isn\u2019t, parse it as `box() (EXPR)`. The only ambiguity I can think of is with boxed blocks in `if`s, `while`s, and `for`s, which could just be parsed greedily:\n\n``` rust\nif box(foo) {\n    ...\n}\n{\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nwould be parsed as\n\n``` rust\nif (box(foo) { ... }) {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nas it is today.\n\nI made a small patch to `syntax` that does this, and it works fine. I\u2019ll open up a pull request if this behaviour is desirable.\n",
