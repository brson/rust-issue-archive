  "body": "Closes #15525\n\nThe important bit of this are the changes from line 445 in mem_categorization.rs. Most of the other changes are about adding an Implicit PointerKind, and this is only necessary for getting a decent error message :-s An alternative would have been to add an implciti/explicit flag to cat_deref, which could be mostly ignored and so would mean much fewer changes. However, the implicit state would only be valid if the PointerKind was BorrowedPtr, so it felt like it ought to be another kind of PointerKind. I still don't know which is the better design.\n",
