    "body": "Oh I agree that having an auto-deref format is very useful, and that's what I would use most of the time, too.  But do you think people would find it surprising as the _default_?  Imagine the C programmer who writes `printf(\"%p\\n\", &x);` and gets `5`; is s/he going to think, \"Oh, how nice, printf is dereferencing things for me;\" or \"WTF?!?\"  The problem is more serious when you are printing (pointers to) large integers that are indistinguishable from addresses.  I can see some serious hair-tearing as a result.  I would expect a systems programming language to do what I say, and not second-guess me.\n\n> 99%+ of the time when I'm working with a &-reference, I care about the thing it's pointing to\n\nThen 99%+ of the time you aren't going to get what you care about with double indirection:\n\n```\nlet x = 5i;\nlet p = &x;\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{}\", &p), format!(\"{:p}\", &p));\n```\n\n```\ntask '<main>' failed at 'assertion failed: `(left == right) && (right == left)` (left: `5`, right: `0x7fff65681958`)', fmt_deref.rs:4\n```\n\nRegardless of where you fall on the preceeding, do you really want it to be _recursive_?
