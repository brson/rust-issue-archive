    "body": "This goes beyond syntax translation as it involves trans. Likely this needs a way to put extra information in the ast during parsing for later use by trans.  Since there is no any type currently the only way to do this in a generic fashion would be for syntax plugins to maintain their own state that maps ast node ids to whatever they need to store (i.e. asm code in strings), with any there could be an astTransExtensionNode({extName: str, payload: any}) that would be picked up by trans later on.\n",
