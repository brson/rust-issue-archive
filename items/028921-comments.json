Besides, the lint can give platform-dependent warnings (this is solved by `cast()` in the RFC linked above).\n",

I've been using my own `From` trait that does this + checked casts (return `Option`), but it would be nice to be able drop that dependency when I only need lossless int casts.\n\n> this screams for a lint...\n\nI treat `as` the same as `unsafe` (i.e. must be audited) and try to minimize its use in my code; instead, I use lossless/checked `usize::from`s wherever possible. And, I usually do this by grepping my code for the `as` keyword because I'm too lazy to (learn how to) write a lint. So, I would very much welcome such a lint. (Then I can copy it and modify it for my needs :smiling_imp:)\n",

    "body": "The libs team talked about this today and our conclusion was that at this time we'd like to avoid any `#[cfg]` impl blocks entirely. Along those lines we also think that implementations for `isize` and `usize` should be avoided at this time. We can always add them later, but it's less obvious that we want to add them right now.\n\nIt sounded like one of the main use cases of `From` and `Into` with `usize`/`isize` were around indexing, but @sfackler brought up a good point where we could certainly implement `Index<u64>` for vectors and slices today, it's just have extra checks on 32-bit platforms to test if it's out of bounds.\n\n@petrochenkov could you perhaps elaborate a bit on the use cases you're thinking of for `isize` and `usize`? Perhaps they can fit into patterns like `Index` above with slices?\n",
