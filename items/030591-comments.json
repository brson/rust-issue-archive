What prompted it for me is looking at http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/time/ , where only the first paragraph of the doc of each item is shown. `Instant` and `SystemTime` seem similar yet there must be a reason they\u2019re not the same. _I_ know the difference and the reasons because I\u2019ve read the relevant RFC, but no every reader of this page will have.\n\nFrom these first paragraphs, I read that `Instant` is monotonically increasing, and `SystemTime` is for filesystem timestamps. While correct, I think some important points are missing here.\n\n`Instant` being opaque is most important, but even the implications of that should be spelled out: it can not be in \"persistent\" storage or sent to a \"remote\" system. (I\u2019m being deliberately hand-wavy about what that means exactly.) Comparing it to another instant to get a duration (or adding/substracting a duration to get another instant) is the only thing that can be done with it.\n\n(Unless someone is tempted to parse `format!(\"{:?}\", instant)`, which maybe should be opaque as well?)\n\nThis means that `SystemTime` is probably the one to use for _everything else_. This is much more than timestamps in `std::fs::Metadata`.\n",
