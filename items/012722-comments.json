    "body": "Closing in favor of #10296. It looks like `self.state` is a trait object of the `GameState` trait. By default `~TraitObject` is equivalent to `~TraitObject: Send` which means that the underlying type must also be `Send`. You can modify the first function to `T: GameState + Send` to get the first function to compile, but it's very similar to the second function anyway.\n",
