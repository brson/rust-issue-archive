    "body": "This is much worse than this description makes it sound.  If I'm reading the code correctly, what's actually happening here is that `expr_x += expr_y` results in `expr_x` being trans'd twice (e.g., `foo().x += 3` would call `foo()` twice) if `+` is overloaded.  The proper fix is to refactor the `impl::trans_method_callee` callee function to take a pre-evaluated self expression, I think, or perhaps have it be a shallow wrapper around a function which does.\n",
