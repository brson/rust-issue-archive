  "body": "This patch transforms functions of the form\n\n```\nfn f<Generic: AsRef<Concrete>>(arg: Generic) {\n    let arg: &Concrete = arg.as_ref();\n    // Code using arg\n}\n```\n\nto the next form:\n\n```\n#[inline]\nfn f<Generic: AsRef<Concrete>>(arg: Generic) {\n    fn f_inner(arg: &Concrete) {\n        // Code using arg\n    }\n\n    f_inner(arg.as_ref());\n}\n```\n\nTherefore, most of the code is concrete and not duplicated during monomorphisation (unless inlined)\nand only the tiny bit of conversion code is duplicated. This method was mentioned by @aturon in the\nConversion Traits RFC (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blame/master/text/0529-conversion-traits.md#L249) and similar techniques are not uncommon in C++ template libraries.\n\nThis patch goes to the extremes and applies the transformation even to smaller functions<sup>1</sup>\nfor purity of the experiment. _Some of them can be rolled back_ if considered too ridiculous.\n\n<sup>1</sup> However who knows how small are these functions are after inlining and everything.\n\nThe functions in question are mostly `fs`/`os` functions and not used especially often with variety\nof argument types, so the code size reduction is rather small (but consistent). Here are the sizes\nof stage2 artifacts before and after the patch:\nhttps://gist.github.com/petrochenkov/e76a6b280f382da13c5d\nhttps://gist.github.com/petrochenkov/6cc28727d5256dbdfed0\n\nNote:\nAll the `inner` functions are concrete and unavailable for cross-crate inlining, some of them may\nneed `#[inline]` annotations in the future.\n\nr? @aturon\n",
