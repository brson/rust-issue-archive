    "body": "This seems like a good compromise between the competing interests to me. Some thoughts:\n- This takes an already wordy \"read lines from stdin\" example and makes it wordier with an extra import and method call. I'm beginning to think we should have `io::stdin()` and `io::stdin_raw()` where the first is a buffered reader by default (not relevant to this PR, just thinking out loud)\n- It seems unfortunate to require `IoResultIterator` being imported. I don't think a trait like that quite belongs in the prelude as well. Is there a reason you didn't use methods? It wouldn't be implemented generically for all iterators, but the constructor could work generically for all iterators (you'd just have to remember to call it).\n- `fail_on_error` seems a little wordy, perhaps a better name can work?\n\nAll-in-all, I'd like to reduce your example down to:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::io;\n\nfn main() {\n    for line in io::stdin().lines().fail_on_error() {\n        println!(\"{}\", line);\n    }\n}\n```\n",

    "body": "Rebased against master, passes make check. I'd mostly left this PR alone since I opened it in response to a mailing list / Issue discussion and I was waiting to see if that discussion was going to reach some sort of consensus. I haven't seen any further developments in that conversation, however.\n\nI've made a few changes:\n- I renamed the extension trait once again. Now its called `IteratorExtensions`.\n- I updated the `Bytes` iterator to also return `IoResults` instead of ignoring errors\n- I don't know if anyone was depending upon the previous behavior of ignoring errors. In case they were, I created another extension trait, `result::IteratorExtensions`, that adds the method `stop_on_error()` for any Iterator over Results that simply ceases iteration on the first error as opposed to calling fail!(). This is exactly what the `Lines`, `Chars`, and `Bytes` iterators currently do.\n\nWith the change to make stdin() buffered and with these changes, the example program that was being discussed now looks like this:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::io;\nuse std::io::util::IteratorExtensions;\n\nfn main() {\n    for line in io::stdin().lines().fail_on_error() {\n        print!(\"received: {}\", line);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo, as it currently stands, it still requires the extra `use` statement. The wordiness of this is unfortunate, however, it does mean that it works on all iterators over IoResults. Currently there are only 3 direct iterators over `IoResults` - `Lines`, `Chars`, and `Bytes`. However, those aren't really the only iterators to consider - if you use an `Iterator` method like `chain()`, the result is a new iterator type which also operates on `IoResults`. So, if `fail_on_error()` were implemented as a method of the `Lines` iterator and you wanted to iterate over the lines of two files, you would need to write:\n\n``` rust\nfor x in file1.lines().fail_on_error().chain(file2.lines().fail_on_error()) { ... }\n```\n\nHowever, with `fail_on_error()` implemented as an extension method, you could write the above, or you could write:\n\n``` rust\nfor x in file1.lines().chain(file2.lines()).fail_on_error() { ... }\n```\n\nWhich I think reads a bit nicer. Also, I think its a bit more user-friendly - `fail_on_error()` having different ordering requirements than `chain()` or `skip()` could be a bit confusing.\n\nI haven't come up with a better name for `fail_on_error()`, but I'm open to suggestions.\n",

    "body": "The iterator extension traits seem difficult to discover, and I'm coming around to think that they may not be necessary at all. We have the `unwrap()` method and the `try!` macro, so if we _really_ want to go forward with this, I think we should try without the iterator extensions first.\n\nI'm still a bit wary of whether this is the direction that we want to go in, the whole point is to make `lines()` an easy \"iterate over each line\" method, and this is moving it significantly away from that direction. I suppose using `.unwrap()` isn't so bad though:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::io;\n\nfn main() {\n    for line in io::stdin().lines() {\n        print!(\"received: {}\", line.unwrap());\n    }\n}\n```\n",

    "body": "I agree that discoverability is an issue. Putting the extension in the prelude would somewhat address the issue, however, then there is a magic method that shows up somewhat out of nowhere.\n\nAnyway, I'm also of the opinion that the extension trait isn't necessary. In my opinion what is important is that all of the APIs in the standard library should be a) correct and b) easy to use, in that order. If an API isn't correct, ease of use becomes a bad thing since it will just spread the problem farther, faster, and with a lower chance that people look up the documentation. Ignoring errors makes the particular 5 line program under discussion look mildly nicer; however, it also makes the API impossible to use in anything non-trivial - if I want to iterate over the lines of a file _and_ I also want to handle errors, where's my lines() method? What I'm getting at is I think we should make these iterators correct and consistent first and then try to figure out if there is some nice sugar to make that particular example prettier.\n\nI've rebased the PR to remove the extension traits and to just change the iterators to produce IoResults.\n",

Since `lines()` swallows errors, the result is that it also swallows the error about the file not existing. Rust's #[must_use] annotation doesn't help. Forcing the caller to unwrap the `IoResult`, reveals the issue, however.\n",
