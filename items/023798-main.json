  "body": "Previously a panic was generated for recursive prints due to a double-borrow of\na `RefCell`. This was solved by the second borrow's output being directed\ntowards the global stdout instead of the per-thread stdout (still experimental\nfunctionality).\n\nAfter this functionality was altered, however, recursive prints still deadlocked\ndue to the overridden `write_fmt` method which locked itself first and then\nwrote all the data. This was fixed by removing the override of the `write_fmt`\nmethod. This means that unlocked usage of `write!` on a `Stdout`/`Stderr` may be\nslower due to acquiring more locks, but it's easy to make more performant with a\ncall to `.lock()`.\n\nCloses #23781\n",
