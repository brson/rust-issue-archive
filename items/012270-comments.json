    "body": "All the style fixes look great to me, but did you see a perf improvement when siwtching from `println!` to `BufferedWriter`? When using `println!` you're using a `LineBufferedWriter`, so I wouldn't expect the performance to increase too much. Stylistically-wise, I prefer using `println!`, but if you saw a good deal of perf gain it's fine.\n",
