    "body": "I tested it a bit, and the issue seems to be `error_reporting` is fed slightly different information each time. In the first case we have a `SubSupConflict(ReFree, ReFree)` and in the second `SubSupConflict(ReScope, ReScope)`.\n\nIn the constraint graph for some node `'v` we are trying to infer, there are multiple incoming edges and outgoing edges to and from `'v`. From my understanding the compiler only picks one node from these incoming edges and one node from these outgoing edges, and it doesn't pick the same pair each time (what I don't understand is why I didn't see the `SubSupConflict(ReFree, ReScope)` and `SubSupConflict(ReScope, ReFree)` variations).\n",
