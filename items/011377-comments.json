    "body": "This would not protect against overflow on the main thread, but according to this semi-related bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=698528 it's pretty standard for there to be unmapped areas after the main thread's stack.\n\nSo sounds like the main task is taken care of and we just need to deal with spawned sub-tasks. It also appears that we by default have guard pages on all threads, but we should guarantee this by invoking the `pthread` call.\n\nWith this information, this is certainly not a high-priority issue, but it would be nice to guarantee.\n",
