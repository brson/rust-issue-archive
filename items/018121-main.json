  "body": "Convert trait method dispatch to use new trait matching machinery.\n\nThis fixes about 90% of #17918. What remains to be done is to make inherent dispatch work with conditional dispatch as well. I plan to do this in a future patch by generalizing the \"method match\" code slightly to work for inherent impls as well (the basic algorithm is precisely the same).\n\nFixes #17178.\n\nThis is a [breaking-change] for two reasons:\n1. The old code was a bit broken. I found various minor cases, particularly around operators, where the old code incorrectly matched, but an extra `*` or other change is now required. (See commit e8cef25 (\"Correct case where the old version of method lookup...\") for examples.)\n2. The old code didn't type check calls against the method signature from the _trait_ but rather the _impl_. The two can be different in subtle ways. This makes the new method dispatch both more liberal and more conservative than the original. (See commit 8308332 (\"The new method lookup mechanism typechecks...\") for examples.)\n\nr? @pcwalton since he's been reviewing most of this series of changes\nf? @nick29581 for commit 39df55f (\"Permit DST types to unify like other types\")\ncc @aturon as this relates to library stabilization\n",
