    "body": "Hm, so now I think I'm a little confused! This was indeed breakage that snuck into LLVM at some point which then snuck back out [around the time of the release](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commit/41585aa62adf581f4ce31d670ae516f813736db3). I made this change in the source because our Travis builder is now installing LLVM from their apt repos which have this change. Now those repos also report that the LLVM version is 3.7.0, so I thought that this actually made its way into the 3.7.0 release and I forgot to include it.\n\nIf they update their repos every night, though, and don't bump the version just yet, that may also explain it! I'm all for supporting as many versions of LLVM as possible, but I'm not sure how to detect at compile-time the \"true 3.7.0 release\" vs \"what's in LLVM's apt repos\" now...\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton according to http://llvm.org/apt/ the packages are indeed built from the latest commit on the respective branches (see `Technical aspects` down at the bottom).\n\nSo I see three options:\n\n1) Don't support the true 3.7.0 and move on.\n2) Wait for the packages to get their patch level bumped and then add support for true 3.7.0 and accept build failures with the intermediate versions.\n3) Add a test to do a compile check to see which version we have.\n\n3 seems like overkill. And 2 is probably not really worth it, because I expect distros not to pick up 3.7.0 for their stable releases because of this API breakage. And users should really use 3.7.1 instead once that comes out.\n\nSo I'd say let's close this for now, and maybe do 2 later, if any distro does indeed package 3.7.0 in a stable release.\n",
