    "body": "Hi Graydon,\n\nThe patches have been updated.\n\nI'd really rather not get into formatting discussions at this point, since we have plans to use the pretty-printer to make all that moot. Please accept my compressed one-liners until then.\n\nAs for constants, adding a few of them did clarify things. I left the bitmasks as hex literals, since a constant named last_six_bits_set or so seems more indirect than 0x3f.\n\nRegarding the refcounting in str_push_byte... My first attempt would deref v when allocating a new one, and leave the ref as is in the other case. However, this led to double-free errors. My conclusion is that rust expects a refcounted value returned from a foreign call to be 'new', in that it already has a refcount bump (or was initialized with refcount 1). Thus, when returning a value that was an argument to the foreign call, you have to bump its refcount. `s = rustrc.str_push_byte(s, X)` will decrement this refcount again when overwriting the old reference.\n\nI added a clearer comment about the rustboot workaround at https://github.com/marijnh/rust/blob/master/src/lib/_str.rs#L292 .\n\nBest,\nMarijn\n",
