    "body": "From a theoretical perspective, relating the MIR to a CPS version of Rust, I also agree that calls should always terminate a basic block. This implies that every basic block in MIR corresponds exactly to a lambda-expression in CPS, and (proper Rust) functions never return; they always call a return continuation. If functions in MIR could live in the middle of a basic block, that would correspond to a function returning back to its caller in the CPS, which should just never be the case.\n\nWhether functions take a return continuation, a panic continuation, or both - that's of course completely flexible.\n",
