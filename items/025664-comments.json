    "body": "I would like to take this issue up again.\n\nWhat is the status?\nWhere is help needed?\n\nSpecifically on [licenses and copyright claims repeated in source code files](e.g. [`mk/main.mk`]%28https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a005b6785935d7e92e87774c8f585839ddd12e46/mk/main.mk#L1-L9%29), I hope we will soon make good improvement across the board. I propose that we remove them or reduce them to at most a single line. \n\n**Arguments**\n1. They hurt readability and conciseness;\n2. They are a small extra hurdle to contributing changes (esp. from the GitHub web UI) since it makes you scroll down on every file;\n3. Their use across source files violates the do-not-repeat-yourself principle;\n4. Probably in large part due to the previous, they are undermaintained. E.g. something as basic as the year is messed up [in a prominent place](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7bf54f90d619fc87af4c8b660a80166c40048cb5/src/bootstrap/mk/Makefile.in#L1).\n\n**Issues, my positions on them**\nA. Who supports [this position](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/125841), that a single central license file in each repo should be used exclusively instead? I do, for sure. Only for GPL and/or mixed licensing it may be required to refer to the GPL again at the top of every file, but if we do then let us please use a one-line comment referring to the license file.\n\nB. Who supports my position that a copyright claim is redundant, and that dating the copyright is even more redundant (certainly as the project keeps record using a VCS), and should be removed everywhere as a maintenance burden?\n\n@brson: What has led to the situation that [multiple licenses are applicable to the `rust-lang` code base](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust#license)? What can still be done to harmonize this to a single license? \n",

    "body": "@sanmai-NL the issues you are raising seem to be different from this issue, which is about ensuring that individual rust-lang repos declare a license (and on that basis I think we can close this issue - most of the remaining undeclared repos are not worth the effort). So you might consider opening another issue if you think the Rust source copyright is not handled properly.\n\nThat said, the exact handling of the license declarations in this repo has been debated repeatedly over the years and I suspect there isn't much enthusiasm for re-litigating any aspect of it. The current scheme is as recommended by Mozilla legal long ago. It is true though that if we were to do it over with the benefit of hindsight I suspect we would push harder not to have the notice at the top of each file, nor to mention the copyright year. [Here is an old discussion on the copyright year](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9070). We decided that mentioning the copyright year is useless, and that they should not be updated.\n\nThe primary Rust codebase is Apache licensed because we want a permissive license with a patent non-aggression clause; it is MIT licensed because the GPLv2 is not compatible with the Apache license. Other licenses apply because Rust includes source from other projects such as LLVM. None of this can be changed with any reasonable amount of effort.\n",

    "body": "@brson\nYeah it's a different issue but they are quite interrelated I think. This thread seemed to be the best to discuss the extra issue. \n\n[You wrote in that thread](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9070#issuecomment-31860335) that the copyright notice at the top is not important legally, or so you had been advised (I assume by a legal professional). So I take it that removing them would be all right. I understand few will have appetite to consult legal professionals again though, if that's really what's needed.\n\nIrrelevant or not, the top copyright notice, especially with years with typos etc., and if long, is a bit of a nuisance I think so I suggest you just get rid of it.\n\nI wonder whether not declaring a license, even for small repos, is legally wise. Not just from a perspective of guarding against copyright infringement but also to foster re-use.\n",

    "body": "@apiraino since that comment, the github organization had new repos added to it. I went over the non-fork repos in the rust-lang organization and found the following repos without a top-level LICENSE file:\n\n- [x] [docker-rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust)\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust/issues/207\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust/pull/74\n- [x] [docker-rust-nightly](https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust-nightly) (the repository has been archived, the licensing is now being done in `docker-rust`)\n- [ ] [crater](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater) mentions a license in README, even though the license files are not included in the repo\n- [x] [bors](https://github.com/rust-lang/bors): [bootstrap commit](https://github.com/rust-lang/bors/commit/bb146113e158f7764b78847cf833cd8f74cadc7d)\n- [x] [surveys](https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys)\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/issues/267\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/pull/266\n- [x] [rustc-perf](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf)\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1933\n  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1881\n- [x] [fmt-rfcs](https://github.com/rust-lang/fmt-rfcs): [pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/fmt-rfcs/pull/174)\n- [ ] [.github](https://github.com/rust-lang/.github)\n- [ ] [rust-lang.github.io](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-lang.github.io)\n\nPlus a bunch of workgroup/team repos:\n\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/project-rfc-2229 (archived)\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-debugging (archived)\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-cargo-std-aware\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/moderation-team\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-incr-comp (archived)\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team-prioritization\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-timing (archived)\n\nSo this issue should very much not be closed, but thanks for pinging this issue because it motivated this mini-survey of mine.",
