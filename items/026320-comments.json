    "body": "Yeah, I suspect the real confusion here is that the `Fn()` syntax with parens has not yet been introduced (nor is it explained anywhere, apparently), so it's the wrong example at this point in the document, and it's not clear to a first-time reader what is being referred to. It seems like there should be a sufficient example here that doesn't use closures, maybe one simple one with `println!` and `Display`, and one using traits over collections or iterators or something, to demonstrate that parameterized types can appear in the bounds, to make it easier to understand.\n\nThat said, the reference is explicitly not intended to be pedagogical, and implicitly not yet expected to be complete.\n",
