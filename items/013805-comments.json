    "body": "I thought if you have the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables set, it will use those compilers.  I haven't checked closely recently; is the problem that we only support those environment variables during `make` itself, and not during the execution of the `configure` script?\n\nAnyway, we should try to make sure that some functionality of this sort works.  (Though I don't think it would be a release blocker.)\n\nAlso, I am not sure we would be able to remove `--enable-ccache` if we fixed this issue. In particular we have at least one `ccache` specific hack to avoid spurious warnings from `clang` on a `ccache-miss`; you can review some of those details by looking at PR #6805.\n",
