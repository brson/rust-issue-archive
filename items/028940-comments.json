    "body": "By looking at [the code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/sys/windows/os.rs), it seems that `home_dir` already utilizes `GetUserProfileDirectory`, which is a bit more portable option than `SHGetKnownFolderPath` (albeit Rust basically targets Vista, so this won't be much a concern). The thing is, `%HOME%` and `%USERPROFILE%` are _explicitly_ checked first before using the Windows API. I guess this is an intended behavior to enable the exact overriding behavior you described (so that you could get the \"incorrect\" path by setting `%HOME%` manually), but I'm not very sure. Could you confirm, @alexcrichton?\n\nAs for `temp_dir`, it is already using `GetTempPath` to return the appropriate path. The reason why the Rust documentation says it checks the environment variables is that it is exactly [the behavior described in MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364992%28v=vs.85%29.aspx). It states: \"The GetTempPath function checks for the existence of environment variables in the following order and uses the first path found\". And also, `SHGetKnownFolderPath` seems to not support the temporary directory.\n",

In that case, I'd say this is bad documentation - not mentioning `GetUserProfileDirectory()` seems to be an oversight, and we should be describing the _actual_ behaviour of `env::get_temp()` on Windows even if the _effective_ behaviour is the same as what's described now, because that's not what I expected, and certainly not what others will expect. That and, of course, `GetTempPath()` could always change or be deprecated in the future, and then the docs would be wrong anyway.\n",

    "body": "> I'll also note that this basically matches what python does as well as what ruby does. My personal opinion is that it's working as intended.\n\nAnd in every case it just makes the user experience [worse](https://github.com/Diggsey/multirust-rs/issues/12) on windows. The convention for getting the home directory on windows is (obviously) to use the helpfully provided OS functions to do so. That's what .net, java and other software does, that has a runtime which is actually written for windows, and is not just a barely functioning wrapper in order to provide a unix-like interface.\n\nAt best, the python and ruby interpreters can be slightly let off the hook as they are scripting languages, and so you might expect behaviour to be a little \"fuzzy\" with respect to the environment. At worst, they're shoving unix-like conventions onto a platform where they don't work or belong.\n\nIt's also one of the reasons why msys doesn't try to override the `%USERPROFILE%` environment variable: native windows software isn't _supposed_ to change behaviour when run from msys: the only way msys functions properly is if native windows software is oblivious to it.\n\nIf you want a unix-like environment on windows, then _target msys or cygwin_ - it's what they're there for after all... If you don't, then don't start looking for unix environment variables!\n",
