    "body": "@huonw I had some concern about possible side effects on PDF and ePUB outputs by Pandoc as I don't have Pandoc installed on my machine...\n\nI'll use the paragraph saying \"the following strings\" itself as a marker because it _almost_ guarantees the following element is the keyword table and I can expect less impact on Pandoc outputs than an empty DIV would do (if any.)\n\nLet me also do piggybacking of some typographical changes.  The result will look like [this](https://github.com/nodakai/rust/tree/really-fix-kw-table/src/doc)\n",
