    "body": "As discussed on IRC, I think this is basically a bug in the operator dispatch code, but one whose symptoms could be alleviated in a number of ways:\n1. The proposed reform the `==` operator so that it takes two type parameters would help.\n2. Variance (#3598) would help.\n3. Introducing another type variable to allow for the lifetimes to be inexact would help, and would presumably also eliminate the need for the \"reborrow\" that we do.\n\nI'm not sure which of these three is best.\n",
