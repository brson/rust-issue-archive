  "body": "This update brings a few months of changes, but primarily a fix for the\nfollowing situation.\n\nWhen creating a handle to stdin, libuv used to set the stdin handle to\nnonblocking mode. This would end up affect this stdin handle across all\nprocesses that shared it, which mean that stdin become nonblocking for everyone\nusing the same stdin. On linux, this also affected _stdout_ because stdin/stdout\nroughly point at the same thing.\n\nThis problem became apparent when running the test suite manually on a local\ncomputer. The stdtest suite (running with libgreen) would set stdout to\nnonblocking mode (as described above), and then the next test suite would always\nfail for a printing failure (because stdout was returning EAGAIN).\n\nThis has been fixed upstream, joyent/libuv@342e8c, and this update pulls in this\nfix. This also brings us in line with a recently upstreamed libuv patch.\n\nCloses #12827\nCloses #13336\nCloses #13355\n",
