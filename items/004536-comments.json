Should children be able to access its parent's privates? Should this extend to all ancestor modules?\n\nIf so, it should be easy to fix I think. For each resolve that \"fails\" due to privacy, check if the module is a child of wherever it resolved to, and if so, don't actually fail the resolve.\n\nThis happens in `resolve_single_import`, which is a huge function in resolve.rs. Should probably be handled in/around src/librustc/middle/resolve.rs:2434 (handily, I refactored this code to enable this enabling the \"it's private\" error).\n\nIt shouldn't affect performance much, I don't think, especially since it's so rare (the error path is hit very rarely afaict).\n",
