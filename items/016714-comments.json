    "body": "We already decided in #14883 that `Show` is not appropriate for `RefCell` because `RefCell` borrowing is fallable and `Show` should never be.\n\nI believe the same argument applies to `Eq` and `Hash`. None of these traits should be fallable, and therefore are not suitable for `RefCell`.\n\nThat said, #15411 implemented `Encodable`/`Decodable` on `RefCell`, even though I would think the argument applies there as well. I missed that when it happened or I would have argued against it at the time. /cc @alexcrichton who approved it.\n",

    "body": "As I [commented on the PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15411#issuecomment-48094933) and as [the code says](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libserialize/serialize.rs#L555-L558), the encoding aspect is meant to not fail, but rather to return an error (because the encodable/decodable context allows it to). It is was a stopgap until we could have custom error strings for any encoder (as we can do now).\n\nAs noted, previous PRs to add `Show` have been declined for now due to the fallibility of `RefCell`. That said, I am sympathetic to any structure containing a `RefCell` basically doesn't work with `#[deriving]`, which is quite unfortunate.\n",

In this case, we'd need the ability to basically substitute an arbitrary expression for the field in the derived traits.\n",
