  "body": "If we copy in `Ordering` and use it with the following example we'll get a compile error as `==` has not been defined.\n\nI chose to introduce `deriving(Eq, PartialEq)` but refer to the later discussion (which I assume is going to come). I'm not sure about the formulation however.\n\nIt could have been fine to use `match`, but it hasn't been presented yet. In the next example though we _are_ using `match` in the example code, so we could do it here as well. But I'm more inclined to remove the use of `match` there as well as it might be a bit confusing?\n\ncc @steveklabnik\n",
