    "body": "A test fails because the crate hash depends on the order of the dependencies in a `HashMap`. The `oldmap` implementation always used 0, 0 as the SipHash keys so the order was (wrongly) consistent. They get sorted by name but this test case is using two crates with the same name (different version) so the order is non-deterministic. With 2 dependencies, it generates one of 2 possible hashes, with 3 dependencies it generates one of 6 and so on.\n",
