Original PR description was:\n\n> `MethodOrigin` now only holds the optional `impl_def_id`, for trait methods, and `vtable_index`, for object methods.\n> \n> They could be both removed, at the cost of offloading computation to lints and trans, respectively.\n> In the case of `impl_def_id`, using `traits::select` in lints will provide a more accurate result.\n> As for `vtable_index`, it's possible we don't want middle or typeck to deal with vtable layout - or at least, it could be stored outside of `MethodOrigin`.\n> \n> `MethodOrigin::Inherent` could be distinguished from the other cases by checking that the container of the method is an `impl`.\n> `MethodOrigin::Object` can be replaced by an optimization for `VtableObject` in `trans::meth` - so that `object.method()` and `Trait::method(object)` produce the same IR (currently the latter always goes through the `<Trait as Trait>::method` shim).\n> \n> I haven't attempted to implement any of those potential refactors as they might not be entirely beneficial, though they should all be possible (with all of them, `MethodOrigin` would be gone).\n",
