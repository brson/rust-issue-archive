    "body": "[From the trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.Borrow.html):\n\n> Borrow is very similar to, but different than, AsRef. See the book (link) for more.\n\n[From the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/borrow-and-asref.html):\n\n> We can see how they\u2019re kind of the same: they both deal with owned and borrowed versions of some type. However, they\u2019re a bit different.\n> \n> Choose Borrow when you want to abstract over different kinds of borrowing, or when you\u2019re building a datastructure that treats owned and borrowed values in equivalent ways, such as hashing and comparison.\n\nHowever I agree it could be more prominent.\n",
