I'm sick of seeing other encodings leaking all over the place (especially in cases where people claimed \"yes, we use encoding X internally, but we will make sure that we don't leak it\").\n- remember that the \"length\" of a string, in terms of human perception (not in terms of \"amount of storage required\"), depends on many things, including the locale. This also applies to most other Unicode operations as well. Design the API with that in mind, not as an afterthought.\n",
