Some reworking needs to be done to keep the lint Context around and be able to register a set of lints specifically for trans.\n\nFrom there, it's just iterating over the tydescs hashmap in the CrateContext, checking if the size is greater than some epsilon, and looking through the ty::t's sty, pulling out the span for the given type, and emitting the warning.\n\nLinting for enum variants or linting on implicit copies seems to be a lot more difficult/non-obvious.\n",
