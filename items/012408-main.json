There appears to be a bug or two in how android loads\ndynamic libraries and for some reason libservo.so isn't being found.\n\nAs a temporary solution, add an extern \"C\" function to libstd which can be\ncalled if you have a handle to the crate map manually. When crawling the crate\nmap, we then check this manual symbol before falling back to the old solutions.\n\ncc #11731\n",
