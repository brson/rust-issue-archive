    "body": "I was a bit surprised that this isn't already done \u2013 especially in light of the fact that rust programs in publicized benchmarks appear to indulge in a bit more memory than corresponding C programs.\n\nLooking at memory consumption is also usually the first thing I do when trying to optimize code, and if the runtime is similar, I will take the solution which uses less memory. Reducing memory usage can lead to performance benefits elsewhere because of cache effects.\n\nBy the way, jemalloc has the `malloctl` function which allows to directly gather information of interest. `je_malloc_stats_print` is meant to be readable to a human, and there is no guarantee on what format it will print.\n\nAlso hijacking this issue a bit, would it be feasible to include `perf` counters in the benchmarking harness? Those may also show performance issues (e.g. cache misses, branch prediction misses, etc.) that the plain runtime cannot.\n",
