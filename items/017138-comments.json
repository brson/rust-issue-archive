It took me a while to consolidate `&`/`&mut`, `~` (now `box`), `clone`, `ref`, and move/copy semantics and understand the memory model properly enough to use it without fighting the compiler. While they're theoretically something different, practically they turn up in similar places. But I guess discussing it elsewhere is okay, as long as they are discussed :)\n",

Calling it just an \u2018Ownership\u00a0Guide\u2019 would make it much harder to find. Perhaps this could be the \u2018Ownership and Lifetimes Guide\u2019, if only for the sake of discoverability?\n\nI suppose that if this is linked to from the tutorial it wouldn\u2019t be _too_ bad, but chances are at least some people will skip that link until they bump into a lifetime-/ownership-related error.\n",
