    "body": "@pcwalton and I were discussing another option for comparing types. If we can guarantee that every nominal type's type descriptor is represented by a distinct pointer (there are no duplicates across crates) then we can use traits to restrict type comparisons to only nominal types.\n\nMaybe something like this:\n\n```\ntrait TypeEq {\n  static fn eq<A: TypeEq, B: TypeEq>() -> bool;\n}\n```\n\nThen `TlsKey` could derive from `TypeEq`.\n\nIt is possible to compare structural types so we should probably consider that someday we'll inevitably want an interface for that too.\n",
