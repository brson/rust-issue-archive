    "body": "I believe this is not an issue. `Bar` in your example may very well be instantiated with a type parameter without lifetime bound in it. So indeed `'a` is not used in that case.\n\nIf you want to express \"either a bare type or a reference\", then an enum suits you well (though I'm not sure why you'd want to do that):\n\n``` rust\nenum Foo<'a, T:'a+?Sized> {\n    A(T),\n    B(&'a T),\n}\n\nstruct Bar<'a, T:'a+?Sized> {\n    b: Foo<'a, T>,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let _ = Bar { b: Foo::A(10) };\n    let _ = Bar { b: Foo::B(&\"rust\") };\n}\n```\n",
