  "body": "The nightly builds on linux have been failing over the past few days due to a\nmalformed LD_LIBRARY_PATH. It appears that the underlying cause is that one of\nthe tests, dep-info-custom, recursively invokes make but the RUSTC variable\npassed down has the string \"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\". This is intended to read the\nhost's original LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but it appears that the makefile is eagerly\nexpanding the \"$L\" to nothing, causing the original host's LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be\nignored.\n\nThis fix removes passing the string \"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\" and rather expands it\neagerly to ensure that escaping doesn't happen at a later stage. I'm still not\nentirely sure why the makefile is interpreting the dollar as a variable, but\nthis seems to fix the issue.\n",
