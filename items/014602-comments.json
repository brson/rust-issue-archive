I think you make a good case for an `Option` type here.\n\nI would vastly prefer changing the return types of existing functions instead of adding `at_opt` and `name_opt`. They increase the API needlessly IMO. The library is marked experimental so we don't have to worry about backwards compatibility. :-)\n",
