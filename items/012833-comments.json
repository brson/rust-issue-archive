    "body": "@alexcrichton Any library that needs to select across I/O alone, or I/O and channels, is forced to use the workaround of two channels/tasks per I/O. Superfluous tasks that are expected to be blocked for 99% of their life is a decent fit for libgreen tasks but is pretty crappy for libnative threads. But libraries don't have any control over their threading (unless their API is such that they're capable of setting up their own task pool and blocking on it, but that's uncommon).\n",
