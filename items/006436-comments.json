If you dropped a process that failed to spawn you just deadlocked forever (should have had an assertion preventing this).\n2. If you fail to spawn, you still need to call `uv_close` on the handle you passed into `uv_spawn` because it doesn't de-initialize it (even though it wasn't initialized beforehand...)\n\nRegardless, now I've almost made it through `make check`. This gets all the way to running the rpass benchmarks, and then I hit a deadlock again. Will continue investigating, and will try to keep this updated.\n",
