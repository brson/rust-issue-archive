I want to gather more opinions about this feature, especially because, I came to believe that this is a lot harder than \"putting a few more wires in place\" and considerably delicate feature to implement.\n\n---\n\nThis commit uses an existing foreign inlining facility to implement the doc generation from compiled crates. At the highest level, this is a _huge_ hack since the metadata doesn't provide everything we need to generate docs.\n\nFixes #2206. Will fix #15309 once integrated with Makefile.\n",
