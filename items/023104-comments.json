    "body": "@aturon Alright, I'll look into it. One worry is that I think it may not be possible to `Int`/`Float` right off the bat, because they are used as bounds in some places (libtest comes to mind). So, I'll add the `impl u8/f32/etc` but leave those traits around. We can decide how to deal with them later, perhaps move them to rust-lang/num? Since I think libtest will also be moved out of rust-lang/rust.\n\n@alexcrichton \n\n> could you give the primitive pages a quick glance to make sure all the methods are listed?\n\nI can't check right now, but I did check them before, and IIRC all the methods were listed. The issue was that there were _two_ primitive `char` pages (see my previous comment). I'll look into this, and include a link a github page with all the docs for the review of the final version of this PR. Thanks for the heads up!\n",

    "body": "@japaric \n\n> Alright, I'll look into it. One worry is that I think it may not be possible to `Int`/`Float` right off the bat, because they are used as bounds in some places (libtest comes to mind). So, I'll add the `impl u8/f32/etc` but leave those traits around. We can decide how to deal with them later, perhaps move them to rust-lang/num? Since I think libtest will also be moved out of rust-lang/rust.\n\nRight, that's pretty much exactly the rollout plan I had in mind. Part of the motivation here is to do away with those traits within `std` itself, pushing this concern to the crates.io ecosystem. If you can introduce the inherent methods, I can take care of the rest.\n",

    "body": "OK, this is _mostly_ done. There is a summary of the changes at the top, along with a preview of the docs (I haven't look at them closely yet). This branch passes `check-stage1` as it is but needs a rebase.\n\nThere is one caveat: Because `libcollections` now contains lang items, is not easy to run its unit tests with `rustc --test` because it results in conflicting lang items - this is a known issue. I discussed this with @alexcrichton, and we decided that easiest path forward was to split the unit tests into its own crate (a la core and coretest). However, after the split some unit tests no longer compile because they require access to the private fields of some structs. For now I've commented out these tests, but these tests need to be re-enabled before landing this.\n\nHow to deal with these tests? I see two alternatives right now: (a) we rewrite the tests to not access private fields, not sure if this is possible for all the tests, or (b) we move these tests back to libcollections, making this work can be tricky due to the original problem of conflicting lang items.\n\nI'll take a look at the second option tonight.\n\ncc @Gankro Do you think it would be possible to modify the commented out tests [1] to not access private fields while retaining the intention of the tests?\n\n[1] See the \"extract libcollections tests into libcollectionstest\" commit, the tests are marked with \"FIXME(japaric) privacy\".\n",

    "body": "Oof, migrating some of these tests would be really nasty. One option is to expose privates in `doc(hidden)` methods. The maintenance burden would be minimal, and anyone who uses them would be _super_ at fault.\n\nFor specific tests:\n\nThe Vec::permutations one I'd probably just toss the offending check as \"whatever\" (I'd also toss the permutations _api_ myself but that's just me).\n\nLinkedList's integrity check could be made a doc(hidden) test, although honestly I don't think it's particularly _necessary_ to perform the check at all. LinkedList is my nemesis but it's not exactly mind-blowing complexity. Also you can emulate the checks by just providing a slice of the expected values and iterating forwards and backwards.\n\nVecDeque is probably the toughest case. We totally abuse access to the internals for two things: minimum-cost bench resets, and enumerating every possible internal state of the Deque. In _theory_ you could do a whole mess of pushy-pops to slide the head of the list to exactly the right position, but that would perhaps be a bit fragile on top of being slower and more tedious. The check that `head < tail` is _mostly_ gratuitous, although I think it was added in response to an actual impl bug.\n\nI don't see why enum_set is commented out; it looks like everything there is using the public API?\n",

From an API standpoint I think this change is fine largely because it doesn't really change much. Overall, however, this seems like it's all a bit of a hack. \n\nWe're basically bending the language to our whim to enable this sort of functionality because we control the compiler, but from the perspective of some other hypothetical compiler implementor this becomes quite a pain. We're adding all these special cases for these very implementation-specific set of `impl` blocks for each primitive. Put another way, we've found the language inadequate for our desires so we're getting around that with some slight of hand that doesn't come up too much but likely will at some point.\n\nI think the biggest pain points for me when reading this are:\n- Such a huge number of lang items were added.\n- Multiple inherent implementations on primitives is allowed\n\nThe lang item problem can probably be considered an implementation detail of the compiler, but allowing multiple inherent implementations makes me feel like something has gone awry somewhere. We don't have the luxury of always being able to bend the language so API design is a little easier, and I felt that the previous trait-per-primitive-in-the-prelude solution was quite adequate: it worked out well in terms of documentation, functionality, extensibility, and it was also consistent with the rest of the language.  \n",

Since each lang item is unique you can't have e.g. one inherent implementation per crate. Other way to see this implementation is that this is like e.g. `char` is defined in `libunicode` and can only have an inherent implementation in that crate (this is consistent with how coherence works), with the caveat that `char` is actually available everywhere because is part of the language/compiler.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton \n\nI respectfully disagree.\n\n> I'm starting to somewhat have second thoughts about this from a compiler implementation perspective. From an API standpoint I think this change is fine largely because it doesn't really change much. Overall, however, this seems like it's all a bit of a hack.\n\nI think it is quite valuable from an API perspective, but more on that below.\n\n> We're basically bending the language to our whim to enable this sort of functionality because we control the compiler, but from the perspective of some other hypothetical compiler implementor this becomes quite a pain. We're adding all these special cases for these very implementation-specific set of `impl` blocks for each primitive. Put another way, we've found the language inadequate for our desires so we're getting around that with some slight of hand that doesn't come up too much but likely will at some point.\n\nI think this is overstated in several ways.\n\nWhile we've moved many things into the libraries, the problem here is precisely to do with _primitive types_, which are specifically types that cannot be defined in the language itself and must be taken as given. In particular, I see adding inherent impls for these types as _bringing them up to parity_ with other library types; currently, we cannot follow standard conventions or API design for these special types! That is, this isn't \"bending the language to our whim\", it's making sure that primitive types and user-defined types work in more similar ways.\n\n> I think the biggest pain points for me when reading this are:\n> - Such a huge number of lang items were added.\n\nThat by itself doesn't seem like a problem to me. The point here is to uniformly add the ability to give inherent methods for primitive types, and there are many primitive types.\n\n> - Multiple inherent implementations on primitives is allowed\n\nI can see how this aspect feels a bit more hacky/implementation-specific. It's basically tied to the facade setup. But see below.\n\n> The lang item problem can probably be considered an implementation detail of the compiler, but allowing multiple inherent implementations makes me feel like something has gone awry somewhere. We don't have the luxury of always being able to bend the language so API design is a little easier, and I felt that the previous trait-per-primitive-in-the-prelude solution was quite adequate: it worked out well in terms of documentation, functionality, extensibility, and it was also consistent with the rest of the language.  \n\nIt's a little difficult to tease apart the various concerns here. It seems like you're making a slippery slope kind of argument that this is \"bending the language\" but as I argued above, at least the idea of having inherent impls for primitive types it just making the language more internally consistent between primitive and user-defined types.\n\nAs to the question of having multiple inherent impls, that is indeed one sense in which this PR goes beyond what the language provides elsewhere. However, I consider this, like all other aspects of the facade, a hidden and changeable implementation detail. The commitment here is just to have _some_ inherent methods visible in `std`, but the precise way that is broken down is up for grabs. (I personally don't mind the inherent split, but we could certainly discuss changing it; however, I don't think it should block this PR since it can be tweaked later.)\n\nAs to the status quo: I personally disagree that it worked out quite well. In particular, it is already difficult for newcomers to Rust to understand how Deref and dispatch work together to make methods show up for things like `Vec`, but then the fact that the relevant methods were defined on an extension trait add that much more of a barrier. In addition, for the numeric types, the traits are routinely misunderstood as being intended for full-blown generic programming over numerics, and they aren't suited for that. (That latter could be addressed by introducing separate extension traits for each type.)\n\nI think that when it comes to the primitive types of the language, we should make things as simple and transparent as possible. People have to learn a lot of things when they come to Rust, and not having inherent methods on our basic types is both inconsistent with other types and adds yet another indirection for something very basic.\n",

    "body": "@eddyb \n\n> Does that seem like less of a hack to you?\n\nFor me personally I don't think so. It looks like you're introducing a new type `i32` which is an `enum` (not the primitive) in that statement, which feels odd to me. Additionally, it doesn't remove the need for extension traits due to the facade which to me reduces its utility. I haven't spent a great deal of time digesting it, though, so I may be missing pieces here and there.\n\n---\n\n@japaric \n\n> Just to clarify, only a single inherent implementation, the one marked with the lang item, is permitted per primitive\n\nOh I apologize, I have gotten the wrong impression! I seem to remember in a previous incarnation there was a `core_char` and `unicode_char` impl block, but I see now that the traits remain in libcore and the inherent impls only show up later.\n\n---\n\n@aturon \n\n> That is, this isn't \"bending the language to our whim\", it's making sure that primitive types and user-defined types work in more similar ways.\n\nTo me this isn't necessarily a good thing, though. To me it's unclear whether the primitive types should behave the same as user-defined types because they really are special (compiler-defined). To me there's kinda understanding concerns here:\n1. Understanding how methods are available on primitives\n2. Understanding what methods are available on primitives\n\nToday we excel at 1 for primitives because everyone puts methods on them the same way, through traits. I do agree though that 2 is lacking today because one has to look at trait implementations for methods.\n\nThis PR, however, inverts the situation in my mind. Point 2 we start to excel at because the documentation for primitives looks the same as all other types (plus you don't have to import anything to get the methods). Point 1, however, becomes a little more confusing. For example someone may have the question \"wait, can't inherent methods only be defined on types defined in a crate?\".\n\nI think I'm leaning towards importance on point 1 whereas you prefer point 2, but I may be getting persuaded as well.\n\n> > Multiple inherent implementations on primitives is allowed\n> \n> I can see how this aspect feels a bit more hacky/implementation-specific. It's basically tied to the facade setup. \n\nAh this point is actually moot due to my misunderstanding of the implementation (cleared up [by @japaric](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23104#issuecomment-78538419)).\n\n> It seems like you're making a slippery slope kind of argument that this is \"bending the language\"\n\nBeing my usual self, I do think this is one of my concerns :). I somewhat fear that we still consider having the ability to do so this late in the game, eventually we won't have this \"escape hatch\". That being said I also understand the point that there is no better time to make this change than now.\n\n> As to the question of having multiple inherent impls\n\nAlthough my understanding was off, I just wanted to make sure that a concern brought up by @eddyb on IRC was listed here. In this PR libcore does not contain an inherent impl for `str`, it is instead in libcollections. This goes against the \"inherent implementations are only allowed in the defining crate\" and could in theory have unintended consequences on coherence at some point. For now, though, I do think that we're somewhat safe where we can consider the \"defining crate\" as the standard library and worry about the `no_std` case later.\n\n> As to the status quo: I personally disagree that it worked out quite well ... but then the fact that the relevant methods were defined on an extension trait add that much more of a barrier\n\nI'm a little surprised that the methods are hard to discover, the [documentation page for `str`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html), for example, has all of the methods listed at the bottom b/c trait impls are shown. I also feel like this concern is separable from whether we use traits or inherent methods because this can arguably all be fixed via rustdoc.\n\n> In addition, for the numeric types, the traits are routinely misunderstood as being intended for full-blown generic programming over numerics, and they aren't suited for that.\n\nThis is a good point that I had forgotten!\n\n> People have to learn a lot of things when they come to Rust, and not having inherent methods on our basic types is both inconsistent with other types and adds yet another indirection for something very basic.\n\nI'm not sure I totally agree with this concern, it seems objective to me. I believe that for something like `str` that a newcomer doesn't really care whether the `contains` method is inherent or imported via a trait. To me it seems like the pain point is the numeric traits which, as you mentioned, could be solved with a trait-per-primitive.\n\n---\n\nAll in all I'm not quite sure how I still feel about this change. My objection of multiple inherent impl blocks motivated me to write my comment, but that was a misunderstanding so I'm not sure that there is sufficient motivation to push back on this. I think it's basically the same in my mind to have either inherent methods or a trait-per-primitive _from the std perspective_.\n",

    "body": "Good discussion. Some thoughts from my side :) I tried to quote and respond directly to people but found it hard to confine what I wanted to say to that format, so I'll just ramble a bit instead.\n\nFirst off, while lang items are not standardized, if were going to produce a full reference version of the language, we would have to standardize at least some of them. `UnsafeCell`, `PhantomData`, the `Copy` trait, etc, are all types that bend the normal rules. I'm not sure why it should be so problematic to have an impl that bends the normal rules (unless the _way_ that it bends them is a problem).\n\nDue to these lang items, the rust language basically already requires that all Rust crates can be arrange into a tree with a single root, the \"standard library\" (at present, this is always libstd, but I imagine it can be changed over time). Furthermore, it seems natural to consider the primitive types to be \"local\" to this root crate. In that case, the fact that the root crate can define inherent impls on the primitive types makes total sense and is not inconsistent with our existing system. So it shouldn't be surprising to users that they can't make inherent methods on `i32` any more than they can make inherent methods on `Vec` or `Option`.\n\nThis is somewhat complicated by the existence of the facade -- when you zoom into the root crate, it turns out to have some structure to it (I really want to make some metaphor about quarks and atoms, but anyway). But I feel like this is ultimately a kind of minor concern. For the vast majority of Rust programs, and all stable Rust programs, libstd is the root crate and is indivisible.\n\nIn the future, I imagine there will be some alternative standard libraries. They will all use libcore; but if we adopt this approach, it seems likely that they will have the responsibility / option of defining the methods on primitive types as well. I guess I'd be happier if all of the primitive methods could be confined to libcore, because then the root crate analogy is airtight, but ultimately I feel... more-or-less ok with saying that we will eventually stabilize the mechanisms you need to define your own \"root crate\" like \"libstd\", and that libcore and the other components of the facade are kind of pseudo-crates that you can reuse for this purpose. \n\nDoes that make sense to anyone else?\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis \n\n> Furthermore, it seems natural to consider the primitive types to be \"local\" to this root crate.\n\nI was talking about this with @aturon, but I think this may be a key point that I disagree on. I view the primitives as not having a defining crate because they're defined in the language itself. Emulating a \"defining crate\" (facade present or not) seems out of place to me. I think my motivation for this thinking is that `i32` is available to _all rust programs in existence_, not just those that link to libstd (or even libcore). Someone using libstd2 can have an `i32` which interoperates with libstd's `i32` (morally speaking, duplicate lang items would probably hinder this for other reasons).\n\n> In that case, the fact that the root crate can define inherent impls on the primitive types makes total sense and is not inconsistent with our existing system.\n\nGiven the assumption that libstd is \"defining primitives\", I totally agree with this and the conclusions that follow. I just disagree on the premise :)\n\n> But I feel like this is ultimately a kind of minor concern. For the vast majority of Rust programs, and all stable Rust programs, libstd is the root crate and is indivisible.\n\nDepending on the route we're taking, the facade has differing degrees of how much it factors in I think. I believe that the current implementation by @japaric definition makes it so the facade doesn't matter much (as you pointed out). A strategy like @eddyb's, however, would be greatly affected by the facade.\n\nI also do want to at least consider a possible future where libcore is `#[stable]` and part of the main distribution. I would personally find it a little jarring (not the end of the world though of course) to find the behavior different between std crates and `no_std` crates (e.g. what this PR does).\n\nAlthough I do agree that the facade and/or non-libstd use cases shouldn't play a huge part in the decision for now, just a factor to consider!\n\n---\n\nAs an aside, thanks for taking time to write up responses @nikomatsakis and @aturon!\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton so I was talking to @aturon about this a bit more and thinking about your claim regarding libcore. It seems like what you are saying, basically, is that it would be nice if there could be alternatives to libstd that lived in (say) cargo and which can be combined with libstd code. This is somewhat at odds with my \"std is a root crate\" concept. I think it's a noble goal, though it carries some downsides (namely, increased risk of fragmentation).\n\nHowever, even if we did nothing else but standardize libcore, crates that rely on libstd could still interoperate with libstd, they just wouldn't enjoy inherent methods on integers and so forth. But we might also consider whether we want to integrate inherent methods into the trait system somehow so that it is possible to have multiple sets of \"inherent\" methods (and perhaps one must somehow pick-and-choose which one to use?). Variations on this theme have been requested over time.\n\nI guess the important thing is that it doesn't seem like we're fundamentally ruling out the possibility of having a standardized libcore if we go this route. We are committing however to either having libstd get the benefit of inherent methods on scalar types while others don't, or else finding a way to bridge this gap in the future so that multiple sets of inherent methods can co-exist (which is probably going to wind up being somewhat similar to the trait scheme we have now).\n",

This is just a \"purity\" argument in a sense though, ergonomically there's no downside either way.\n\n> But we might also consider whether we want to integrate inherent methods into the trait system somehow so that it is possible to have multiple sets of \"inherent\" methods (and perhaps one must somehow pick-and-choose which one to use?). Variations on this theme have been requested over time.\n\nThis is a very good point! One I had not considered much. It does indicate to me that my perceived \"impurity\" here may not actually be so impure in the long run (in which case I'm running out of arguments!).\n\n> I guess the important thing is that it doesn't seem like we're fundamentally ruling out the possibility of having a standardized libcore if we go this route.

    "body": "@SimonSapin To expand on @aturon's answer: it's done with `#[lang=...]` on the impls themselves.\nAny lang item can be defined at most once in a crate hierarchy, and libstd (and all of its constituents, behind the facade) \"happens\" to have _all_ the lang items taken for itself.\n\nThat means _no_ crate using libstd can add methods to any of the primitives supporting this mechanism.\nHowever, crates depending on _only_ libcore can implement any of the lang items that are not in libcore (e.g. the ones for `char` and `str`).\n",
