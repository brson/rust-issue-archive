    "body": "> If I understood you correctly, you were referring to module bar not being at the top level and still being usable within a use declaration\n\nYes; any module in the module hierarchy can appear in a use declaration, as long as you've got the full path to it (or use `self` or `super` to abbreviate it/avoid privacy issues).\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, I still don't think this is correct, since the following is fine:\n\n``` rust\nmod foo {\n    extern mod extra;\n    use self::extra::ringbuf;\n}\n\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nI think the \"correct\" documentation would be to mention `self` (and `super`) and make a special mention of `extern mod` (possibly even with a few examples) since this comes up so much.\n\n`self` and `super` make the import no longer from the crate root: `use self::...` imports with the path starting from the current module, `use super::...` imports with the path starting from the direct parent of the current module.\n",
