    "body": "As for the syntax stuff, I'm all for removing all the obsolete syntax. 2 questions about it though:\n1. If we're removing the obsolete warning for `const`, are we still intentionally keeping it around as a keyword? If so, could we move it into the `'reserved` section of the keywords list? I'm unclear as to whether we have any flexibility in reordering that list.\n2. In the parser, right after the obsolete code you removed for `token::AT`, there's the stuff for `token::TILDE`. I haven't checked, we don't literally transform `box foo` into `~foo`, do we? Assuming we don't, then we should probably officially obsolete the `~[1,2,3]` syntax (which we currently still accept, but which should be replaced with `box [1,2,3]`).\n",

    "body": "I guess we didn't start actually using `#[deprecated]` until very recently, so we have a bunch of post-0.10 changes that don't have nice deprecations anyway.\n\nGiven that, I suppose it's ok to go ahead and remove this stuff. We're also going to have to remove all deprecations before minting 1.0 anyway, so it's not like people can expect to go from point-release to point-release and get proper deprecations (which is to say, anyone moving from whatever our final point-release is to 1.0 will not get any deprecations anyway).\n\nAnd since your goal here is to remove warnings, while I'd like to see `~[1,2,3]` made obsolete, that is perhaps more suitable for a separate PR.\n",
