    "body": "I'll note that this is very much a break-the-world change due to the new restrictions being placed on statics. I don't really know a great way to provide a smooth path forward in all respects, so I didn't put forth any effort in this patch for a deprecation path.\n\nI'll also note that this implements a [clarified version of the RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/362) which may be surprising at first. The PR description/commit messages should have the info though.\n\nI'm always open to suggestions for more tests, I tried to write a test for everything I could think of along the way, but I surely missed something here or there!\n",
