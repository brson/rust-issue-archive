The default 256 limit that command-line programs see isn't set by launchd as far as I can tell, it's either set by Terminal.app or by bash. You can raise it to 10240 with `setrlimit()`, and you can verify this yourself by opening a new Terminal window and typing `ulimit -n 10240`.\n\nI have some proof-of-concept code that calls `sysctl()` to find out the current setting for `kern.maxopenfilesperproc` and then gives this to `setrlimit()`, and it works.\n",
