It will\nbecome sound when `bool` is stored as `i8` but always used as `i1`.\n\nHowever, the current behaviour will always be identical to `x & 1 != 0`,\nso there's no need for it. It's also surprising, since `x != 0` is the\nexpected behaviour.\n\nCloses #7311\n\nd0a1176 r=huonw\ne4a76e6 r=thestinger\n",
