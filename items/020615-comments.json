I like this API, but I think we should still have a way to explicitly `detach()` when necessary, because I could imagine edge cases where a program can't decide if it wants to detach until the the thread has already started work.\n\nHere's an example of a toy program that requires this ability:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::thread::Thread;\nuse std::sync::mpsc::channel;\nuse std::rand::{self, Rng};\nuse std::io::timer::sleep;\nuse std::time::duration::Duration;\n\nfn run_thread() {\n    let (tx, rx) = channel();\n    println!(\"running thread\");\n    let guard = Thread::spawn(move || {\n        tx.send(rand::thread_rng().gen_range(0f32, 1f32)).unwrap();\n        println!(\"thread sleeping\");\n        sleep(Duration::seconds(2));\n        println!(\"thread finished sleeping\");\n    });\n    if rx.recv().unwrap() < 0.5 {\n        println!(\"detaching\");\n        guard.detach()\n    } else {\n        println!(\"joining\")\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    run_thread();\n    println!(\"exiting main thread\");\n}\n```\n",

My and @alexcrichton's instinct here is that this is a relatively niche concern that could be relegated to `std::os::thread` (or something like that, details still being worked out) -- a lower-level, cross-platform thread API.\n\nIn any case, these are `#[unstable]` for now so we can revisit during alpha.\n\n@alexcrichton Nits addressed.\n",

    "body": "@pythonesque @sfackler @alexcrichton I talked with some of you all about this on IRC, but: I think a good middle ground here is for the `spawn` and `scoped` methods on the builder to return `Result`s, but on `Thread` (where they are meant as conveniences) to `panic` in these situations.\n\nUsually we avoid such duplication (i.e., no `spawn` and `spawn_result` variants), but here the API is already duplicated for convenience; the builder is a kind of power tool. This seems to strike a good balance between making the common case easy and providing the tools for extra robustness if you want them.\n\nAll that said, I'd like to move forward with this PR as-is since there's a limited window to land these changes before alpha. Since the relevant bits of the API are `#[unstable]`, we can revisit shortly after the alpha release.\n",
