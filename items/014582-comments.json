    "body": "This is a \"feature\" (well, a bug too, but it's well covered elsewhere, e.g. https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6894). Static methods need to be called like `MyTrait::act()`. However, this doesn't allow the `Self` type to be infered correctly. The standard work around is using a dummy parameter that mentions `Self`. e.g.\n\n``` rust\ntrait MyTrait {\n    fn act(_dummy: Option<Self>);\n}\n\nfn act<T: MyTrait>(val: &T) {\n    MyTrait::act(None::<T>); // call T's act method\n}\n```\n\nThis precise behaviour is covered by \"uniform function call syntax\", which is being discussed in RFCs like https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/4.\n\n(Thanks for filing.)\n",
