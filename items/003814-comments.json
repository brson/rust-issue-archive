    "body": "[C++ AMP(Accelerated Massive Parallelism)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++_AMP) was often mentioned. To quote Wikipedia: \"The `restrict(amp)` instructs the compiler to statically check that the function uses only those language features that are supported by most GPUs\". This seems to be a good idea and we should research what the subset is. We can use an attribute to specify restriction. This seems independent of how code generation is done.\n\nTwo possible strategies for code generation is doing it in rustc and doing it in LLVM. Doing it in rustc would need a defined interface to `trans`. @eholk's demo does it in LLVM (but using NVPTX instead of OpenCL). Doing it in LLVM for OpenCL needs emscripten-like decompilation algorithm. Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes implemented this approach in [axtor](https://bitbucket.org/gnarf/axtor). axtor also has GLSL backend and supporting GLSL seems to be a good idea. Most of the work will be shared.\n\nAnother possibility is using SPIR, which is an assembly form of OpenCL so it doesn't need a decompilation. SPIR is based on LLVM IR (which is a plus) and is in the process of being standardized (also a plus). Having to wait for it to be finished should be okay since this is not Rust 1.0 material anyway.\n",
