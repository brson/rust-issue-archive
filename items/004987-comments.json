    "body": "What's the intended use case for fun_treemap? Should it be fully functional? I don't see why that's particularly useful since it cant be shared over task boundaries as @thestinger mentioned in #7212. Purely functional implementations also (I think) require O(log(n)) space overhead per copy, which is a bummer if the use case is to keep tons of generations around. If it's not going to be purely functional, should it be partially consistent or fully consistent? Traditional persistent maps appear to be useful in some computational geometry problems, but I'm not sure if that's really a common enough application to support in `extra`.\n",
