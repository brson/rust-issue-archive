The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@brson SunOS is what is currently returned from `uname -s` on my SmartOS machine that was built September 17, 2015.  `x86_64-sun-solaris` is the recognized LLVM triple.  As much as I'd like to just name everything \"illumos\" or \"smartos\", the underlying \"sunos\" and \"solaris\" terms will probably stick around to confuse people for years to come :smile:  I'll use \"illumos\" for the rest of this comment where possible.\n\nksh93 is the variant that is included with illumos, which shellfire mentions is not supported.  ksh93 _does_ support local variables, but through the use of the [`typeset` command](http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/unix3/korn/ch06_05.htm).\n\nI think it would be cleaner to just have a shell wrapper for `/bin/bash` or `/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/usr/bin/ksh` when illumos is detected, but I noticed in the other issues you were wanting to stress non-bash compliance.\n\nWould adding back the `local` definitions and changing the above shell wrapper to the following work for you?\n\n``` bash\n# /bin/sh on Solaris is not a POSIX compatible shell, but bash is.\nif [ `uname -s` = 'SunOS' -a \"${POSIX_SHELL}\" != \"true\" ]; then\n    POSIX_SHELL=\"true\"\n    export POSIX_SHELL\n    exec /usr/bin/env bash $0 \"$@\"\nfi\nunset POSIX_SHELL # clear it so if we invoke other scripts, they run as bash as well\n```\n",

Even better if anyone has a commercial interest in it. :)\n\nOverall, it seems to me there are more people trying to achieve the same goals, and I think we should consolidate our efforts.\n",

    "body": "@potatosalad I don't think it differs much from other platforms. I use a [NetBSD port](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/28543/files) (+ [another pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26682/files)) as a reference, and here is another resource that I've found: [Cross Bootstrapping Rust](https://kwantam.github.io/Rust_cross_bootstrapping.html).\n\nFor now the progress is blocked by the LLVM bug, but it can be temporarily fixed as described (i.e., by removing the unsupported `discard-unused=sections` linker flag). What remains to be done is a careful comparison and porting of libc structs, functions, and constants, as they're almost entirely different on Solaris. Perhaps this process can be automated, but I do it manually by looking up structs in `/usr/include` on SmartOS. This way I've ported about 30-40% of them, but I've stumbled upon another compilation error, only now it's jemalloc - it's something like\n\n```\nchecking whether a program using ffsl is compilable... no\nconfigure: error: Cannot build without ffsl(3) or __builtin_ffsl()\n```\n\nI haven't made any more progress since then. So, as I see, now there is another spark of interest in the port, so here's my plan:\n1. First, I'm going to try to figure out how the issue with jemalloc can be fixed;\n2. I'll try to get a stage 0 compiler binary for Solaris (it might not be working, but at least it should compile without errors);\n3. I'll push my libc changes and from there on we can proceed to try to bootstrap the compiler and make all the tests green. I think this would be a huge task, so it'd be awesome if anyone is willing to collaborate on this one.\n\nI'll update on the progress in this issue. Any comments? :)\n",

Now compilation proceeds, but there are more errors because of platform-specific code in `libstd` that's yet to be ported.\n\nI'll keep updating.\n",

It's just a copy of `stage2/bin` and `stage2/lib` files (you probably should have GCC 4.8 installed to run this).\n\nSources are here (in the `solaris` branch):\nhttps://github.com/nbaksalyar/rust/tree/solaris\nhttps://github.com/nbaksalyar/rust-libc\n\nIt should compile as-is, you just have to run `configure` with `--enable-local-rust` and `--local-rust-root=<path to a pre-compiled rustc>` flags.\n\nHere's a quick rundown on what's yet to be done:\n- At the moment there's one major blocker preventing a merge with the master branch: the [LLVM linker flags incompatibility](https://www.illumos.org/issues/6509). Hopefully it'll be fixed soon, but at the moment LLVM's `configure` has to be patched.\n- The compiler should be thoroughly tested. I don't have much time to do this, so any help here would be much appreciated!\n- There's a couple of dirty hacks in the ported source that I don't like. In particular, [handling of a `dirent` structure](https://github.com/nbaksalyar/rust/commit/45d1e1e52312268f2731642f3a2211ccd7f8bcba) - it should be rewritten in a more meaningful and clear way.\n- Stack unwind isn't working yet, it has to be debugged and fixed.\n- Cargo has to be ported as well.\n\nOverall, it's not too complex, so I hope that we'll get to rustc being available in pkgsrc soon. :)\n\n@potatosalad \n\n> access to a more powerful machine to speed up compile times, I might be able to help out in that area.\n\nThanks, that would be super useful to have!

Jumping through a hoop to reexecute this script in bash just on Solaris is pretty crazy. I've already converted multirust to bash.\n\n@potatosalad bash is always available on IllumOS? Presumably you are hitting trouble with other scripts that require `sh` as well?\n\nI've filed a new issue about converting sh to bash: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31036.\n",

    "body": "Hi @brson!\n\nI believe `bash` is the primary shell on Illumos-derived operating systems (I'm not sure about Oracle's Solaris, though). It'd be nice if you merge this pull request, as the \"controversial\" configure script is one of the last bits required to add the support for Illumos to Rust. I'm maintaining my fork here: https://github.com/nbaksalyar/rust/commits/solaris.\n\nIt already passes most of the tests (`run-pass`, `run-fail`, and others), so I'm planning to wrap it up and send as a pull request today or tomorrow. The required `libc` changes are already landed: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/libc/pull/138. I hope it's OK to choose you as a reviewer.\n\nSo it would be awesome to have this PR merged first. :)\n",
