    "body": "This issue/feature is now entering its cycle-long FCP for stabilization in 1.5\n\n---\n\n@brson, we currently have very few undefined symbols actually:\n\n```\n$ nm -u libcore*\n\ncore-10cbabc2.0.o:\n                 U fmod\n                 U fmodf\n                 U memcmp\n                 U memcpy\n                 U memset\n                 U __powidf2\n                 U __powisf2\n                 U rust_begin_unwind\n                 U rust_eh_personality\n```\n\nOf these, `rust_begin_unwind` and `rust_eh_personality` are verified by the compiler to exist in the form of a lang item (e.g. it's unstable to define them) whenever you're producing a staticlib, executable, or dylib, so we're covered on that front. The `memcmp`, `memcpy`, and `memset` functions are lowered to by LLVM and I think it's safe to say that our reliance on their meaning will never cause breakage. The `__powi{d,s}f2` function dependencies [may disappear](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/28611) but otherwise they're provided by compiler-rt so I don't think we have to worry about them.\n\nOtherwise, the only symbols we rely on are `fmod` and `fmodf` and that in turn is only because `Div` and `Rem` must be implemented in libcore instead of being able to define them in libstd for floats. I'm personally comfortable with this because `--gc-sections` makes the dependency go away and the symbols also have very well known meanings.\n\nDo you have further concerns in light of this information?\n",

    "body": "Some things I noticed when I worked on adapting [_ring_](https://briansmith.org/rustdoc/ring/) to work with `#![no_std]` and libcore:\n\nI don't get why I have to use `core::foo` instead of `std::foo`. I ended up having to write things like this:\n\n``` rust\n// Re-export `{mem, ptr}` from either `std` or `core` as appropriate. This\n// keeps the conditional logic on one place.\n#[cfg(feature = \"lib_no_std\")]\npub use core::{mem, ptr};\n#[cfg(not(feature = \"lib_no_std\"))]\npub use std::{mem, ptr};\n```\n\nThen I refer to, e.g. `ring::ffi::mem::uninitialized()` and `ring::ffi::ptr::null()` from all my other modules. But, it doesn't really make sense. I feel like it would be much better to just be able to use `std::ffi::ptr::null()` in `#![no_std]`.\n\nAlso, it is confusing to me about whether `#![no_std]` applies to the entire crate or only to individual modules. Especially when building using Cargo, it isn't clear to me how it is useful to have a mix of `#![no_std]` modules within a single crate.\n\nFinally, the documentation should be clearer about how to write a library that automatically works in both `#![no_std]`mode and non-`#![no_std]` mode depending on whether the executable is built with or without `#![no_std]`. Right now I have my library crate define a feature that controls whether or not I enable `#![no_std]` in the library, but it would be nice if it were automatic.\n",

In that sense, it sounds like a number of concerns you have would be addressed?\n\nPart of the pain of using `#![no_std]` today is that if you want to work on both stable and nightly Rust you've got this whole import and duality problem, but that's why I'd like to stabilize `#![no_std]` :).\n\nAdditionally, `#![no_std]` is only a crate level attribute (which the docs should explain), so there's actually no notion of a \"no_std module\" vs another module as a whole crate should behave the same way.\n\nDoes that help explain things? I can try to bolster up our docs on this subject before we push this over the finish line!\n",

    "body": "> Why is core only implicitly imported when we use `#![no_std]`?\n\nAt 1.0 we didn't inject the `core` library, and it would be a breaking change to do so now. Additionally I would personally not want it injected by default as std is \"The Standard Library\" which should be ubiquitously used instead of a mixture of core/std in my opinion. I would see it as a failure mode if a style guideline existed where in normal Rust code one should use `core::foo` for imports from core and `std::foo` for std-only imports.\n\n> Are you planning to update the documentation to use core:: ubiquitously?\n\nNot currently, the documentation for `#![no_std]` would indicate that `core` is simply a subset of the standard library, so if a code example will work with only libcore it'll work by just rewriting std to core imports.\n\n> It is confusing to have two sets of names for the same things.\n\nI think this confusion primarily stems from a lack of documentation. I think it's crucial to maintain the distinction of whether code is in a \"core only\" or \"std only\" context. It's important to know what abilities you have access to (e.g. can you do I/O?). Beyond that the structures are exactly the same, so once this piece of information is known I don't think it'll be too confusing (but it definitely needs to be explained!)\n\n> Do I have to worry that there will be code duplication between the core:: and :std:: variants of features?\n\nThat's actually the great part! Because the standard library simply reexports everything from core, a `#![no_std]` crate can still be used with any other crate seamlessly, there won't be any duplication of anything.\n",

    "body": "I am surprised that it is so difficult to convey how confusing this is.\n- Why should the Rust programmer have to wonder whether `core::foo` is the same as `std::foo` or not?\n- Why should the default be to write code that is incompatible with `#![no_std]`? In particular, let's say a library only uses features of `std` that are also in `core`. Why should that library be fail to work in a `#![no_std]` executable?\n- Why does the documentation recommend coding patterns (using `std::` instead of `core::`) that don't work ubiquitously?\n- Why does Rust have an elaborate style guide about how to format and organize code, but not have canonical names for the most core library features, thus making it impossible to write code in a canonical form that works ubiquitously?\n\nIMO, it would make a lot more sense to NOT have `#![no_std]` and instead have `#![feature(no_std)]` that disables everything in `std::` that requires runtime support, and then deprecate `core::`. This would be more consistent with how other sets of features within `std::` are enabled/disabled and would allow every library feature to have one, canonical, ubiquitous, name.\n",

    "body": "Here is the development mode that I see for libcore compatible libraries on crates.io:\n1. Somebody makes a library that isn't libcore-compatible.\n2. Somebody else that needs the library to be libcore-compatible submits pull requests to make it libcore-compatible so they can use it in their no_std projects.\n\nStep #2 will likely involve making some features of the third-party library conditional on whether `std` is being used or whether `core` is being used. Note that it isn't clear how how this conditional enablement of features should work. In particular, which `#![cfg(feature = \"???\")]` should be used? In my suggestion above, this would be `#![cfg(feature = \"no_std\")]`.\n\nStep #2 will also likely involve changing some `std::` references to `core::` references. According to [the Drawbacks section of the RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1184-stabilize-no_std.md#drawbacks), this is likely to be an source-copmatible-breaking change in the library. For example, if the library exports macros that reference `std::` and those changes are changed to `core::`. This would put the third-party library developers in a Catch-22: they either has to choose between backward-compatibility or libcore compatibility. In my suggestion above, this would not be an issue because there would be no separate `core::`.\n",

    "body": "`core` and `std` are crates that can be used from other crates with `extern crate core;` or `extern crate std;`, just like [`ring`](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/master/src/lib.rs) is a crate that can be used with [`extern crate ring`](https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/blob/819a053456ced9a9599d9736accd1a86718a40ec/src/webpki.rs#L15). The only thing that makes them special is that, by default, the compiler implicitly injects `extern crate std;` at the top of every crate and `use std::prelude::v1::*;` at the top of every module and every crate. `#![no_std]` inhibits this injection. [The plan](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1184-stabilize-no_std.md#no_std) is that `extern crate core;` and `use core::prelude::v1::*;` are injected _instead_, but I don\u2019t know if that part is implemented yet.\n\nSo `#![no_std]` only influences which crates are used. It can not influence what\u2019s in these crates, that would require re-compiling these crates. We could have two different crates that are both called `std`, one of which only includes the core functionality, and use `rustc --extern std=some/thing.rlib` to disambiguate\u2026 I don\u2019t have a opinion on whether this would be a good idea.\n\nThere is no such thing as a `#![no_std]` executable, only `#![no_std]` crates. Each crate has a number of dependencies, which may or may not (implicitly) include `std`. An executable links the union of all recursive dependencies. It can mix crates that use `#![no_std]` and crates that don\u2019t. In that case `std` will be linked.\n\n`std` has [a number of `pub use` statements](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5ca60d94316bd56f412ef4c13292237e206babf1/src/libstd/lib.rs#L284-L314) that \u201creexport\u201d items defined in its own dependencies. These items are not duplicated, just given an (additional) other name. An executable that links `std` also links `std`\u2019s own dependencies.\n",

    "body": "@briansmith \n\nThese are all good questions.\n\nI think a lot of the friction here is due to the [std facade](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/40), which proposed making the standard library largely a shim over a bunch of smaller crates. (Over time, we've scaled this design back significantly.)\n\nThe idea with the facade is that for the common case -- when you're using Rust in user space -- you get a simple, monolithic API surface. In particular, some of the modules that `std` exports are _not_ straight re-exports of `core`, but include more functionality.\n\nAn alternative would have been to not have `std` at all, and instead ship with a set of crates (libcore, libcollections, libio, etc) some of which work in kernel space. That would effectively make things \"no_std by default\". Personally, I regret not pushing harder on that alternative, but doing that now would be a massive breaking change.\n\nBut given that `std` is stable, what can we do today?\n- We could expose `core` unconditionally and try to address the macro issues. Ultimately, this might lead in the direction of favoring `core` imports over `std` imports by default, but that leaves us in a pretty messy position imo (with reexports in `std` that are not recommended for use).\n- Ooh, I just saw @SimonSapin's suggestion: \n\n> We could have two different crates that are both called std, one of which only includes the core functionality, and use rustc --extern std=some/thing.rlib to disambiguate\u2026 I don\u2019t have a opinion on whether this would be a good idea.\n\nI actually think we should strongly consider such a direction. Part of the pre-stabilization work was to ensure that the module structure in `core` matched `std`. We'd probably need to do a bit more work to make sure they are in proper alignment, but the idea that, with a flip of a switch, you get something just like `std` but with no features that depend on system services... seems rather appealing to me. Certainly it would make migrating to \"`no_std`\" (which we'd want to rename...) trivial, modulo not actually depending on extra `std` features.\n",

I mean, if `std` sometimes is the current `std` and sometimes `core`... hmm. :smile: It doesn't sound entirely optimal; it sounds like it _could_ look confusing.\n\n**But** I do agree that it will probably have massive advantages to people developing crates. The risk that someone makes stuff that only works with `std` and not with `core` even though it doesn't _depend_ on any `std`-only features would be much smaller; making a crate that works in both \"standalone\" and \"regular\" modes is merely a matter of \"not depending on extra std features\" like you put it.\n",

I think if we went this direction, we'd want to take steps to _guarantee_ that the \"core version\" of `std` is always a subset of the \"full version\".\n\nThat said, this isn't _so_ different from the situation in the `std::os::*` modules, for example -- where even the _existence_ of a given module in that part of the tree depends on what platform you're on. This is basically saying that `std` is conditionally compiled in two ways, with one API a subset of the other. This kind of thing also happens in the Cargo universe due to [`features`](http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html#the-features-section).\n\nI also think that the majority of users wouldn't need to ever think about this -- that's part of the goal here, after all. And I think the reason is exactly as you spelled out; it's just a simple toggle.\n",

    "body": "@briansmith \n\n> I am surprised that it is so difficult to convey how confusing this is.\n\nI'm sorry you feel this way, but the current design of libcore/libstd has been around for quite some time now and I'm trying to tease apart concerns that exist from a lack of documentation (which there is a sore need for in this area!) and those which are architectural.\n\n@SimonSapin has an excellent explanation as to the current state of affairs in terms of technical details, and [the plan he mentioned](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1184-stabilize-no_std.md#no_std) is indeed implemented. The key aspect of this is that there is zero duplication among libcore and libstd. Large parts of libstd are simply reexports of libcore, so libraries using one can easily interoperate with another.\n\n---\n\n@aturon, @SimonSapin, @perlun \n\nIt's certainly been considered in the past that `std` just has a different meaning in a `#![no_std]` context, but I am personally not a fan of this behavior because I fear that it ends up being confusing when you're looking at a module to know whether it's a \"std module\" or a \"no_std module\". By having two separate names for this concept, `std` and `core`, it's clear what's what and where any snippet of code is expected to work.\n\nThere are also many technical details which simply naturally entail us having two libraries. For example the compiler doesn't auto-inject any `--extern` flags, it'd be difficult having two binaries on the filesystem which are both \"libstd-like\", and it'd be interesting to see how the standard library itself would be interested in terms of linking to a \"lower libstd\". These sorts of things would want to be ironed out, but it seems better to me to stay within the same world we have today of linking, building, and naming libstd.\n\n---\n\n@briansmith \n\nI think your example may not quite be as dire of a situation as it may seem, for example @petrochenkov has what I think is the right idea to have features which bring in std + more functionality. For example:\n\n``` rust\n// src/lib.rs\n#![no_std]\n#[cfg(feature = \"foo\")]\nextern crate std;\n\nuse core::{ ... };\n\n#[cfg(feature = \"foo\")]\nmod foo;\n\n// src/foo.rs\n\nuse std::prelude::v1::*;\n\n// .. code using libstd\n```\n\nIn a world like this, once a library is `#![no_std]` it's _always_ `no_std` (e.g. nothing conditional). When features are added which require the standard library they they can selectively link to and import the standard library in the modules that are implementing that functionality. There's certainly still a problem with macros, but that's a known deficiency of macros which I don't personally believe justifies a redesign of libcore/libstd to have the two named the same.\n\nNote that this is of course only one method of encoding this sort of pattern, I expect more to arise! I think, however, that having a no_std-but-still-with-some-std-features library may not incur quite the annotation burden overhead you may be thinking.\n",

    "body": "> It's certainly been considered in the past that std just has a different meaning in a #![no_std] context, but I am personally not a fan of this behavior because I fear that it ends up being confusing when you're looking at a module to know whether it's a \"std module\" or a \"no_std module\". By having two separate names for this concept, std and core, it's clear what's what and where any snippet of code is expected to work.\n\nAs somebody building stuff for no_std, in particular building libraries and services in Rust for microcontrollers with and without operating systems, I would say that the thing you are optimizing for isn't very useful. I can easily just build the code for a target that is missing some features and find out what features that code really needs, just like I do in C and C++. And, the cost of making no_std mode so different from std mode is very painful. Note that C and C++ don't force the programmer to learn two same-but-different APIs when targeting subsets. In general, the POSIX model of subsetting works well and IMO that is what programmers are expecting.\n\nAnyway, while working on some stuff this weekend, I came across another problem that the current RFC does not address, AFAICT: Although I want my library to be `#![no_std]`, I don't want the tests sub-modules of my library to be `#![no_std]`. In particular, my tests require `Vec` and `HashMap`. So, there needs to be some way of doing this:\n\n``` Rust\n#![no_std]\n....\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    #![no_std + liballoc]\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nI would also like to point out that many applications and libraries for embedded will require #![no_std] + liballoc, some will require #![no_std] + liballoc + threads, some will require #![no_std] + a clock that can return the current time, etc.\n\nAlso, AFAICT, there needs to be some way to tell the compiler to avoid generating the unwinding code to reduce code size when panic! is implemented to just reset the device instead of unwind.\n\nRegarding injecting `use core as std`, that seems like a big improvement to the proposal. However, either way, the documentation at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ should be updated to indicate which features are in core and which aren't. In particular, there shouldn't be separate documentation at https://doc.rust-lang.org/core. In general, anything that exposes libcore as a separate entity to developers, except the developers of the standard library, seems like an indication of something going wrong.\n",

    "body": "@aturon \n\n> Can you spell out in more detail what precise confusion you're worried about, given the above?\n\nCertainly! To be clear, I'm also always under the assumption that libcore is simply a subset of libstd, I don't think there's any core-specific functionality we'll want to have and certainly no core-specific structure. \n\nHere's some failure scenarios of \"no_std == just a subset of libstd\" that I'm worried about:\n- When reading code, I no longer know whether it's intended to be no_std or not. This means that by default I don't know if I have access to utilities like `Vec`, `String`, `println!`, etc. I can check the top of the crate or just run the compiler to figure it out, but I believe that writing code against libcore instead of libstd is a different mode of thinking and having `core` vs `std` is a great way to indicate that.\n- Given an arbitrary snippet of code, the likelihood that it is copy/pastable into my no_std crate (even if `core` is aliased as `std`) I believe to be very small. Usage of libstd utilities for things like allocation, etc, are quite common and will take effort to extract out. I want to make no_std code as frictionless as possible, but it is inherently not an easy thing to do because of how many assumptions you're not allowed to make (e.g. an allocator or I/O).\n- If we name libcore/libstd the same, then I share @perlun's worry that this is the same name for two different concepts. All of a sudden we may have to colloquially start talking about \"core std\" and \"real std\" to differentiate the two. This also brings in all the technical worries I had above to which I'll also add documentation (e.g. two copies of documentation, one a subset of the other, both named the same).\n- If both core and std are named the same, it's hard to contain the \"std features\" of a crate. For example today I can explicitly name both std and core, so I know exactly what modules have access to std and which don't, but if these are named the same then I either have one or the other. Without the ability to name both in source code it may be difficult to have optional features in crates.\n- I'm not personally convinced that there's much of an advantage to be had of no_std just giving you a subset of std. Like the code snippet above, I doubt that there are many crates in existence which can just flip a switch to start working with just libcore, and once you've committed to some changes I would much rather you _explicitly_ add support than just stumble into it and then receive bug reports after the fact when you accidentally use a real-std-only feature.\n\nDoes that help clarify what I'm thinking? \n\nTo expand a little more perhaps without examples, the code which I envision targeting libcore feels different enough than code targeting libstd that I don't think it makes sense to unify the two. I certainly want to make porting code to libcore easy, but I don't think std vs core in terms of naming is ever going to be the most painful part of doing this. I think that effort will _always_ be required to make existing code core-compatible (e.g. structurally or API-wise) and that will always dwarf any amount of sed required to rename imports.\n\nI certainly sympathize with trying to make everything \"Just Work\" as much as possible all the time, but this to me feels like a situation that the libcore/libstd distinction is worth it. If you want to port and truly are using \"just the right subset\" of libstd, then it's trivial to port with some renamings. The trick @petrochenkov could indeed be used to have a \"minimal patch\", but for the reasons above I wouldn't want to do it by default.\n\n---\n\n> I came across another problem that the current RFC does not address, AFAICT: Although I want my library to be #![no_std], I don't want the tests sub-modules of my library to be #![no_std].\n\nYou may want to explore the Rust source tree for examples of how to manage crates with `#![no_std]` (as all the facade crates have to deal with this). I'd also encourage taking a look at `rustc --pretty expanded` even for the standard library, because it turns out that \"using std\" is actually quite low overhead and very simple to enable. These may help show how to compose examples together and existing tools to work with situations like this. And of course, these are definitely the sorts of areas that we likely need better documentation on!\n\nFor example your library could be structured like:\n\n``` rust\n#![no_std]\n#[cfg(test)]\nextern crate std;\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use std::prelude::v1::*;\n\n    // all tests have access to libstd via the prelude + specific imports\n}\n```\n\nWhen using `libtest` you're already required to have the standard library anyway (as libtest links to it) so it should be fine to just go ahead and use all the features of libstd.\n\n> Also, AFAICT, there needs to be some way to tell the compiler to avoid generating the unwinding code to reduce code size when panic! is implemented to just reset the device instead of unwind.\n\nI agree! If possible, though, I'd prefer to keep this issue focused on just libcore. For now, however, you can get away with `-Z no-landing-pads` which should disable generation of unwinding code.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton \n\nThanks, that was a helpful clarification! **TLDR**: I think you raise legitimate points, but think they are outweighed by the benefit of simple porting and familiarity.\n\nLet me briefly go point-by-point.\n\n> When reading code, I no longer know whether it's intended to be no_std or not.\n\nVery true, and in some sense, that's part of the point here. I think it's fair to say that we're trading off local clarity (as you're talking about here) with ease of porting code that fits in core's footprint.\n\nAlso, note that unless you've memorized what `libcore` provides, you're going to be leaning on the compiler to tell you what's available anyway. And I suspect that once you realize a crate is trying to be `no_std` compatible, you'll stop reaching for anything that allocates quickly.\n\nIt'd be easy to signal `no_std` more loudly as well, e.g. via a crates.io badge.\n\n> Given an arbitrary snippet of code, the likelihood that it is copy/pastable into my no_std crate (even if core is aliased as std) I believe to be very small. \n\nThis is absolutely true! However, that's _even more true_ with the status quo, as most code will be using `std` directly. Today, to figure out if I can copy the code in, I have to go through the effort of renaming to `core` etc before I can try it.\n\nI think what you might be getting at here, though, is a different version of your first point: if the code is using `core` then I immediately know I can copy it in. But by the same token, if I'm bringing in code from a `no_std` crate I know I'm good to go.\n\n> If we name libcore/libstd the same, then I share @perlun's worry that this is the same name for two different concepts.\n\nAs I wrote up-thread, this is a legitimate worry, but I think it's largely ameliorated by ensuring \"core std\" is a true subset of \"std\". I think it's a pretty easy concept to get your head around, and I also think a large part of the ecosystem won't even have to (allocation's pretty common, after all...)\n\nTo be honest, I think it's easier to understand this design than to grasp that `std` is actually a facade.\n\n> If both core and std are named the same, it's hard to contain the \"std features\" of a crate.  ... Without the ability to name both in source code it may be difficult to have optional features in crates.\n\nPresumably in the case you're imagining, the optional feature also selects which version of std you're linking to? ISTM that the compiler would then help you ensure you're staying in the right footprint? But I could be missing something.\n\n> I'm not personally convinced that there's much of an advantage to be had of no_std just giving you a subset of std. ... I would much rather you explicitly add support than just stumble into it and then receive bug reports after the fact when you accidentally use a real-std-only feature.\n\nI was imagining the workflow here would be that you would opt in to no_std if/when a downstream customer wanted to rely on it, so there's no chance of bug reports as long as you successfully compile.\n\n> To expand a little more perhaps without examples, the code which I envision targeting libcore feels different enough than code targeting libstd that I don't think it makes sense to unify the two. I think that effort will always be required to make existing code core-compatible (e.g. structurally or API-wise) and that will always dwarf any amount of sed required to rename imports.\n\nI agree that no_std is a different world, but (your points above aside) see no reason to _add_ friction to living in that world. Ideally, we would foster a thriving no_std ecosystem, and it's not unthinkable for such crates to be used in crates that otherwise use std. Being able to dive into that world and see familiar `std` imports seems to reduce, even if in a tiny way, the friction involved.\n",

    "body": "I feel that I need to comment here, not to downplay any of @briansmith's concerns, but to provide an opposing viewpoint with my own experience. I have been using no_std extensively, including one library that has been made available on crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/fixedvec. I have found the core vs std split to be ideal, as it clearly lays out what functionality I have available. I search the rustdoc for 'core::foo' and can get the libcore API for foo. I have never had a problem running code I've written to use no_std in a \"full std\" environment.\n\nTesting has not been a problem either. I simply add:\n\n``` rust\n#[cfg(test)]\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate std\n```\n\nat the top of the file and then\n\n``` rust\nuse std::prelude::v1::*;\n```\n\nto my test module.\n\nMy biggest difficulties have been around the Cargo support for no_std, not libcore itself. Right now there is not a way to search/filter libraries that are allocation-free. I've added a variety of keywords to my own crate to try and indicate that it uses only libcore, but an official marker of some sort would be fantastic.\n",

    "body": "**TL;DR:** Wherein Niko begins as unsure, but gradually convinces himself that subsets of libstd is a promising model, and may perhaps solve some other concerns as well.\n\nSo I've just been catching up on this thread. With respect to what is more confusing, it is always hard to separate out the effects of lack of documentation, of course, but I also think it's interesting that both of these designs wind up (in a way) with two names for the same thing:\n- under the facade, you have distinct names for `core` and `std`, but that leads in turn to distinct names for all common functionality. That is, you have `core::foo` and `std::foo` which are, in fact, equivalent. So when you see a stackoverflow question talking about `core::foo` (posted, perhaps, by some new user that works in a  shop where they write `no_std` crates), you have to mentally translate to know that it is the same question as one that talks about `std::foo`.\n- on the other hand, under the \"subset std\" design, you have in fact distinct subsets of std that need to be named. Thus when you see some stackoverflow question that refers you to use `std::foo`, you have to mentally check whether that is part of your subset.\n\nWriting it out that way, I have to admit that I agree that the \"subset std\" approach feels overall less confusing. After all, I must always check whether the suggested functions belong to my subset, but at least this way I can do that by just copy-and-pasting the code, and without the need to switch from `core` to `std`. Moreover, while it is true that one will colloquially have to clarify which subset of std you are using, I feel like that is already the case. That is, you won't say \"I'm using 'core std'\" or \"'real std'\", you will say \"I'm using the core subset\" or \"I'm using the alloc subset\" (presumably we'll have named subsets roughly corresponding to the existing facade). \n\nSome things get a lot nicer in this model (imo). For example, the inherent methods on primitive types can now be cleanly shared. Some other things seem to get more complicated. For example, I do not know how this interacts with @alexcrichton's \"swappable allocator crate\" design -- I guess that `liballoc` wants (at least) to remain a distinct crate. This is probably OK because I don't think it shares much surface area with `libstd` (if any).\n\n**However,** what I find interesting here is that this really sounds to me like a kind of lint, or perhaps an additional feature of some kind. That is, you want a way to declare what subset of libstd you are intending to use, and you want to get warnings (or errors) when you stray from that subset _even if your current target happens to support something larger_. Having end-users employ `#[cfg]` switches doesn't feel like quite the right solution to me, because it is likely to lead to pull requests that accidentally add inappropriate dependencies. These errors would not be detected until the tests are run on the full suite of configurations. \n\nInterestingly, this starts to sound a lot like the desire which many have to straddle Rust versions. That is, I might like to restrict myself to the subset of std that was available in Rust 1.5, even while maintaining forwards compatibility with Rust 1.6, 1.7, and so forth. Currently we don't really have a good way to do this, except for building with all three versions of Rust (and of course there's a question about how to manage deprecation, but that's an orthogonal concern, I think). \n\nFinally, I think that this idea of wanting to limit oneself to subsets is not limited to libstd, of course. It applies to every library. After all, if I'm building on @briansmith's library, which offers limited functionality for more limited targets, I may also want to be able to ensure that I don't lean on functionality outside of that subset.\n\nSo I feel torn. On the one hand, I think introducing some notion of named subsets of std is a promising way of thinking about things. On the other hand, it sounds like something that will take some design work to get right, so it would clearly be some time before we could stabilize `no_std` (or whatever it's equivalent becomes).\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton \n\n> There are also many technical details which simply naturally entail us having two libraries. For example the compiler doesn't auto-inject any --extern flags, it'd be difficult having two binaries on the filesystem which are both \"libstd-like\", and it'd be interesting to see how the standard library itself would be interested in terms of linking to a \"lower libstd\". These sorts of things would want to be ironed out, but it seems better to me to stay within the same world we have today of linking, building, and naming libstd.\n\nI don't know if things have to be this complicated. The way I see it, any given system would only have one libstd, but libraries would use lints to restrict themselves from using features that may not be available on all platforms of interest. So there would not be a need for two binaries that are \"libstd-like\", just one.\n",

In principle, this is sufficient for our purposes, but it doesn't give a good user experience -- you'd like to be able to build for one target and have some reasonable confidence that this code will work on all targets (obviously this cannot be guaranteed in the limit, but it's nice for it to be \"as true as possible\"). This is why having some sort of lint that lets you say \"in this module, I intend to stick to the core subset\" would be helpful. Does that make sense?\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the comments everyone! I had a long discussion with @aturon last night as well, and I wanted to explain one of the key things I remembered as part of that.\n\nOne of the hard design constraints to me here is that crates build for `no_std` _must_ be able to interoperate with crates that use \"regular std\". This prevents splits in the ecosystem and enables a great deal of reuse which I think is quite important. This also has the nice property of enabling things like custom allocators written in Rust where the allocator is `no_std` (because std needs an allocator and circular deps are bad), but then another crate can explicitly depend on that allocator and std and everything will \"just work\" because all the types match up.\n\nSo, given that, I think it may be useful to explore some technical aspects of the implementation to see what a \"std subset\" design might look like. I think this is useful to both see what some limitations might be as well as having a good handle on what it would look like to perhaps find some possible drawbacks.\n\nFirst, I think that simply compiling std twice with different profiles won't work unfortunately. If the \"real std\" doesn't link to the \"core std\" then the types won't be shared and they won't interoperate. Even in terms of ABI the symbols among the two libraries will be quite different (a technical hurdle which may in theory be overcomable, though). Given that, at least in today's world, the way that this would work is that the \"real std\" and the \"core std\" would be two separate crates (e.g. like libstd and libcore today).\n\nNow that we've got two crates, it's possible to do what @petrochenkov mentioned which is to have the compiler simply inject `extern crate foo as std` and then you have some attribute to decide what `foo` is (and it's \"std\" by default). We would do our due diligence and ensure that core is a subset of std at all times, and then we'd presumably have two (disconnected?) forms of documentation generated via rustdoc hosted to explore the two libraries.\n\nWith this setup, let's explore how we might evolve the no_std story over time. Let's say in the future that we want to stabilize more subsets of std, such as \"std with only an allocator\". The way we'd implement this (given what I mentioned above), is to have a crate in our distribution, say `alloc`, and structure it in the same way as the rest of std except add on modules and functionality that require allocation (e.g. collections, smart pointers, etc). This seems relatively straightforward to me! Now if we keep going and we want to stabilize a whole lot of subsets then in theory each subset may not be a strict superset of what's beneath it. For example maybe it makes sense to have \"core + io\" and \"core + allocator\" be two different subsets of std. If we use crate attributes to control which subset of std you receive, then we'll have to ship a permutation of crates to match each subset you may select. This seems less straightforward than before, but this may also not come up in practice.\n\nThe evolution story to me seems a little cleaner where we have explicit crates that represent what's under std (e.g. A + B == \"extern crate A; extern crate B;\") and may provide us more flexibility with adding \"std subsets\" in the future.\n\nI think if we stop at \"core std\" and \"real std\" and don't go much farther then the concern about evolution isn't that pressing. If we still commit to multiple crates though it may not \"magically fix\" (as I wish it would) problems like inherent impls or duplicated documentation, we'd still have work to do on those fronts.\n\nSo given all that, what do others think? Do you agree that a \"subset std\" approach requires multiple crates? Do you think the evolution story is a non-concern?\n\n---\n\n@aturon \n\nI think I agree with you that if the only reason for `core` to exist was to give an explicit name to a subset of std then it wouldn't be worth sacrificing the ease of porting and familiarity. Some of the technical concerns I've had, however, I think may still tip my opinion in favor of sticking with core + std. I'm sorry I'm a bit scatterbrained though! I'm curious to hear your thoughts on what's above, though. For some of the other points you made:\n\n> To be honest, I think it's easier to understand this design than to grasp that std is actually a facade.\n\nI think I agree with this, yeah. I unfortunately don't think I've seen anyone who instantly understood that core and std interoperate seamlessly and there always seems to be a fear that one won't work with the other. If everything was named std, however, it may alleviate this concern by only having one library instead of an \"apparent two\".\n\n> ISTM that the compiler would then help you ensure you're staying in the right footprint? But I could be missing something.\n\nAh I was thinking along the lines of `mod foo;` has access to core-only features and `mod bar;` has std features as well (e.g. enabled via a cargo feature flag). The \"compiler helping\" here would be the `foo` module not importing anything from `std` but `bar` would import std's prelude.\n\n> I was imagining the workflow here would be that you would opt in to no_std if/when a downstream customer wanted to rely on it, so there's no chance of bug reports as long as you successfully compile.\n\nAh yeah I'd be more worried in the case where the author didn't actually intend to have `no_std` support (it just accidentally happened), and then downstream authors started relying on that. If the upstream crate then started using `String` it would break everyone downstream without the upstream author being aware (in theory). This isn't a super strong concern, of course, just a failure mode that I'd like to avoid.\n\n> Ideally, we would foster a thriving no_std ecosystem\n\nTo be clear, I totally agree! I think we may just differ on how much we consider \"use core\" vs \"use std\" as friction for entering this ecosystem. I expect this ecosystem to naturally have a high amount of friction simply because it's not \"the default\" (e.g. \"real std\" is the default). Maintaining crates in this ecosystem will also have some degree of tension to provide both features that work everywhere as well as perhaps-more-ergonomic std-only features.\n\nPut another way, in my mind there's N units of inherent friction to be a no_std crate (which of course has quite the payoff to make it worth it!), and the amount of fiction from core vs std I don't see as a large enough portion of N to be too worried about. I could be wrong, however! Maybe there's a scenario where there's 0 friction to be a no_std crate? Perhaps I'm playing \"doomsayer\" too much?\n\n---\n\n@nikomatsakis \n\n> I don't know if things have to be this complicated. The way I see it, any given system would only have one libstd, but libraries would use lints to restrict themselves from using features that may not be available on all platforms of interest. So there would not be a need for two binaries that are \"libstd-like\", just one.\n\nI agree that I may have been too extreme in painting the picture as complicated. I'm curious to explore this idea of a lint, though. I think it would answer \"no\" to \"do we require multiple crates\" above, so it seems like it may assuage some of my concerns!\n\nSo exploring this for a bit, one very nice property that libcore has (which I'd personally like to maintain) is that it can be compiled for basically all targets/platforms/etc (so long as LLVM targets it). If we took the route of \"there is only one true std\" and then a lint basically constraints you to a particular subset, it may make the compilation and/or linkage story for the standard library difficult for some platforms. \n\nFor example, I believe some Rust kernels compile with the `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` target, meaning they'd definitely want a lint to constrain std but they'd have to rely on the linker to strip out everything in std that's \"not part of the profile\". While I think this is technically feasible, I'd be a little wary of relying on it happening automatically.\n\nOn the other hand, if I'm writing a new kernel (say, [redox](https://github.com/jackpot51/redox) perhaps) then when I compile the \"one true std\" I in theory don't even want to compile things like I/O or allocation because they don't exist. We can handle this with `#[cfg]` in the standard library, but that may not be available for a brand-new platform and may be painful to add.\n\nOverall, having a libcore/libstd split does have the benefit of making compilation quite easy. You're basically guaranteed to be able to compile libcore at all if your platform can run any Rust code whatsoever, and if you want to get fancy you can work your way towards std.\n\nDoes that make sense? Perhaps there's a method where the a lint-based and/or \"one true std\" approach wouldn't have this downside?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton \n\nSo I feel like I don't quite understand your questions. Perhaps I did not explain what I have in mind very well. Let me take one more shot at explaining it. Let me also point out that I am partially playing devil's advocate here, the current setup seems quite workable. But there are some places where the facade has made things harder for us: error messages are hard because `pub use`; rustdoc is harder and more complex than it has to be; coherence violations are more problematic than you might hope; inherent impls on primitives are trickier; etc. All of these things to some extent are problems that we might want to solve anyway, but they are exacerbated by the facade. So I'm interested to know if we can find a nice alternative.\n\nAnyway, this is what I was thinking:\n1. We define various subsets of std and use `#[cfg]` to select out what belongs to each subset.\n   - So, for example, there is a \"core\" subset that includes only those things that are presently in libcore.\n   - And there is another subset \"collections\" that includes \"core\" but also the collection types.\n2. When you choose a target from our list of supported targets, that also implies a subset of std. For most \"full-featured\" targets, it would be the full subset, but we might have targets for more restricted modes of operation. For example, a kernel target of some kind that uses only the \"core\" subset of std, or something for embedded platforms. Or maybe this is something you can select orthogonally from the target, doesn't matter. Main point is: it's something that you choose at the time you invoke \"cargo build\" for a specific platform/configuration.\n3. Meanwhile, libraries can declare using an attribute what subset they intend to use. They will receive lint errors if they stray outside this subset. Because this is just a lint, it can be overridden for submodules. For example, I might have submodules that I know are only available on \"normal\" platforms, and those might opt into the full std, but other submodules I want to be portable more widely, which would restrict themselves to the \"core\" subset of std.\n\nNow what I was concerned about was the allocator crate situation. But I was thinking that perhaps this could be resolved via \"forward reference\" to an allocator crate, much as we do today from core to handle unwinding. This seems to fit with our overall model, where we want libraries to be compiled without reference to any particular allocator, and we only pick an allocator at the last second. But we should discuss.\n\nOK, in light of that explanation, let me try to make sure I follow some of your specific comments:\n\n> So exploring this for a bit, one very nice property that libcore has (which I'd personally like to maintain) is that it can be compiled for basically all targets/platforms/etc (so long as LLVM targets it). If we took the route of \"there is only one true std\" and then a lint basically constraints you to a particular subset, it may make the compilation and/or linkage story for the standard library difficult for some platforms. \n\nI don't understand how anything changes here. libstd would have defined subsets, one of which would be equivalent to today's core. So when bringing up a new target, you can choose what subset your target supports, and core would always be supported.\n\n> On the other hand, if I'm writing a new kernel (say, redox perhaps) then when I compile the \"one true std\" I in theory don't even want to compile things like I/O or allocation because they don't exist. We can handle this with #[cfg] in the standard library, but that may not be available for a brand-new platform and may be painful to add.\n\nI think what you are saying is: \"if I am defining a new target, I may have a different subset that I wish to use, and none of the pre-defined subsets may apply\". This is no doubt true, but then this is true of crates too -- I may find that I can use libcore and some portion of libcollections, but not all of it (or whatever). Then I just have to petition to split up libcollections and, in the meantime, reproduce what I need. I would think it'd be the same with named subsets: you would say that \"target XYZ only supports the core subset of libstd\" (the minimal one) and you'd offer additional XYZ libraries to replace what is needed, perhaps eventually tweaking what subset of std is available for XYZ.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the elaboration @nikomatsakis! I think what you're thinking definitely makes more sense to me now. We discussed this yesterday as well, but I think it'd be good to write down some of the points which may be pros/cons as a summary as well:\n- This allows us to truly have \"one std\" as there's literally only one binary with one object file in it. The object file will contain all of std for the target in question. We'd be heavily relying on the linker to GC away unused functions to \"appear like\" the object file contains only what you used.\n- A new scheme will need to be invented to say \"I depend on library X, but I only want features A, B, and C\". This will probably be something connected to the `extern crate` declaration, but the idea is that you need a way of instructing the compiler what subset you want. The compiler would then use the annotated source of X (std in our case) to only expose certain APIs and such as part of the public interface.\n- The \"bad error message\" problem will be solved with this as everything truly lives in one location. Note though that this error message is not unique to the standard library, reexports are used widely throughout the ecosystem so it'd just decrease the severity of the problem, not make it go away.\n- The \"duplicate documentation\" problem will also be solved for the standard library, but it doesn't solve the problem of inlining documentation from other crates and reexporting documentation as this is also a common strategy throughout the ecosystem.\n- This would solve the ecosystem problem of \"I depended on crate Foo with feature A but I can use feature B accidentally\". This is Cargo-specific and I can elaborate more on this if needed, but just pointing out it solves a problem in the ecosystem today!\n- This partly solves the SIMD problem of \"compile all SIMD into std but only expose a little when you link against std\". There'd still be some details to work out here\n- This would introduce a problem of the \"core std\" subset needs to statically be known to not access the \"real std\" subset (e.g. how libcore can't access libstd today).\n\nI think that's all I can remember right now at least! There's definitely quite a few tradeoffs here, but overall I feel that a shift in strategy would simply be moving the needle on a lot of these tradeoffs rather than \"solving a bunch and making few problems\". \n\nThoughts though?\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Thanks for writing that up. I agree it's a pretty accurate\nsummary. I also agree that what I'm proposing is pretty different from\nwhat's there and so while it may solve or ameliorate some problems, it may\nwell bring a few of its own that aren't obvious.\n\n(Still, I do think the existence of \"cargo features\" suggests that people\nin the ecosystem at large don't want to just break things up into lots of\nmicrocrates (or can't do so). After all, why aren't they using facades\ninstead of cargo features? Similarly, platform-specific functionality seems\nto fit into more cleanly into the model I'm talking about.)\n\nOn Thu, Oct 1, 2015 at 12:44 PM, Alex Crichton notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Thanks for the elaboration @nikomatsakis https://github.com/nikomatsakis!\n> I think what you're thinking definitely makes more sense to me now. We\n> discussed this yesterday as well, but I think it'd be good to write down\n> some of the points which may be pros/cons as a summary as well:\n> - This allows us to truly have \"one std\" as there's literally only one\n>   binary with one object file in it. The object file will contain all of std\n>   for the target in question. We'd be heavily relying on the linker to GC\n>   away unused functions to \"appear like\" the object file contains only what\n>   you used.\n> - A new scheme will need to be invented to say \"I depend on library X,\n>   but I only want features A, B, and C\". This will probably be something\n>   connected to the extern crate declaration, but the idea is that you\n>   need a way of instructing the compiler what subset you want. The compiler\n>   would then use the annotated source of X (std in our case) to only expose\n>   certain APIs and such as part of the public interface.\n> - The \"bad error message\" problem will be solved with this as\n>   everything truly lives in one location. Note though that this error message\n>   is not unique to the standard library, reexports are used widely throughout\n>   the ecosystem so it'd just decrease the severity of the problem, not make\n>   it go away.\n> - The \"duplicate documentation\" problem will also be solved for the\n>   standard library, but it doesn't solve the problem of inlining\n>   documentation from other crates and reexporting documentation as this is\n>   also a common strategy throughout the ecosystem.\n> - This would solve the ecosystem problem of \"I depended on crate Foo\n>   with feature A but I can use feature B accidentally\". This is\n>   Cargo-specific and I can elaborate more on this if needed, but just\n>   pointing out it solves a problem in the ecosystem today!\n> - This partly solves the SIMD problem of \"compile all SIMD into std\n>   but only expose a little when you link against std\". There'd still be some\n>   details to work out here\n> - This would introduce a problem of the \"core std\" subset needs to\n>   statically be known to not access the \"real std\" subset (e.g. how libcore\n>   can't access libstd today).\n> \n> I think that's all I can remember right now at least!

    "body": "The libs team discussed this during triage today, and the decision was to re-up this for FCP in the next cycle. The conclusion reached, however, was that it is unlikely to move forward with a different design than today's. The were a few points of rationale for this:\n- The alternate proposals in this thread tend to simply trade one set of problems for another, where none are clearly \"better\" than another. \n- A significant amount of energy would be required to change directions, and if the net number of problems remains the same or increases it's unclear whether that's worth it.\n- We have _a lot_ of experiences with crates today, and know that they work well, so piggy-backing on a known working solution decreases the likelihood of surprises.\n\nIn going through another FCP, however, we'd like to have some more discussion, but focused around either:\n- Stabilizing libcore as-is today.\n- An RFC and/or implementation proposing a concrete alternative.\n\nWe'll be chatting with the lang/core teams (as @nikomatsakis mentioned) over the next few days, and I'll likely post updates after that as well.\n\n---\n\n@briansmith \n\nI personally think it's a bit of a mischaracterization to say that all the feedback here has been left unaddressed. I've tried to always respond to questions and concerns in my comments here, and if I've left anything out it's been purely by mistake!\n\nI [tried to answer your question above](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27701#issuecomment-143798260), but I can try to go into more detail here as well. A no_std library doesn't really have a reason to ever _not_ have the no_std attribute, so in that sense a \"non-no_std mode\" doesn't necessarily exist. If a crate wishes to export functionality that _does_ require std (but conditionally export it) then it can simply conditionally link to std.\n\nCan you elaborate on what you mean by \"source code backward compatibility\"? I'm not entirely sure what constraints this implies. \n\nCurrently, however it hasn't in the past been a design constraint that adding no_std support should be possible with 0 source code modifications, so having a crate start supporting no_std will generally mean:\n1. An attribute is added to the crate.\n2. Imports are renamed to `core` instead of `std`, but this can also be dealt with via `extern crate core as std` in the crate root.\n3. If necessary, functionality requiring std is put behind `#[cfg]` directives, likely exposed via Cargo features.\n\nYou can see an [example of this in action](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf/pull/68) where the `mod std` in this case [wasn't necessary](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf/commit/70f2ed93d2e64b822bf2a23fde0ee848e8785bd1), but highlights how a no_std crate is written to center around `core` rather than `std` in terms of imports. The crate, however, compiles on today's stable release (using std), and it all interoperates together.\n",

    "body": "No idea why GitHub just gave me a notification to this, but very glad it did!\n\nSo to be clear here, I think in any individual crate, it's easy to work around any of the proposals thus far. The import ramification is the strengths and weaknesses of each affect what type of ecosystem arises, the compound effects of nudging users in different directions.\n\nSpecifically I worry about the no_std ecosystem. There's two basic issues here:\n\n---\n\nFirst, is the ability to limit oneself to same set of features and _advertise_ that fact for others in the ecosystem.\n\nWhile @nikomatsakis proposed use of `--target` works very well for specific architectures (naturally), often people want to write portable code intended for a certain \"class\" of architectures,  including architectures/variants that may not exist at the time of development. I'd say the subsets of the creates behind the facade correspond to those classes pretty well. Maybe this a stretch, but if your code just uses core it's probably usable for real-time systems, vs if it uses core+alloc. Code that uses core+alloc on the other is might be good for a kernel (especially if alloc is changed so the allocator can always be chosen explicitly).\n\nThe other side is advertising. Because the no_std community is a small subset, and working in domains that traditionally suck at code reuse / abstraction (sorry...), we have an uphill battle here. Consider this quotes of @nastevens \n\n>  My biggest difficulties have been around the Cargo support for no_std, not libcore itself. Right now there is not a way to search/filter libraries that are allocation-free. I've added a variety of keywords to my own crate to try and indicate that it uses only libcore, but an official marker of some sort would be fantastic.\n\nThe need here is after people have worked carefully limit their dependencies, it would be nice to proudly declare they have done so. Given the small size of the no_std community, this helpful both to get the word out, and even more so to make a library discoverable after any buzz subsided. Not to engage in self promotion, but my currently-in-limbo RFC (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1133) would allow exactly for this.\n\nThe counterargument is that if the intended purpose is saying \"this crate is good for real-time use\", \"this crate is good for kernel use\", why not go after this directly with badges or whatever? Firstly, those are inherently subjective, whereas dependencies are not. Secondly, any concerns beyond \"will this build with my project\" such as time-complexity, space-complexity, interrupt-safety, etc, are things we are currently unable to verify, so claiming them is as bad as a more subjective quality--unverifiable either way. Tracking the dependencies at least captures whether something can be built with one's current project, letting one know definitively if there is a chance these this library can be used and those other properties verified.\n\n---\n\nSecond, is the use of code in ways that the original authors did not anticipate. While the no_std community is a small portion of the overall Rust community, there will be a need/desire to use code not original intended for esoteric platforms. Here is where the std-behind the facade duplication backstabs us, as the only option is send out big, and thus hard to merge, pull requests (e.g. https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/bitflags/pull/1) which basically sed everything.\n\nSome might question whether code unintended for such platforms really is fit for them. But I'd argue it's nice to at least be able to check that fact. Also I am a big believer that the ease of writing good abstractions in Rust will such an unintended fit increasingly common compared to legacy languages. An anecdote: In the past year I've written Haskell that compiles to Verilog and Javascript, two targets that absolutely were not anticipated in 1989. In Haskell's case there are many libraries that are basically nothing but abstractions and work very well for obscure targets. I hope (and no-doubt others fear) that such creates will pop up in Rust, especially post-HKT.\n\nNaturally, the subset plan works better for this--libraries only pay for what they use without any foresight or intervention on part of the developer.\n\n---\n\n> @aturon An alternative would have been to not have std at all, and instead ship with a set of crates (libcore, libcollections, libio, etc) some of which work in kernel space. That would effectively make things \"no_std by default\". Personally, I regret not pushing harder on that alternative, but doing that now would be a massive breaking change.\n\nAmen. This would have been the ideal solution. The first part, including my RFC, we get for free. Also normal users are forced (mua ha ha), to at least recognize when they start making more and more assumptions about the underlying platform, which solves the second. (If they just bulk `extern crate` things they don't need, well that is a much more lightweight PR to send them.)\n\nI have some ideas on how we can get the best of both worlds without breaking changes, but I have some other things to do so I'll leave that for a follow-up post.\n",

    "body": "So to follow up, my tentative proposal is to have our cake and eat it too! Specifically, have the user compile std---wait, this won't be as crazy as it sounds :).\n\nIf we move everything into crates behind the facade, std ought to just be re-exports, and thus compile quickly with a stable compile. Furthermore it would have all the target cfgs to get the subset proposal.\n\nFor bare rustc usage, we'd just allow to link anything in the sysroot. But for Cargo, we can also make Cargofile for std that has all the conditional dependencies so that when cross compiling Cargo knows exactly which crates behind the facade need to be built for the given target.\n\nFor those of us working on esoteric targets, it's probably best to avoid std altogether and just use the crates behind the facade, even if most of std is going to be used. Then you're code is super explicit about what sorts of platform/features it depends on, and where. Additionally with my RFC all that information is reflected in the Cargofile for advertising purposes. Basically, live in a world in which we had taken the \"std is a collection of libraries, not a library\" route.\n\nFor normal users, or those not wanting to wait for all the crates behind the facade to be stabilized, just use std. Because of the subsetting behavior, your code will still be usable by those working behind the facade if you happen to confine yourself to a subset.\n\n[N.B. it would be convenient to, in target CFGs (or something similar to avoid the layer violation) list which crates behind the facade are usable. The purpose of this is a kernel for, e.g., x86-64 should use a custom target so that if they link a library written using std, it won't try to build/use normal std for the library with all the UNIX-dependent features. I don't see this as too much of a burden was one should use a custom target anyways for a bunch of other reasons, just now this becomes essential.]\n",

That way we can keep the `core` crate as a hidden implementation detail.\n\nAbout the split - I think it would be helpful if we also split core into at least `base` (integer types), `panic`, and `float` parts given the exported symbols mentioned earlier in the thread. It seems useful to be able to be without `panic` and `float` when targeting really small processors (e g without floating point support) and with very small memory (no unwind code overhead). Separating the `panic` away might be controversial though, so feel free to disregard if it's too difficult.\n",

    "body": "@Ericson2314\n\n> If we move everything into crates behind the facade, std ought to just be re-exports, and thus compile quickly with a stable compile. Furthermore it would have all the target cfgs to get the subset proposal.\n> \n> For bare rustc usage, we'd just allow to link anything in the sysroot. But for Cargo, we can also make Cargofile for std that has all the conditional dependencies so that when cross compiling Cargo knows exactly which crates behind the facade need to be built for the given target.\n\nWorking in embedded systems (a HUGE market where Rust is desperately needed), a solution like this seems very appealing.  In embedded systems, the  two following environment constitute a majority of the new development work happening:\n1. An embedded Linux environment where use of all of `std` is OK but which requires cross-compilation (usually to ARM).  Use of dynamic memory on these targets is usually considered acceptable but high reliability is still expected.\n2.  An embedded target (e.g. 32-bit ARM Cortex-M MCU) where `no_std` (or a more limited subset of `std`) is required across the board.  The global heap (e.g. traditional dynamic memory) should not be used in these environments due to its non-deterministic nature (and memory fragmentation).\n\nThe only way we can currently target these targets right now in systems like zinc is because that framework includes a bunch of hacks for users.  For Rust to gain traction in embedded markets, however, I believe we will need to modify the language ecosystem so that those hacks (and the frameworks implementing them) are not required.  It's hard to make an argument for use of Rust today in these environments (particularly MCUs) given the current state of things.\n\nThe main hacks included in zinc now are the following:\n1. The code running on the target itself does not really include any dependencies outside of the code in zinc itself.\n2. We use [several unstable features right now](https://github.com/hackndev/zinc/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L16).  That is understandable and probably won't change in the short term but something that should be worked toward.\n3. To include core, we use https://github.com/hackndev/rust-libcore\n4. We use rlibc (this is probably OK): https://github.com/hackndev/rlibc.  This wouldn't really be necessary for most embedded targets as we can use something like newlib nano.  For pure rust systems, there are probably some savings with using rlibc.\n\nThings have certainly improved since when everything in Zinc was built using Rakefiles.  I think that cratification and moving toward a `std` facade would solve a lot of problems for less traditional (but critical) environments.\n",

    "body": "@posborne I had talked to you about my RFC long ago, which alone would remove the need for `hackndev/rust-libcore`. I think we are both in agreement that no matter what route is taken, Cargo needs to know about the crates behind the facade / subset of std being used, in order to work well with zinc-like use-cases.\n\nAssume that the build system issue are taken care of either way, and assume also that either the creates behind the facade or equivalent subsets of std can be used or excluded explicitly and portably. Do you prefer a unified namespace, or separate (core, alloc, etc) namespaces, or not really care (those assumptions covering the most important concerns)?\n\nI was thinking that those assumptions cover the most import practical concerns, but that for the zinc crowd at least, the balkanized namespacing itself is valuable as mental reminder of what assumes what. The std namespace would be for those that don't care (and backwards comparability). \n\nConversely, we could keep the crates behind the facade unexposed, and have the std cargofile have explicit features instead of going off the target config. This would basically be @diwic's interface with my implementation, which I think sidesteps @nikomatsakis's concerns. I am not sure what to do for bare `rustc` invocation in that case, but maybe exposing all the flexibility for that is not important as rustc+custom build system already allows one to achieve everything with enough effort.\n",

    "body": "@Ericson2314 \n\nReading over what you're thinking, isn't that basically what the facade is today? It sounds like you'd propose moving out the entire standard library into a facade crate, but we're certainly at liberty to do so today if we like. It also sounds like we're still shipping _some_ binaries, and even if the \"glue of std\" is stable it wouldn't solve the easy-cross-compile problems because you still wouldn't be able to compile the source? (unstable code). Otherwise the facade already buys you the ability to mix and match components underneath the hood, we're able to break apart libraries at will.\n\n---\n\n@diwic \n\nI think what you're proposing is basically the subset proposal on this thread where it takes subslices of std and gives those to you. You can do this with the facade, however, with explicit `extern crate` annotations, you simply just don't access them all through the same `std::` name. In other words, I think that the facade design is not hindering any use cases, it's just a way of expressing each use case.\n\nUnfortunately in the case of splitting core up, support for panicking is required basically everywhere (e.g. `a % b` requires panic support), but if it's a problem in terms of memory usage that's a bug that should be fixed! It is not expected that small embedded contexts will actually have stack unwinders. Additionally floating-point support can just be removed by not using it and then linking with `--gc-sections`. I'd also prefer to move some of it externally, but coherence doesn't allow us to do that right now.\n\n---\n\n@posborne \n\nYou've got some interesting use cases! I think the facade definitely fits in nicely with them, but I'd be curious to hear more about the difficulties you're running into (perhaps elsewhere than this thread), because like you I definitely share enthusiasm for pushing Rust deeply into the embedded space! It sounds like some of your concerns are Zinc-specific or perhaps build-system-related though rather than pertaining to the design of the facade? I'd be curious to dig in more though.\n",

(unstable code).\n\nYes the std-glue doesn't help with cross compiling with a stable compiler. I just wanted to point out that there was no regression; stable not being able to use std would be quite bad :)!\n\nThe big difference is that by using a custom target, one can \"trick\" code using std to just get a portion of std. If the unavailable things were used, well then tough luck, but if they weren't, everything just works. It's sneaky way to allows using normal code in esoteric contexts without modification.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis \n\n> It seems like you shouldn't have to name core, since it contains so much stuff (e.g., the Copy, Sized, and Fn traits) that the compiler relies upon. (Compiling without core, or with a different core, is just not supported.)\n\nThat's fine; the reasons I have it there are:\n1. The RFC mentions a `!#[no_core]`, not mentioning `core` could be the same as specifying no_core in the RFC - at least for now.\n2. We might want to split core even further in the future (e g to split out panic or float handling) - specifying `core` would then suit to do what core does today.\n\n> It'd be sort of nice if #[custom_std] could arrange things such that you still got to just do use std::foo and it worked. Sadly this isn't really possible in any obvious way. That is, you can do extern crate core as std, but if you want routines from alloc you can't \"union\" core and alloc into one \"pseudo-crate\".\n\nI naively thought it would be as simple as autogenerating this code:\n\n```\npub mod std {\n     extern crate core;\n     pub use core::*;\n     extern crate alloc;\n     pub use alloc::*;\n     pub mod prelude {\n        pub use core::prelude::*;\n        pub use alloc::prelude::*;\n     }\n}\n```\n\n...and some compiler magic to make sure `std::prelude` ends up being the prelude?\n",

    "body": "I just figured I'd chime in on @nikomatsakis' bikeshed, and point out that the C/C++ world has long-since had a term for what is currently called `#![no_std]` in Rust: \"freestanding\". In addition, \"freestanding\" has the benefit of being both a \"positive\" notation (avoiding contortions like \"non-`#![no_std]`\" as seen in a message above) and having a natural reading when combined with other things.\n\nFor example, if someone wanted libcore + liballoc, the notation `#![freestanding + alloc]` is immediately obvious as to its meaning, to steal a syntax from an earlier post.\n\nThis would work especially nicely with the above idea of synthesizing `std` rather than injecting an import of it.\n\nOne further thing is that I'm personally not especially convinced by the allocator story as a long-term approach to susbstituting components of std - and I feel that synthesizing `std` offers the opportunity to go one better.\n\nIn particular, `#![freestanding(core, net(lwip))]` could become\n\n``` rust\nmod std {\n     extern crate core;\n     pub use core::*;\n     extern crate lwip as net;\n     pub use net::*;\n     pub mod prelude {\n        pub use core::prelude::*;\n        pub use net::prelude::*;\n     }\n}\n```\n\nHeck, aside from being a shebang, this can be done in a procedural macro (half-pseudocode due to collisions &c):\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! freestanding (\n    ($($component:ident($from:ident)),*) => (\n        mod blarg {\n            $(\n            extern crate $from as $component;\n            pub use $component::*;\n            )*\n            pub mod prelude {\n                $(\n                pub use $component::prelude::v1::*\n                )*\n            }\n        }\n    );\n    ($($c1:ident($i1:ident)),*, $component:ident, $($c2:ident($i2:ident)),*) => (\n        freestanding!( $($c1($i1)),*, $($c2($i2)),*, $component($component) );\n    );\n);\n```\n\nHowever, if implemented in the compiler, it can go further - interpret `#![freestanding(foo)]` as \"I need a foo, but I'm not picky about which one\", enforce that `#![freestanding(bar(baz))]` and `#![freestanding(bar(qux))]` are mutually-exclusive in a similar way to the only-one-allocator linkage rule, etc.\n\nOf course, at that point the names of components behind the facade start looking an awful lot like \"traits for modules\", and `#![freestanding()]` starts to look like a variadic type constructor for implementations of `std`...\n",

If you want core + alloc, why not just say `extern crate alloc` plus the \"only core attribute\"? That way we're not inventing any new attribute and it's just one less thing to remember.\n\nOne benefit could perhaps be the addition of alloc and core both into the prelude, but this sounds a lot like [custom preludes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/890) which may be best to land as an orthogonal feature. Crates elsewhere in the ecosystem want their own custom preludes as well, so it's be good to ensure that there's a unified mechanism everywhere for that.\n",

I worry it will be a leaky abstraction, \n\nI suppose 'synthesized union std module' refers to my proposal...so I just wanted to add that if the leaky abstraction problem is that we have things in (e g) core that should only be used from alloc and not from end-user programs, that can be resolved by making a `for_custom_std` module inside core where you have only the stuff you want to expose to end-user programs, and then have a `pub use core::for_custom_std::*` instead of `pub use core::*`.\n",

    "body": "I'm against stabilizing `#[no_std]` as is. \nMy biggest concerns are:\n1. I compare the `#[no_std]` approach where library and binary authors opt-in to not using the runtime-dependent parts of the standard library to that of C and C++ where the decision for library authors is implicit. C/C++ developers write code as normal, if it doesn't use runtime-dependent parts, then binary developers can just use that library. This means that runtime-free binary developers can use libraries that were not intended to be used in such an environment. I've personally benefited from this while using C++.\n2. Macros - using `core::` vs `std::` in macros is a well-known issue. It forces developers to choose between macros which just work in a `#[no_std]` environment (when they use `core::`) vs. macros which just work otherwise. Is there any proposed solution? (Maybe default to `extern crate core as std`?) I feel very uncomfortable leaving this unresolved before stabilizing any parts of `#[no_std]`.\n",

    "body": "@Ericson2314 although unrelated to this issue, that seems plausible to have just a list of hashes.\n\n@dschatzberg \n\nThanks for weighing in! I think the point about implicit opt-in vs explicit is somewhat subjective, however, as I would personally not want to run into a situation that looks like:\n- Library A implicitly works with libcore, but doesn't realize it\n- Library B starts depending on A, but requires that everything is libcore-compatible\n- Library A then changes to require libstd\n\nThis means that seemingly innocuous changes in your library can cause silent breakage downstream unknowingly. With an explicit declaration that a crate is core-compatible this problem goes away.\n\nThe point about macros is certainly valid and should be considered during stabilization. Currently I personally perceive it as a minor enough nuisance that it shouldn't block stabilization of this entire ecosystem as a whole. Macros working with `core::` can be used in std crates via `extern crate core` at the root if necessary, and hopefully with macros 2.0 we can solve this problem.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton \nThis problem seems quite minor. Firstly, library authors can already make changes which cause downstream breakage. Secondly, those depending on implicitly libcore libraries could just use fixed versions and upgrade explicitly. Notice that this just shifts burden from the author of library A to library B (who has the requirement of nostd). I think this makes much more sense as nostd is much less likely and already more onerous.\n\nAs for macros, what do you expect? All macros will be modified to use `core::`? All users of macros will `extern crate core as std`? Neither of these are appealing.\n",

    "body": "To be clear, getting rid of `std` is most elegant solution to both @dschatzberg points. I hope that its elegance (as opposed to practicality) is uncontroversial.\n\nI think 1 can be refined--it's less that the silent transition from freestanding-capable to not freestanding-capable is the goal, but rather that there be only one style (a \"normal form\") for writing code that in principle should work free-standing. Right now there is two, with `core` and with `std`, and that's just awkward. Of course in a world without std its still possible to `extern crate` more than needed, but that's a very simple fix, and I consider cleaning imports part of the \"stylistic normalization\" process.\n\nNow the elastic/subset std also means there is two ways to write such code, but at least they are equivalent in terms of the burdens they place downstream. Right now that the `std` way is more conventional but `core` strictly nicer to downstream. That means not only is there two different styles, but meaningful trade-offs between them.\n\n@SimonSapin I'd hope we'd just be stabilizing the things in core that are already stable in std.\n",

    "body": "@Ericson2314 \nI'm not quite sure what you mean about there being two styles for writing freestanding code. Could you elaborate? \n\n@alexcrichton \nI believe that making freestanding implicit and allowing users to unknowingly make their library non-freestanding is strictly better than making freestanding explicit. In the explicit case, developers who want to construct freestanding libraries must, well, be explicit about this, otherwise their library cannot be used in a freestanding environment. In the implicit case, those same developers who want to construct freestanding libraries can still use a lint to enforce their desire. The only difference is that freestanding users can still use those libraries whose developers haven't considered the freestanding environment. As a freestanding user this is a pure win - I get more libraries available to me.\n",

    "body": "@phil-opp I'd consider finishing making std a facade a good thing whether or not we keep std. For example, embedded Systems (\"internet of things\") may have networking but not filesystems. As for your example, only the default hasher param uses the OS like that. I think everybody rather put HashMap in collections, and just have a wrapper type alias that adds the default hasher param in std, but there was some language restriction that prevented that.\n",
