But what about 3.5? Do we want to spend the time required to get that working again (at least until we trigger the next bug)?\n\n@brson, @alexcrichton what do you think?\n",

    "body": "We've never really had an officially supported version of LLVM just yet, we've largely just tracked whatever's \"close to master\" as far as I know. I would personally love to stick to 3.6 as long as possible (moving to 3.7 but maintaining 3.6 compatibility when it comes out) but I don't think we're willing at this point to commit to maintaining 3.6 compatibility.\n\nSo I guess to answer your question I'm not sure if it would be all that worth it to invest effort in compatibility with 3.5 (especially with no regression tests). Right now we only \"officially support\" our own fork which is \"pretty close\" to 3.6, but this situation could always change over time! I'd love to start adding some bots to gate against older LLVM versions :)\n",
