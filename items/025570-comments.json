It is left since other comments refer to it**\n\nrebase and fix of #25370\n\n~~This is still a breaking change, but could either be~~ fixed by introducing a static fallback ~~or by making enum variants first class consts (which I can do, but this PR is already getting out of hand).~~\nThe failing test ~~is~~ was\n\n``` rust\nenum E { V1(isize), V0 }\nconst C: &'static [E] = &[E::V0, E::V1(0xDEADBEE)];\nstatic C1: E = C[1];\nstatic C0: E = C[0];\n```\n\nThe failure ~~is~~ was that enum variants can currently not be evaluated inside consts. This used to work, because the const slice was secretly a static slice.\n\n```\nrun-pass/const-enum-vec-index.rs:14:16: 14:20 error: constant indexing failed: unsupported constant expr\nrun-pass/const-enum-vec-index.rs:14 static C1: E = C[1];\n                                                   ^~~~\n```\n\nr? @pnkfelix or @nrc\n\n## Explanation of changes:\n\nArray expressions, Repeat expressions ~~and references~~ are now available as `const_val`s. This allows indexing into arrays, repeats ~~and references~~ to either to be evaluated completely inside `const_eval` at compile-time and does not require llvm to solve this for us at optimization-time.\n\nThis requires a few tricks:\n1. ~~const evaluation treats statics as consts and simply squashes them if able~~\n2. ~~referencing and (auto-)dereferencing is done in the const-evaluator~~\n3. ~~statics special-treat references to indexing operations~~\n4. normal indexing ops return by-val and are computed at compile-time (llvm never knows there was an array)\n5. ~~Two references to the same element of a constant array are not guaranteed to have the same address~~ ~~references to arrays are again promoted to statics if they aren't directly dereferenced again~~\n6. ~~Two references to the same constant are not guaranteed to have the same address~~ This is [by-design](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/const-and-static.html) but not actually happening\n\n---\n\n> I'm afraid I don't understand either of the two proposals for fixing the breaking change - could you explain them in a bit more detail please?\n1. introducing a static fallback\n   if the const evaluation of an indexing operation fails, we can call the old code that did the indexing in llvm\n   This would be the safe solution, as there might be other situations where static evaluation (llvm) works but constant evaluation doesn't.\n2. by making enum variants first class consts\n   I already created new `const_val` variants for Array, Repeat and Ref. I could add an EnumVariant const val and process it properly. Right now there's just some magic that works if a c-like enum is const evaluated.\n   This is the nice solution, as it's another step towards full const evaluation of all const-evaluable code.\n\nI see now that only Solution 1. is viable in this PR, as there shouldn't be any potential for a breaking change even if mostly no code would break.\n\nFor Solution 2 I'll add another PR in the future, for now I'll just fix this by reintroducing the original fallback\n",

As I read the docs and book, it means that if you use a constant in between, you again loose all guarantees of memory locations and uniqueness of values. Although the compiler actually evaluates all constants with intermediate statics as statics\n\nEDIT: apparently the comment was deleted\n",

    "body": "so... I came to the conclusion that indexing into and derefing statics never makes sense in a static environment. except when taking the address directly again, but that's apparently not ok:\n\n> Borrowed statics can specifically _only_ have their address taken, not any number of other borrows such as borrowing fields, reading elements of an array, etc.\n\ntaking either of these by value also makes no sense... so i tried to forbid that, but this also breaks constants since there's no difference between a `&'static` that points to a constant and one that points to a static... so... one solution is to introduce `&'const` (even if just in the `ty::Region` enum), other solutions are welcome.\n\nsituations this is happening in the test-suite:\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/const-autoderef.rs#L13\nfalse positives:\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/const-deref.rs#L13\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/const-block-item.rs#L32\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/const-fields-and-indexing.rs\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/issue-17233.rs\n",

    "body": "@oli-obk Okay\n1. Sorry it has taken me so long to get around to reading your PR\n2. Overall I think the code itself, as of the current PR, is pretty clean and easy to follow, so that's good\n3. I am concerned about the potential for breaking changes to the language as discussed by @nrc earlier in this issue.  Based on the massive amount of text that you have crossed out of the description, I infer that this is _not_ a breaking change anymore.  Is this correct?\n4. Assuming that this is no longer a breaking change, I personally would like it if the description were revised to avoid so much long text that is implicitly crossed out -- when bors commits this PR, it is going to be too hard for readers to parse the text of those commits when they are not rendered by markdown.  I understand the desire to preserve the history of the description; I suggest revising the description to a format like this:\n   \n   ```\n   This is the new description.  It is short and reflects the \n   state of the PR at the time it is landing.\n   \n   (Old description follows)\n   \n   ----\n   \n   Here you ~~cut-and-paste~~ transcribe the current\n   description that ~~pnkfelix~~ someone complained\n   about with ~~lots of~~ embedded strike-outs.\n   Hopefully the reader using git in a terminal will\n   understand that they should not bother looking too\n   much at this text.\n   ```\n\nPersonally I'm actually relatively okay with the idea of merging the code changes proposed in this PR, assuming my understanding from above that this is a non-breaking change is correct.\n\n@nrc do you have thoughts on this?\n\nOne last thought: We _might_ consider adding a feature-gate to try cover our collective asses, i.e. give the change some time to breathe without risk of breakage leaking into the stable world.  But I'm not sure a feature gate pays for itself here.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis I suppose the broader question is what criteria we should use in deciding whether to impose a feature gate.\n\nI see three potential reasons for a feature gate:\n1. When we do not know whether we want a feature (in any form) at all\n2. When we have decided we want a feature, but there are details about its specified semantics that we are not sure about. (Note that there a range of potential semantics that we can assign, and there is a partial ordering between them, since we can reject code statically when it fails to adhere to some base set of rules ... so we might feature-gate some extension to a semantics, but leave the core ungated).\n3. When we think we know the semantics we want for a feature, but we are not confident that we can commit to the \"current\" implementation.\n\nDoes that sounds about right?\n\nIn this case, I _think_ the answers are: (1.) we want this (but maybe others would disagree), (2.) any possible semantics we might choose is going to include what is outlined here, I think (i.e. this probably occupies a low point in the partial ordering of potential semantics that I alluded to above). So the only question mark for me is (3.): is the implementation sufficiently low-risk that we can side-step a gate?  And I don't have a confident answer there.\n",

    "body": "So let me be clear on my concern. In general, I think that constant expression evaluation is a kind of \"ad-hoc, best-effort\" mess whose limits are not well documented and are only understood by a relatively small set. The very fact that we have two constant evaluators that handle two distinct subsets -- and slightly differently, at times, though of course those are \"just bugs\" -- is sort of what I'm talking about. I would very much like to refactor things so that we have ONE constant evaluator that is following a relatively documented, comprehensible process. And I'm wary of accidentally enabling evaluation of expressions that turns out to work most of the time, but have rough edges. Let me give you another concrete example: we currently allow you to \"dereference\" an `&'static` pointer, which -- when it points into a `static` -- perhaps ought to be disallowed. Certainly it leads to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29884, which was partly because of a (rather ad-hoc) decision to support static recursion (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29719). Luckily we put a feature-gate on this decision, so we have some luxury to either prohibit derefs into statics or else fix https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29719 before we are overly committed. So I think it's pretty reasonable to move slow in terms of allowing arbitrary stable code to make use of extended sets of constant expressions.\n\nNow, indexing and dereferences are basically the same thing, so an example of something I'd like to be careful about is: what happens if you try to index into the content of a `static` here?\n\nAll this is not to say we need a feature-gate, but just to say that there is evidence that there is reason to think that @pnkfelix's condition #2 may apply here:\n\n> When we have decided we want a feature, but there are details about its specified semantics that we are not sure about.\n\nBasically, I think it might be prudent to place a kind of feature gate around ALL expansions of constants until we have something a bit more disciplined (at least a unified evaluator, ideally an RFC laying out what is expected to work).\n",
