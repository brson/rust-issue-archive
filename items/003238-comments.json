    "body": "Interestingly, I realized today that fixing this bug also allows us to resolve some other thorny issues in defining the region system. In particular, we could solve #3696 in the ideal way---that is, we can wait to define the region hierarchy at all until just before regionck, when types are known. Another problem that would be solved is a bug related to the nested lifetime extension in closures---sometimes the full types of closure arguments are not known until the end, so we can't establish the relationships between their free regions.\n",
