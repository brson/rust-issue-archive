Would you mind adding some comments to the [relevant RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/576) instead?\n\nWe're currently going to largely freeze the current I/O system in order to prevent future breakage with it. We hope to take all known feedback into account with the upcoming I/O system (spelled out in RFCs), so please leave some feedback!\n",
