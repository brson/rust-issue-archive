I didn't look at such pages while developing the layout, I will fix this.\n\n---\n\n> The docs were more readable with the previous font.\n\nBecause it is a serif font? &ndash; If so it is a matter of accomodation, few websites make use of them actually (for instance, [blog](http://unfiltered.me/) or [newspaper](http://www.liberation.fr/)).\n",

    "body": "> Along these lines: headers within a doc comment now take up a lot of space, and look a lot like they're page layout headings, not just subheadings for a specific function (e.g. the failure heading in http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/c_str/struct.CString.html#method.with_ref).\n\nThanks for the pointer, looks like I only fixed a part of this.\n",
