    "body": "I wonder if this is an artifact of our need to use the type-checker to resolve the ambiguity as to whether `P(e1, e2)` is a tuple-construction or a function call.  I.e. we need to resolve the type of `P` to disambiguate that case, and the `RUST_LOG` output I see includes that as a difference between the two cases here.\n\n(Or it could be a red-herring.  Seems more likely that its a red herring, since I do not see what it would mean to attempt to \"more eagerly resolve P\" in the expression `P { car: e1, cdr; e2 }`)\n",
