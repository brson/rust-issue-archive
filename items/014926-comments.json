You'll also find some relevant bits in `src/librustuv/timeout.rs` and `src/librustuv/stream.rs` (although timeouts may not be too relevant).\n\nThinking about it a bit, I'm not sure if it makes sense to provide a `close_write` method because I'm not sure that UDP can actually block in a call to `sendto`. There's no acknowledgement of a packet being sent, so I'd be under the impression that it's a fire-and-forget situation.\n",
