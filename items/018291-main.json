  "body": "This PR changes the signature of several methods from `foo(self, ...)` to `foo(&self, ...)`/`foo(&mut self, ...)`, but there is no breakage of the usage of these methods due to the autoref nature of `method.call()`s. This PR also removes the lifetime parameter from some traits (`Trait<'a>` -> `Trait`). These changes break any use of the extension traits for generic programming, but those traits are not meant to be used for generic programming in the first place. In the whole rust distribution there was only one misuse of a extension trait as a bound, which got corrected (the bound was unnecessary and got removed) as part of this PR.\n\nI've kept the commits as small and self-contained as possible for reviewing sake, but I can squash them when the review is over.\n\nSee this [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MZ_iSNuzsoqeS-mtLXnj9m0hBYaH5jI8k9G_Ud8FT5g/edit?usp=sharing) to get an idea of what's left to be done. I've already DSTified [`Show`](https://github.com/japaric/rust/commits/show) and I'm working on `Hash`, but bootstrapping those changes seem to require a more recent snapshot (#18259 does the trick)\n\nr? @aturon \ncc #16918 \n",
