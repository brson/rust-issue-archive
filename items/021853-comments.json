With the current definition the best we could write in the future is `I: IntoIterator, I::Iter::Item: Str` and `I: IntoIterator, I::Iter: Iterator<Item=u8>`. Whereas the proposed change would let us write `I: IntoIterator, I::Item: Str` (1) and `I: IntoIterator<Item=u8>`.\n\n(1) (I wonder if we could allow `I: IntoIterator<Item: Str>` as a short-hand for `I: IntoIterator, I::Item: Str`? Or is that too crazy?)\n\n> It imposes a slight ergonomic burden on implementors, but once default associated types land we should be able to remove that burden.\n\nYes, I think that default type params would let us remove `type Item = Foo` from the implementations.\n\n> I think the Iter associated type should probably be called IntoIter\n\nIf we are going to add `type Item`, then I'm not going to oppose to changing the name of `Iter`, as it won't be used in most cases (i.e. in assoc type bindings), just in the implementations.\n",
