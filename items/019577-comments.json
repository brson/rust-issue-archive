    "body": "As a practical matter, I think that would work on any sane platform (though it would impose a run-time cost of subtracting 1 from the stored value each time you try to actually use the key). From a pure portability standpoint, does the POSIX standard allow the created key to be -1? I think it does, which would mean the portability issue still exists (though it's much more difficult to imagine a platform that would actually return -1). To my mind, a better solution involves not having a reserved value for the key, though I'm not sure how that would work...\n",
