  "body": "- renames `Default` to `Show`\n- introduces some hidden `std::fmt::secret_...` functions, designed to work-around the lack of UFCS (with UFCS they can be replaced by referencing the trait methods directly) because I'm going to convert the traits to have methods rather than static functions, since `#[deriving]` works much better with true methods.\n\nI'm blocked on a snapshot after this. (I could probably do a large number of `#[cfg]`s, but I can work on other things in the meantime.)\n",
