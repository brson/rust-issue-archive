    "body": "This is (indeed) by design.\n\n(Ideally we would figure out a way to tweak the Rvalue lifetime rules so that the two forms are equivalent, but I do not know if that is feasible.)\n\n---\n\nThe reason this is occurring: when determining the lifetime for an rvalue, there are a couple different tricks for extending the lifetimes of temporary rvalues to last as long as the scope of some variable binding, rather than the statement the rvalues happen to appear within. (These still need to be documented _somewhere_ outside of the code, see also #12032.)\n\nThe particular detail here is we descend expressions according to a grammar to determine which rvalues should have their lifetimes extended, and right now, that grammar looks like this:\n\n```\nET ::= * ET      // dereference\n    | ET[...]    // index\n    | ET.f       // field access\n    | ( ET )     // parenthesized\n    | <rvalue>\n```\n\nNote that the above does _not_ have method call `ET.m(...)`.\n\nThat's the heart of why this is happening: the temporary lifetime rules are based on the syntax that has not had the index expressions desugared to method calls, so you end up with more convenient rules in terms of how long the receiver lives in those cases.\n\n---\n\nI think it might be interesting to try to extend the rules here so that the grammar looks like this:\n\n```\nET ::= ...        // as above\n    | ET.m(...)   // *only* for m that takes `&self` \n                  // or `&mut self`, *not* `self`-by-value\n```\n\nUpdate: we probably would also want the lifetime `'a` in `&'a self`/`&'a mut self` to be invariant and in the return type of the called method. The reason for the restriction to invariant `'a` is that we want to capture the cases where 'a is in the return type in a way that actually corresponds to a reference being passed back to the caller. E.g. we don't want to fall into a trap where the 'a is variant and is able to correspond to a shorter lifetime than that of the whole block, since in that case, extending the lifetime could cause existing code to break (in the sense that it may inject borrowck rejections).\n\nIts also possible that the extension under consideration belongs in the `E&` grammar rather than the `ET` grammar. (See [comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6ae350213485f7c917113f3916e58c51cef97a76/src/librustc/middle/region.rs#L870) in code.)\n",
