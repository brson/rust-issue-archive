We're developing some new conventions for the `Show` trait to precisely explain its purpose, but the gist of it is that `Show` is intended for debugging and I don't think it necessarily needs to be a 100% accurate representation of the underlying primitive.\n",

The goal was to make the output unambiguous so that I could debug the cause of a command failure (within cargo, as it happens) due to the contents of environment variables being less-than-ideal.\n\nI'd be happy to accept any output that I can look at and definitively know what the arguments & command are. This is one way to accomplish that. It's also probably the most recognizable way to do so, given the context of executing commands. IIRC, windows doesn't even have a standard way of parsing arguments to commands, it hands programs the whole string.\n\nAnd on removing \"unneeded\" quotes:\n- it isn't necessary for making the command unambiguous for debugging\n- it has the potential to make people wonder whether or not things are actually quoted.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton Sorry, I made an incorrect comment about number of quotes and it was misleading to mention to Bash there.  POSIX sh supports [single-quote strings which don't accept any escaped characters](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_02_02).  But when we write two or more strings without any intervening word delimiters (`$IFS`,) they are internally concatenated.  OTOH `\\'` is one of the standard escaped characters outside a single-quote string.  So `'a'\\''b'` denotes a single string of three letters and we may colloquially say we escape a single quote as `'\\''` in a single-quote string.\n\nI'd like to support this patch.  I would say, if\n\n> `Show` is intended for debugging\n\nthen it **does need**\n\n> to be a 100% accurate representation of the underlying primitive\n\nbecause we don't want to do debugging based on inaccurate information.  Also, this approach makes reverse conversion simpler.\n\nPassing parameters to a child with 100 % correctness is quite tricky on Windows and it does **not** mean \"we can copy&paste the final parameter string to `cmd.exe`:\"\n- http://blogs.msdn.com/b/twistylittlepassagesallalike/archive/2011/04/23/everyone-quotes-arguments-the-wrong-way.aspx Jump to \"Conclusion\"\n\nThat is, there are cases we need to choose from two different alternatives:\n1. a raw string passed to Win32 API `CreateProcessW()`, or\n2. a string which we can copy&paste to `cmd.exe`\n",
