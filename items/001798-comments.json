    "body": "@cmr: the 5% performance boost was actually for large allocations\n\nFor small ones (like TreeMap), using tcmalloc/jemalloc is a much bigger win over glibc. Both of them are similar in that they have thread-local caches, with objects organized into groups by size (as does glibc, but it rounds sizes more). They release physical memory usage with MADV_DONTNEED instead of giving the virtual memory back the OS.\n\nThey're both pretty close for single-threaded performance based on a few different tests and consistently beat glibc in both time and memory usage (VIRT and RES - but they don't reduce VIRT from the peak unlike glibc). Especially with small allocations, they don't do nearly as much rounding up of sizes and don't have nearly as much metadata overhead - that really helps for `std::treemap`.\n\nI haven't done much testing of how they scale with threads. Based on reading the documentation and some in-depth articles, tcmalloc seems to handle a fluctuating number of threads better while jemalloc specializes for thread pools.\n",
