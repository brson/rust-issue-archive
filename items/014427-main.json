  "body": "This commit shuffles around some of the `rand` code, along with some\nreorganization. The new state of the world is as follows:\n- The librand crate now only depends on libcore. This interface is experimental.\n- The standard library has a new module, `std::rand`. This interface will\n  eventually become stable.\n\nUnfortunately, this entailed more of a breaking change than just shuffling some\nnames around. The following breaking changes were made to the rand library:\n- Rng::gen_vec() was removed. This has been replaced with Rng::gen_iter() which\n  will return an infinite stream of random values. Previous behavior can be\n  regained with `rng.gen_iter().take(n).collect()`\n- Rng::gen_ascii_str() was removed. This has been replaced with\n  Rng::gen_ascii_chars() which will return an infinite stream of random ascii\n  characters. Similarly to gen_iter(), previous behavior can be emulated with\n  `rng.gen_ascii_chars().take(n).collect()`\n- {IsaacRng, Isaac64Rng, XorShiftRng}::new() have all been removed. These all\n  relied on being able to use an OSRng for seeding, but this is no longer\n  available in librand (where these types are defined). To retain the same\n  functionality, these types now implement the `Rand` trait so they can be\n  generated with a random seed from another random number generator. This allows\n  the stdlib to use an OSRng to create seeded instances of these RNGs.\n- Rand implementations for `Box<T>` and `@T` were removed. These seemed to be\n  pretty rare in the codebase, and it allows for libcore to not depend on\n  liballoc.  Additionally, other pointer types like Rc<T> and Arc<T> were not\n  supported.  If this is undesirable, librand can depend on liballoc and regain\n  these implementations.\n- The WeightedChoice structure is no longer built with a `Vec<Weighted<T>>`,\n  but rather a `&mut [Weighted<T>]`. This means that the WeightedChoice\n  structure now has a lifetime associated with it.\n\ncc #13851\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
