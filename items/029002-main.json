  "body": "I've surprised with contradictory compiler's behaviour in the following code:\n\n``` rust\n\ntrait Extractor<T> {\n    fn extract(&self) -> Option<T>;\n}\n\nstruct Container;\n\nimpl Extractor<String> for Container {\n    fn extract(&self) -> Option<String> { None }\n}\n\nfn expected(_: &str) { }\n\nfn main() {\n    let c = Container;\n    match c.extract() {\n        Some(ref s) => expected(s),\n        None => (),\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThat compiles well as long as I don't add an another implementation:\n\n``` rust\nimpl Extractor<i64> for Container {\n    fn extract(&self) -> Option<i64> { None }\n}\n```\n\nNow the same code doesn't work and compilation fails with:\n\n```\n<anon>:21:13: 21:22 error: the trait `core::marker::Sized` is not implemented for the type `str` [E0277]\n<anon>:21     match c.extract() {\n                      ^~~~~~~~~\n<anon>:21:13: 21:22 help: see the detailed explanation for E0277\n<anon>:21:13: 21:22 note: `str` does not have a constant size known at compile-time\n<anon>:21     match c.extract() {\n                      ^~~~~~~~~\n```\n\nI know how to specify type, but I'm more concerned with unexpected behaviour. Why compiler had confused?\n",
