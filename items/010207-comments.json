    "body": "In the super-ideal world, then the SVH is actually only based on what external crates can touch. If I have a truly internal implementation detail that changes, then the SVH shouldn't necessarily change (and likewise if I change documentation it shouldn't change the SVH). This would mean that the SVH is only dependent on _reachable_ items from the crate.\n\nThis is very difficult to generate reliably, however, and I think that for now we should literally call `crate.hash()` to get the hash value of the crate. Using reachability for the hash is a very far-future thing that would be nice to have, but is totally not necessary. This would in theory truly allow for in-place binary upgrades.\n",
