    "body": "I believe that slices are correct. They use `offset` to figure out the start, but that doesn't really matter. Their length is calculated just fine with `nonzero_size_of`.\n\nFixed-size arrays also don't appear to be wrong. Their actual size may be questionable, but the iteration works just fine over them.\n\nI'm not quite comfortable with a `nonzero_offset` method because it doesn't really make sense. The struct itself is 0-sized so there's not really an address to memory containing it. I think that this needs to know how big the vector actually is in memory. Slices don't really matter so long as their size field is correct, but the actual vector representations still have a concept of length somehow and I'm just not sure what that is...\n\nIf we used a `nonzero_offset` method, then you would be generating pointers past the bounds of the vector in theory. If the vector were truly 0-sized (and just some length on the side), then generating pointers beyond the base of the vector would be invalid, right? Even if you don't actually read the memory, it seems wrong to get pointers to other data.\n\nAlso, I don't think that anyone else should seriously be using a `nonzero_offset` method (I could be wrong here), so adding it to `ptr` seems like a bad idea.\n",
