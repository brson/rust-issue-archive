    "body": "It looks to be that we have a section of constraints which are all dedicated to \"output constraints\", but it's possible to have an output constraint which isn't validated to be writable? It seems to me that we should merge all the constraints into one list (having `=` denote whether it's input or output), or we should leave the lists separate and not require `=` at all (because it's implied by where it's located). If we need to add the constraint for LLVM, then we can to that at trans time.\n\nOr is there a purpose for having an output constraint without an `=`?\n",
