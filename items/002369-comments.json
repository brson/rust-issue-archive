Manually deleting the hidden files should never be required - e.g. right now I sometimes have to delete .cargo when I update rustc from git, but I think that the incremental compiler should detect when rustc/libstd/core have changed and automatically delete the now-invalid .build files.\n",

    "body": "If we do this at the level of \"caching bitcode for distinguished subtreees of a crate\", it's probably not too hard (though I'm not sure it'll make things a lot faster). If we do this at the level of \"trying to cache target-machine object files\", things get a fair bit weirder. We (or, well, I) chose the existing compilation model for crates based on the need to \"eventually\" do cross-module optimization (in particular, single-instantiation of monomorphic code and inlining). Crates were the optimization boundary, the compilation-unit boundary.\n\nWe have subsequently grown cross-crate inlining. So this distinction is a _bit_ less meaningful, at least in terms of optimization. There is still a meaningful (in the sense of \"not easy to eliminate or blur\") linkage boundary at work in two terms: monomorphization instantiations and version-insensitivity (the \"anything called 1.0 with the same types is the same crate\" rule discussed last week).\n\nOverall, this is one of a few bugs pointing in a similar direction: #2176, #1980, #2238, #558, #2166, #456 and even #552 to some extent.\n\nI am not saying these are all wrong. They are all pointing to similar sets of semantic weaknesses .. or \"surprises\" .. in the existing compilation model. I would like to have a conversation at some point (probably in public, or videoconf, or both) where we approach this problem as a _design_ problem, and try to work out a new set of agreeable principles and plan-of-action for future work that spans the whole set of related bugs. I do want to fix them, but do not want to go much further down this road without having a map of where we're going.\n\nAs an example: it could be that we wind up treating all inter-module functionality uniformly via a multiple dimensions of a single kind of `link` item, with inter-link _versioning_ (either \"symbolic\" or \"by content\") managed _orthogonally_ from the nested-source, recycled-bitcode, static-library or dynamic-library linkage _format_. Being able to vary these independently -- and even switch between them depending on selected configuration -- might make a lot more sense than endlessly patching up the increasingly-vague \"crate\" concept. It might be past its expiration date.\n",

    "body": "Hi, let me give some pointers to the Haskell world. GHC has this solved - and probably the best working incremental recompilation engine on the planet.\n\nIt can do:\n- recompilation avoidance for module **imports** (easy for any language that doesn't implement imports by _string concatenation_ - hi C++ \n- recompilation avoidance **within** Haskell packages (equivalent to crates)\n- recompilation avoidance **across** Haskell packages (this even works for system-installed packages: GHC notices when a globally installed library changes its interface files - this has the effect as if a Makefile included correct dependencies on all of the system level `/usr/include/**.h` files, and gives correct builds even in changing environments)\n- recompilation avoidance on a **semantic** level (changing a comment doesn't invalidate downstream modules like it would in `make`)\n- recompilation avoidance at **function granularity** (changed function not used => don't need to recompile downstream if the includer doesn't use that very function)\n- recompilation avoidance even if TemplateHaskell (AST modifying macro language) is involved\n- detection of **compilation flag changes**\n- all of the above in presence of **whole program optimization** (cross-module inlining)\n- all of the above in presence of **parallel** builds (`ghc --make -j`)\n- all of the above with **full correctness** (in my 5 years of Haskell programming I have not once encountered a case where the equivalent of a `make clean` would have been necessary with `ghc --make`)\n\nGHC has documented its approach in high detail, and highlighted what the problems are. See here:\n\nhttps://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/RecompilationAvoidance\n\nI believe that Rust is in perfect shape to reach the same level of incremental compilation, and can likely apply the same techniques. \n\nIt's all there, we just have to copy it ;)\n\n> Personally, I do still believe that compilers shouldn't be to claver about how to build projects and attempting to replace tools like make wouldn't likely end quite well\n\nI once also thought so, but this is not the case. External build tools like `make`, `tup`, or even `Shake` (which has really figured it out) can never reach the same level of granularity that a compiler can, given that it understands what syntax (comments etc.) and semantics (includes, unused functions) are.\n",

    "body": "The problem with 99% of build tools out there is that they duplicate the dependency management by either letting the user specify dependencies prior to target execution and/or by scanning them heuristically with prior knowledge over the type of executed target, and often doing so wrongly, failing to duplicate intrinsic logic, resulting in broken or failed builds. The builds are sometimes slower than they could be because the developer forsakes on specifying dependencies in favor of safe but slow re-execution, to avoid the aforementioned broken builds.\n\nI suggest that you look into [a newer approach](https://github.com/ElastiLotem/buildsome), where dependencies are detected reliably for any kind of intermediate. The developer only needs to worry about target invocation itself. So, if you neatly split the build process to a DAG of separate process invocations, even with extremely complicated dependencies, this tool can track them easily.\n",

Take for example Haskell's [`Data.Bits`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.2.0/docs/Data-Bits.html) module in the `base` package. You would definitely want functions like bitwise-or to be inlined. If the inlining boundary was at the library level, this would not be possible. GHC solves this by using a heuristic on the size of the function; if it's small (or otherwise inline-worthy), an \"unfolding\" (IR syntax tree) is put into the Interface File `Data/Bits.hi` (on which GHC's incremental compilation works) so that other modules can inline the unfolding. If `Data.Bits` was updated to a different implementation of bitwise-or, incremental compilation would \"just work\": The Haskell file would be detected as being changed, the Interface File would be updated, and all users of that unfolding would be recompiled.\nIt is not clear to me if the current RFC permits this type of cross-library inlining or not.\n",

Wouldn't it make sense to include source files in the dependency graph as well, so that you can skip parsing and even reading the file contents if the file modification time suggests that the file has not changed?\n\nEventually perhaps yes. But for the initial versions, we're targeting the things in compilation that are most expensive: LLVM and type-checking. Hashing the HIR also means that we can avoid doing recompilation for smaller, trivial changes, like tweaking a comment -- at least in some cases (it turns out that because that affects the line/col number of all statements, we would need to change at least debuginfo, but we can hopefully isolate the effects of that in the future.)\n\nThere are also just practical concerns. It's much easier to reduce the amount of the compiler we have to instrument.\n\n> I'm not familiar with codegen units, and where their boundaries would be set, but if it's typically on the library/crate level, that could make some inlining problematic.\n\nUsers can always add `#[inline]` manually to indicate things that should be inlined widely (e.g., across crates).\n",

    "body": "@nh2: It's frustrating (and hardly uncommon) for people to show up and say we \"just need to copy Haskell\" while ignoring the very real differences between the languages. In this case, the most important difference is that a whole Rust crate is semantically a single compilation unit, in fact a single syntax tree. Any `.rs` file in a crate can use stuff from any other `.rs` file, without any kind of forward declaration. This simply isn't true for the `.hs` files in a Haskell package. Mutually recursive imports will give you an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ghc --make Main.hs\r\nModule imports form a cycle:\r\n         module \u2018Foo\u2019 (./Foo.hs)\r\n        imports \u2018Bar\u2019 (./Bar.hs)\r\n  which imports \u2018Foo\u2019 (./Foo.hs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only way around this is the tedious and error-prone approach of writing a [hs-boot file](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/separate_compilation.html#how-to-compile-mutually-recursive-modules), equivalent to writing header files in C. In practice almost nobody does this; they simply structure their programs so the module dependency graph is acyclic. In terms of the build system (*not* in terms of packaging / versioning), this is like placing every `.rs` file into its own crate.\r\n\r\nSo, most of the features you highlight in `ghc --make` are present in Rust -- but they're features of Cargo, not rustc! True incremental compilation, within a single unit of mutually-referential stuff, is to my knowledge not a problem GHC tries to solve.",
