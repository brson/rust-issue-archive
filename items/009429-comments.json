    "body": "I'm personally a fan of this, it looks pretty awesome. Here's some thoughts:\n- ~~I think `Mut` needs a destructor asserting that there are no outstanding loans on it.~~ edit: nevermind, turns out rust is awesome for this exact reason.\n- I think `ReadPtr`/`WritePtr` should have a `value` fields instead of a `get()` function.\n- If `Mut` exists, I don't think `Cell` should at all.\n- Should this use similar conventions with `as_imm`/`as_mut` and drop the `map` functions?\n- I think two implementations is fine, especially because `Cell` is so popular right now. Perhaps you could even have `type Cell<T> = Mut<Option<T>>` in the `mutable` module.\n- I definitely think that multiple read pointers should be allowed (that's the point, right?).\n\nI don't entirely remember why `Mut` was removed in the first place, so someone who remembers why should probably comment on whether we want to bring it back in this manifestation or not.\n\nNice work, though!\n",

    "body": "Thank you for the direct points!\n\n> I think ReadPtr/WritePtr should have a value fields instead of a get() function.\n\nI'll explain why I think this is impossible. The lifetime relations are crucial.\n\n```\n// Mut<T>\npub fn borrow<'a>(&'a self) -> ReadPtr<'a, T>\n```\n\nThe `ReadPtr<'a, T>` can maximally live as long as the `Mut<T>`.\n\n```\n// ReadPtr<T>\npub fn get<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a T\n```\n\nThe derived borrowed pointer can maximally live as long as the `ReadPtr`, which is the duration that it is reserved in the parent `Mut<T>`. This is crucial. If we allowed to get a borrow pointer here with a life longer than the `ReadPtr` itself, the dynamic borrow check breaks down. I don't think this is possible to do with a value struct member.  (This is an important thing to look at if we'd allow overloading dereferences or something similar.)\n\n> Should this use similar conventions with as_imm/as_mut and drop the map functions?\n\nI'm not sure if this is possible! The `map` / `map_mut` methods are just convenience wrappers around the borrow methods, partly because you can't chain:  `*obj.borrow_mut().get()  /* lifetime error */`  probably just because of the lifetime logic elaborated above.\n\n> I think two implementations is fine, especially because Cell is so popular right now. Perhaps you could even have type Cell<T> = Mut<Option<T>> in the mutable module.\n\nThe Cell type is/was rarely named at all, anywhere; It's used in stack values, and so the choice of constructor function: `Mut::new_some(u) -> Mut<Option<U>>` and methods names like `obj.take_unwrap()` is the important part.\n",
