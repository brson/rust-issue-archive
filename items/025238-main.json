  "body": "I've been working with some archives generated by MSVC's `lib.exe` tool lately,\nand it looks like the embedded name of the members in those archives sometimes\nhave slahes in the name (e.g. `foo/bar/baz.obj`). Currently the compiler chokes\non these paths as it assumes that each file in the archive is only the filename\n(which is what unix does).\n\nThis commit interprets the name of each file in all archives as a path and then\nonly uses the `file_name` portion of the path to extract the file to a separate\nlocation and then reassemble it back into a new archive later. Note that\nduplicate filenames are already handled, so this won't introduce any conflicts.\n",
