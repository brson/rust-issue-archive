  "body": "Enough said.\n\nFixes #18639.\n\nr? @pcwalton (or someone else?)\n\nThis is a [breaking-change]. In particular, several feature gates related to unboxed closures were consolidated into one (`overloaded_calls`, `unboxed_closure_sugar` => `unboxed_closures`). Otherwise, I think everything that worked before should still work. File a bug and cc @nikomatsakis if you find otherwise. :)\n",
