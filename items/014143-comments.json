(And in all other cases, it is no less \"secure\", although it does block, as stated in both the quoted documentation and your own essay.)\n\nI emphasise \"more\" there because the paragraph carefully _doesn't_ say that `/dev/urandom` is actually insecure; it's purely comparative.\n\nIn any case, https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13820 clarifies that the quality problems with Linux's `/dev/urandom` are only during initialisation/when there are few entropy sources.\n",
