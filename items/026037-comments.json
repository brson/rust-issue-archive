I have personally tested it on Firefox 38, Chrome 43, and IE 11 (also tested it in IE 10 and IE 9 mode via the developer tools) on Win 7.\n\nI expect IE 8 and lower to _not_ work (which would be the same as it is today).\n\nAlso, the \"mouseenter\" and \"mouseleave\" events may have less support than jQuery, see:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseenter#Browser_compatibility\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseleave#Browser_compatibility\n\nIf it's a problem, I think I could re-write it to use the less-friendly, ~~but standardized,~~ (Edit: actually, the mouseenter/leave events _are_ standardized: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-mouseenter) \"mouseover\" and \"mouseout\" events instead.\n",
