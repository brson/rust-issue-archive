    "body": "Oops, you already did this!\n\nI also implemented this myself, but in a slightly different way. Instead of always adding one more `#`, my algorithm searches for the pattern `\"#*` and calculates the minimum number of `#`s required. So a simple case like `/// Hello world` is directly converted to `r\"Hello world\"`, not `r#\"Hello world\"#`, and something like `/// ##` is also translated to `r\"##\"`, rather than `r###\"##\"###`. I think the generated raw strings are a bit clearer in this way.\n\nYou can see the code here: https://github.com/barosl/rust/commit/f6504aa91ee983584828edea8481a08214873ce9\n\nWould you mind closing this? I'll open mine. Sorry for not telling this earlier. :cry:\n",
