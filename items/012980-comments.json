    "body": "I don't quite understand why stdout and stdin need to be unified into one object. The existing I/O objects generally represent separate functionality as separate objects. The stdin/stdout file descriptors aren't necessarily a stream, so I'm not sure that they should be connected.\n\nThis also seems odd to move the entire `stdio` module just to make room for one `stdio` function. I would rather just have `StdReader` flush the task-local stdout on reads.\n",
