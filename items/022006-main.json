The main point is to illustrate the fallout that occurs with the compiler type inference as it stands today.\n\n(Notably, we do not infer `Box<_>` for `box <expr>` in the context of `(box <expr> as Box<Trait>)`, and this weakness is a cause of a lot of the fallout below.)\n\npnkfelix is trying to see if he can revise `vtable::check_object_cast` to remove the above limitation, which would let us revert a lot of the fallout below.\n\n---\n\nsee also https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/809 (which is not merged as of this writing).\n",
