My question is: Is the SVH a good choice for identifying the crate? Is it even going to stay? The crate-id RFC got me confused.\n\nAIUI SVH is just designed as a internal compiler thing for identifying when two crates are different (e.g. detect when they've been compiled with an different, incompatible version of rustc). @alexcrichton would know more.\n",

    "body": "Thanks for your comments, @huonw and @pnkfelix!\nThe SVH-approach should always provide something that works, but it might disambiguate types a bit too much.\nTake the following case as example: I have two versions of a crate that only slightly differ: A' and A''. And I have one dependency that links to A' and another one that links to A'':\n\n```\nA' <--- D1 <--+\n                \\\n                 +-- MyExe\n                /\nA'' <-- D2 <--+\n```\n\nAlthough 99% of the types in A' and A'' might be exactly the same, they will all be distinct as far as debuginfo is concerned, leading to a lot of duplication. Apart from the wasted space, the debuginfo should be fine though. And the same kind of duplication should happen for everything else in the two crates, as rustc won't check if `A'::TypeX` is the same as `A''::TypeX`, right?\n",

    "body": "@nick29581 Yeah, it seems that this is an error in the TypeMap consistency check. A quick hack to get rid of the error is to just comment out the two `Session::bug()` calls at https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/trans/debuginfo.rs#L239 and https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/trans/debuginfo.rs#L252. A proper fix will take a bit longer and I won't have time for it before next Wednesday. I'll open an issue so I don't forget. Sorry for the inconvenience!\n",
