    "body": "Sounds like a fine motivation for exposing some of the internals! A few notes...\n\nI think the primary issue with exposing the internals is, if we expose something, will we need to eventually make a stability guarantee about the things we're exposing? Or can it just be marked experimental for the foreseeable future?\n\nThe existing regex implementation is, frankly, a _first draft_ in terms of performance. There is still room for a lot of performance improvement, and it isn't clear to me how this may or may not change the internals.\n\nI would also strongly suggest that if we expose any internals, that they be exposed via a sub-module so as not to interfere with the real public interface.\n",
