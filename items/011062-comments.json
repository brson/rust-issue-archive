    "body": "I do not disagree about that, that's why I'm recommending that this all be placed in the `LittleLock` primitive. Splitting the `Mutex` primitive into separate types should be filed as a separate issue (this is not the best place for this discussion). The `LittleLock` type is a much more specialized use-case than using OS mutexes in general, and regardless all of these types should be considered unstable and to be avoided because code written with OS mutexes will not work at all with green threads unless written very carefully.\n\nIt is out of necessity for the implementation of various things outside of libstd that we provide blocking OS mutexes, but these are _not_ the primitives that should be reached for in library code which is why many of the functions are flagged as unsafe. Again though, this issues is not the right place for this discussion.\n",
