    "body": "@aturon The use cases in `rust-image` are storing a `Vec<P> where P: Pixel<T>, T: Primitive`, and then accessing that vector as bytes for pixel-component operations. When sending arrays across the network, it'd also be useful to have this for primitive arrays, without having to do a loop and `.write_be_u16`, for example (if you need to do an endian swap, you can do it on the entire buffer before hand, though a buffered reader might suffice), though this is quite niche given general purpose, high-speed serialization libraries, and not hand-written hacky things.\n\nI've begun a casual audit of unsafe code used by various libraries, and this is a core piece of `rust-image`, and I have a feeling this pattern is widely applicable to applications which need to work with representations.\n",
