    "body": "Can you explain why you think that `{ {1} .. }.start` should parse as `{1; ..}.start`? I'm not familiar with the details of Rust's semicolon insertion.\n\nI would expect `{}` within an expression to work pretty much wherever `()` does (except in if conditions / match expressions or similar, where `{}` starts the control flow block), and `((1)..).start` is definitely valid syntax.\n\nOn all other examples, I'd say the rustc behavior is correct. The decision in #21374 was: `..` is non-associative has the same precedence as the assignment operator. The unary forms of `..` are only valid at the same precedence level as the binary form.\n\nComparing ranges needs parentheses: the attempt to give `..` a higher precedence than the comparison operators in #20811 was not adopted because it caused new ambiguities between unary and binary `&&`, e.g. in `r == 1.. && condition`.\n\nAdmittedly, having `..` at the same precedence level as assignment is somewhat weird, as the operators on that level have different associativity (assignment is right-associative; `..` is non-associative). It would be better to put `..` on its own level directly above the assignment operator and placement-new-arrow.\n",

You can type `DOTDOT DOT ID` and see what CST is parsed, or whether it's rejected.)\n\nSome parser generators (e.g. menhir) allowing parameterizing rules.  e.g. Maybe a formal grammar could have a single `range_expr` rule that is parameterized over each of the restrictions.\n\n(Also: I get the impression that the nonparen restriction class might be going away.

    "body": "Actually, I'm starting to think that the rustc behavior might not be ideal: it interacts badly with lambda syntax.\n\nRust currently has 7 non-associative operators: `..` and the 6 comparison operators. But within lambdas, these behave differently!\n\nRustc currently rejects `|a, b| a == b == c` as a syntax error (cannot chain comparison operators).\nBut it parses `|a, b| a .. b .. c` successfully, as `(|a, b| (a .. b)) .. c`.\n\nLambdas have the same \"precedence inversion\" problem that I tried to avoid for (unary) `..`: they can appear within operators with high precedence, but contain an arbitrary expression with lower precedence.\n\nFor example, `a * || b + c` is a syntactically valid expression, parsing as `a * (|| (b + c))`. A programmer who knows about the precedence of `*` and `+` but not about the effect of lambdas would probably expect `(a * (|| b)) + c` instead.\n\nThis gets especially problematic when the programmer assumes the lambda body is an expression, but the expression actually ends earlier. Is `|a, b| a .. b .. c` the only case of a valid expression that \"breaks out\" of the lambda?\n\nOne solution would be to parse `..` as parser-larl does, and then later reject syntax trees where `..` appears as operand of another operator with higher precedence. (similar to how chained comparisons are being rejected)\n\nThe other option would be to disallow lambdas from appearing as left-hand-operand of a binary operator (just like we already disallow blocks in such a position).\n",
