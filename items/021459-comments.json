While a few relatively core methods like this one are indeed still unstable, I stand by the claim in the blog post: we have made a huge effort leading into the alpha to stabilize the core modules, but that does not mean that literally every method is `#[stable]`.\n\nIn the near future we plan to break up unstable warnings into major \"feature\" areas, which will make it easier to track and get feedback on such stragglers.\n",
