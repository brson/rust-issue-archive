    "body": "@thestinger I don't think the README, as currently is, explicitly claims that non-\"tier 1\" platforms are not supported at all. Rather it is more like a different level of support, such that (say) we are willing to support Windows Vista but do not regularly test the master on it. We do not mention such \"tier 2\" platforms currently, which in my opinion should be made explicit at some point.\n\nAs a side note, you said the consensus and the consensus needs to be verified. I couldn't find any explicit decision to drop support for Windows XP in any of rust-dev archives (via Gmane), #rust and #rust-internals archives (via botbot.me) and Github issues. What I _could_ found was as follows:\n- In #10479 and #11003, @alexcrichton seems to know nothing about the decision.\n- In #10574 and several conversations on IRC, you (@thestinger) are strongly against the support for Windows XP due to the lack of native condition variables.\n- #4303 (2012-12) and #9618 are created by users that are using Windows XP at least sparingly.\n- In the rust-dev archives for the past year, there seems to be at least [one person](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-September/005818.html) that uses Windows XP.\n- [Botbot.me search on #rust](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust/search/?q=xp) also shows handful people using Windows XP (2014-01-20, 2014-01-05, 2013-08-07, 2013-07-11 to name a few).\n- In IRC, @brson said he [personally does not care about XP](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust/msg/8011913/) but noted that Firefox still supports it and XP is still widely used in Asia. Also @cmr [points out that XP still has 6.17% share on Steam](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-internals/msg/9231048/).\n\nIn light of this finding, I cannot say that there was a consensus at all. There are good reasons to support Windows XP (it will be around for some more years anyway) or not to support it (hurts the performance on newer platforms unless carefully engineered), but they are not the consensus.\n\nEdit: Okay, I forgot to search the meetings and I think I've found [some mention](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2014-01-07#wiki-should-we-support-xp-or-not) of the existence of \"tier 2\" platforms (and the fact that it includes Windows XP at the least).\n",
