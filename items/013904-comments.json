    "body": "I like this patch because it allows us to start porting code over ASAP. The biggest thing we gain is `Box<T>` where `T` is a type parameter like today, plus `Box<Trait>`. \n\nI am worried about `Box<str>` and `Box<[T]>`. I don't think we want to migrate to either of these types, but rather `Vec` and `Str`. I also believe that this decision needs to go through a meeting (just to make sure we're all on the same page).\n\nCould this patch be modified to deny `Box<str>` and `Box<[T]>`, while allowing `Box<Trait>` and `Box<T>`  (where T is a normal type parameter today, not a dynamically sized one)? I think that then we'll have all the forward-compatible syntax that we plan on keeping and using forever, without having a weird interim where everything is `Box<[T]>` when it should rather be `Vec<T>`\n",
