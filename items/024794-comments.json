    "body": "This is actually currently intentional! The `T: ?Sized` means that the `impl` block is maximally generic by default (we only have one). Each method then adds bounds as necessary, and in this case the `is_null` method currently requires that `T` is sized. \n\nAt the time this function was written, it was an ICE if `T` was not sized (hence `*const T` was a fat pointer). It is intended that one day that ICE and/or restriction will be lifted so this method will not have a `T: Sized` bound.\n",
