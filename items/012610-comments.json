But autoderef opens up some new fun so it'd also be good to have tests like:\n- Test a field reference that must autoderef to find the field\n- Test indexing that must autoderef to find the array\n- Test the case where the smart pointer defines a public field that is reached first\n- Test the case where the smart pointer defines a private field that is reached first (hmm)\n- Test the case where there are multiple methods to see which gets priority\n\nAlso, there is some discussion amongst the group about what the right semantics are in the face of method resolution ambiguity (ie, if both `*x` and `**x` define a method), but I think we'll land the patch now with your \"take the first thing you find\" approach and maybe as part of the method lookup rewrite that I'm working worry about alternative semantics.\n",
