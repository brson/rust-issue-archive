    "body": "See 3.5.1 of the System V Application Binary Interface - http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf\n\nIt's basically an optimization that allows you to avoid writing mov rax, 64bit-immediate for referencing symbols (which is that the large model does). However it places restrictions on where symbols can be in memory. The code model to use would be architecture specific and depend on the virtual size of binaries which in turn depends on the code model and an particular configuration. I don't think LLVM will always pick a suitable model, so I think this is better left as a command line option.\n",
