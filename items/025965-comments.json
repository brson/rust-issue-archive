The main thing I'm interested in pointing out in the docs is that \"UFCS\" syntax is not limited to function calls, but also works for associated types and constants. However, adding such a note to the UFCS chapter without changing the name seems to not work: if it's not limited to function calls, why introduce the 'UFCS' terminology?\n\nCould the chapter title be \"Lookup Disambiguation Syntax\" instead? Perhaps the chapter could still mention that in the case of function calls, the syntax is sometimes called UFCS.\n",
