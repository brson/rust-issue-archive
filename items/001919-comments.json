    "body": "The main issue is that there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get a directory listing without accidentally prepending the current directory to every entry returned. So currently, if I want to find the entries in a directory, I need to use fs::list_dir then slice off the section of the string dealing with the current directory. It's much easier to join two paths than it is to remove a path.\n\nIf I don't want to go about modifying the string that many times (fs::list_dir goes out of its way to prepend the directory name), my only current choice is to start messing around with opendir and readdir in native code. To do something as simple as listing a directory, I really shouldn't have to start messing around with pointers and unsafe code.\n",
