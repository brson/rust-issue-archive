You're right about `link_name` in the docs though.\n\nIn general, there appears to be very little documentation about rust's linkage model, and I would like to change that. I'm not sure where the best place for this documentation is. I would imagine it would be `doc/tutorial-linkage.md` because it doesn't really belong in the rust tutorial (except for a mention) and it doesn't really belong in the language manual (it's predominately not a language thing.\n\nThat being said, I'd like to verify that this is the direction that we wish to pursue before writing up that document.

    "body": "I have hit a snag in getting `make check` to pass. We have the following conundrum:\n- `libfoo` is only available in dynamic form, and hence links to `libstd` dynamically\n- Rust prefers static linking, hence links statically to `libstd`\n- When I build a program linking to `libfoo`, this generates two versions of the runtime\n\nThis is causing programs to crash because one runtime is initialized and the other isn't. This is a more general problem, however, as it doesn't only apply to libstd (anything using conditions would be affected).\n\nThis isn't a rust-specific problem, and in my experimentation with the linker I was unable to produce a binary which had the expected behavior. Additionally, this is a subset of the larger problem of guaranteeing that there is only one copy of a library in a final product. The compiler currently has no means to generate a dynamic library or executable with the guarantee that each upstream library will appear exactly once. We currently have this invariant because everything is linked dynamically, but this is not the case with static linking.\n\nWith this in mind, I do not believe that favoring static linking is the right thing to do at this time. I'm going to change this patch to require dynamic linking when creating a dynamic library, and add a `-Z prefer-static` for preferring static versions of a library when creating an executable. I will also for now print a warning stating the possible hazards of static linking an executable.\n\nI believe that we can work around this issue, but it requires more infrastructure than i believe that we possess today. I have not given this a large amount of thought, but all I can come up with is that this requires some complicated analysis which likely isn't worth it (this is \"just linking\" after all).\n\nI'm a little up in the air on whether to close this pull request because of this issue or not. I personally want to see this feature working in the compiler, but I'm uncomfortable with the amount of thought which I have put into this (I do not believe it is sufficiently enough). I will discuss this more and see what comes of it.\n",
