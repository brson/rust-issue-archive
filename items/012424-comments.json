    "body": "Quick comments:\n1. Is there evidence that this enables any sort of optimization for LLVM? Compile-time improvements? I am loathe to complicate trans in this way without good cause.\n2. I don't think that `Datum<Expr>` is a suitable type for the locals map. If we do want to do an optimization like this, I'd prefer to add a new sort of enum other than `Expr` that captures precisely what modes this stuff may be in. Keeping the story about cleanup straight is rather complex and the main goal of introducing a parameterized datum type was so that the type of things like the locals array told you everything you need to know.\n",
