    "body": "> When discussing #28921 the libs team decided to punt on isize/usize for now until a compelling use case came up, so I'm curious but do you have a use case in mind for these conversions?\n\nI mostly deal with networking protocols, and networking protocols frequently specify that certain quantities are 8 or 16 bits wide. For example., [the TLS 1.2 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) has several quantities defined as `uint16`. Several related protocols do likewise. I generally store such quantities as u16 in my code in order to document their range. (I would actually prefer a `uint_fast16_t` sometimes.) Like @petrochenkov, I am working on improving the type-safety of my code by eliminating uses of the Rust `as` operator, because `as` is too error-prone for safety-critical code. This is part of that effort.\n\n> Also guaranteeing that isize or usize is at least 16 bits is a language change that would need to go through an RFC most likely rather than just a PR here.\n\nI will post an RFC.\n\n> Conversions u32 -> usize are the most useful, but they are not included in this PR and should be guarded by cfg if we are going to encourage the AVR port.\n\nLike I mentioned, I purposely didn't include those because they are not AVR-compatible. Regardless, you are right that there is a need for a `widen` like you defined that works for `u32` and `i32`, for code that will never execute on a 16-bit platform. That includes lots of operating-system-specific code for IOS, Windows, and other platforms that don't support 16-bit systems. But, I think it would be best to do that separately, because I think it is not clear how to best support that. In particular, I definitely think it would be neat to design things in a way that encourages 16-bit-microcontroller-friendly code, but realistically a lot of developers just don't have the time or interest to deal with that.\n",
