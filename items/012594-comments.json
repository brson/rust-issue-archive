I am inclined to disagree with the latter: a very specific error message can and should be applied here, IMO.\n\nAnyway, the suggested lints are in metabug #3070 and more specifically #10304 and #7526 (a related issue).\n",

    "body": "Also PR #12300 will probably help with this (its basically the aforementioned capitalization lint).  Though I continue to think a more specific error check is warranted here.\n\n(In particular, automatic FFI binding generators will in general introduce names that do not fit our capitalization conventions.  My opinion is that we should not attempt to force binding generators to follow our conventions in all cases.  In a case like this, we can provide a better error message, e.g. via the strategy outlined in #4639.)\n",
