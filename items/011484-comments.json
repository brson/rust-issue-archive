When this gets merged I'll update the ticket to indicate that windows support is all that remains.\n\nWe're currently bringing the native I/O implementation up to par with the libuv-backed I/O implementation. For now I think it's a good idea to mirror libuv's api (at least in the stdlib for now). If the two use cases are fundamentally different, then I would like to explore other routes in order to have platform-specific I/O exposed from the standard library. For now, sticking to the existing traits should be \"good enough\"\n",
