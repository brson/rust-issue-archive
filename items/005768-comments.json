    "body": "When you say that 'on x86_64 linux, a stack will be lazily allocated page-by-page anyway' that would only be true if the main task ran on the main thread and used its stack (or possibly if it used a pthread's stack), which it does not. The thread's stack is used by the scheduler, not tasks, and no tasks even run on the main thread by default.\n\nWe could dedicate the main thread to the main task - it has been requested before - but it has a lot of consequences, making the main task 'special' in a number of ways (e.g. tasks that are expected to be on the main thread can never migrate to other threads, communication with the main task will have different performance characteristics than other general tasks). Personally, I like that there is no difference between the main task and any other task. It's consistent. It's also a little wasteful though since every program is guaranteed to have at least two threads.\n\nIf the only goal is to avoid allocating stack segments then I think a solution in which users can declare that a function requires a large stack is sufficient, or one where they call a closure that preallocates a large stack.\n\n```\n#[fixed_stack_segment]\nfn main() { }\n```\n",

    "body": "One of my friends is presently writing a kernel with rust, so I asked what he's doing to deal with this, and he said he's set `__morestack` to just fail. This could be an \"intermediate\" approach, as it doesn't save the speed of omitting function preludes, but it does save the allocation part. The other nice part of that is you get your canary automatically checked at each function call. So in addition to being able to omit the prelude when compiling (\"disabling the canary\"), you could opt to leave those in but use a runtime flag to disable the allocation.\n",
