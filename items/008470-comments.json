    "body": "I don't think that this is really an issue that's completely actionable. The best takeaway from this is \"make snapshots more often\". There are very real reasons I think why `make check-stage0-std` should break sometimes (while stage0 changes are being made).\n\nHopefully the windows in which `make check-stage0-std` is broken are fairly small, but I think that there's not much to do on this.\n",
