    "body": "In general, can you provide data to support a change such as this? The issue only claims that it may be an issue, I don't see any concrete numbers one way or the other. I'd like to see some analysis which compares the heap usage before and afterwards of projects like rustc (and perhaps servo) to see if a change such as this reaps the theoretical benefits.\n\nIn the past the code size generated by `format!` has often been the source of many problems in both servo, rustc, and benchmarks. Could you do some analysis to see what the impact is of passing size hints for all invocations of `format_args!`. This is inflating the amount of code generated for each invocation, as well as stack space used to store the local slice, so I'm a little worried if it's worth the benefits.\n",

    "body": "Note also that instead of changing the definition of `format!`, you could consider just changing the definition of `to_string` (while leaving the default method in `Show` itself).  Of course, the choice here largely depends on the tradeoff of adding more code to `format!` (and thus increasing its code size) versus getting the broader benefits of having `format!` produce a more precisely sized `String`.  I mention this largely as a way to try to semi-address @alexcrichton 's concerns.  (Though either way, it would still be best to have concrete numbers presented as well, and logged in the issue or PR.)\n",

This is something that can always be added backwards-compatibly later on, and I'd almost rather consider the stabilization of `Show` before considering optimizations like this (for what seems like only a small win?)\n",

    "body": "@pczarn, thanks for taking this on!\n\nI agree with @alexcrichton that, while this seems like a reasonable extension, it seems wise to resolve the basic question about the role of `Show` and its connection to `to_string` before adding this functionality. I plan to work on an RFC on this topic very soon and can incorporate this idea as part of the proposal -- maybe best to wait on landing this PR until the community has had a chance to evaluate the overall design space. (And, as @alexcrichton says, depending on the design it may be that a completely different strategy for solving this problem is needed.)\n\nI'll try to get a draft together in the next day or two, and ping you for feedback before posting it.\n",
