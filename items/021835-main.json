  "body": "This commit is an implementation of [RFC 576](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/576) which adds back the `std::io`\nmodule to the standard library. No functionality in `std::old_io` has been\ndeprecated just yet, and the new `std::io` module is behind the same `io`\nfeature gate.\n\nA good bit of functionality was copied over from `std::old_io`, but many tweaks\nwere required for the new method signatures. Behavior such as precisely when\nbuffered objects call to the underlying object may have been tweaked slightly in\nthe transition. All implementations were audited to use composition wherever\npossible. For example the custom `pos` and `cap` cursors in `BufReader` were\nremoved in favor of just using `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`.\n\nA few liberties were taken during this implementation which were not explicitly\nspelled out in the RFC:\n- The old `LineBufferedWriter` is now named `LineWriter`\n- The internal representation of `Error` now favors OS error codes (a\n  0-allocation path) and contains a `Box` for extra semantic data.\n- The io prelude currently reexports `Seek` as `NewSeek` to prevent conflicts\n  with the real prelude reexport of `old_io::Seek`\n- The `chars` method was moved from `BufReadExt` to `ReadExt`.\n- The `chars` iterator returns a custom error with a variant that explains that\n  the data was not valid UTF-8.\n",
