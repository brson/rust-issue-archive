    "body": "Actually, the return value from `sub` (and `equate`) ought to be ignored, as described...well, somewhere or other. I think the bug is in the `relate_with_variance` for `lub` etc. That said, it is probably wrong to return `result` here. It would be better to return `a` (which is also consistent with what the other `sub` cases do). That would probably fix `lub`, fwiw, but it still seems like it's wrong to return the result from `equate`. I guess it'd be better to say that `sub` always returns a subtype (i.e., `a`), if it does not yield an error. I don't think that introduces any particular difficulties to do. Similarly, `equate` can be defined to return `a` something that is equal.\n",
