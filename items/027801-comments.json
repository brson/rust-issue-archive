Perhaps it would be feasible to search `crates.io` for: either use of the `ip_addr` feature, or re-implementations of it?\n\nIt would surely be better if there were a single canonical implementation of `IpAddr`, though I guess it doesn't _have_ to be in `std::net` - some well-known crate would be pretty much as good.\n",

    "body": "I think `IpAddr` should be stabilized. I would note that it's not strictly true that no `std::net` interface accepts an `IpAddr`. `ToSocketAddrs` is implemented by `(IpAddr, u16)`, which is accepted by `TcpStream::connect`, `UdpSocket::bind`, and `UdpSocket::send_to`. I have found this to be useful for a program which performs name resolution ahead of time, often in an asynchronous manner. It is especially useful in the UDP case as one would typically not wish to resolve a hostname each time one sends a message. Therefore, I think that having a value with the notion of \"an IP address\" is a useful thing, even if it's not consumed by any **low-level** system APIs.\n\nIt is common, in my experience, for a userspace program to accept a hostname, resolve the hostname to either an IPv4 or IPv6 address and pass that address to one of the aforementioned `TcpStream` or `UdpSocket` methods. Such a program often does not care whether the address is IPv4 or IPv6 and forcing a program to deal with each of these variants only muddies the intent of the code.\n\nI also think that it doesn't particularly make sense to have DNS facilities in `std::net` return a `SocketAddr`. It's entirely possible that one is resolving a hostname for reasons other than to immediately open a connection on one of its ports. Returning an `IpAddr` from DNS methods makes far more sense, in my opinion. If one wishes to resolve a `\"hostname:port\"` string, the `ToSocketAddrs` trait exists for this reason.\n",

This means that this is purely a Rust abstraction, in which case it may not be appropriate for the standard library. If it's widely used, however, then it's pretty harmless and seems fine to me!\n",

Personally, the argument that \"libstd doesn't produce or consume these, so it should be removed\" doesn't hold much sway with me.   Since the concept of an \"IP Address\" is a stable and consistent across platforms, and the fact that there isn't a corresponding type in C are both arguments that suggest a path to stabilization.\n\nAlso, I wonder if including `IpAddr` in stdlib would help with compatibility among third-party modules (they could all deal with `IpAddr`s instead of building their own enum types)\n",

This is a case of many people finding a feature in the standard library useful and voicing their disapproval when it was removed.  I understand it was marked `unstable`, we were warned, &c.

There's no real maintenance burden here, the design is fine, and the community finds it valuable; let's ship it.\n\nI've opened a [PR to revert](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31438), which actually stabilizes the enum as of 1.7 (currently in beta). That will require a backport.\n",
