    "body": "As far as I can tell the structure you suggest isn't about eliminating 'blocking' per se - if there are events to be run then the loop doesn't block - but is a proposal to improve performance by using polling instead of events.\n\nFrom the description I believe that the performance win you expect to get here is from not using the idle callback. I'm skeptical that calling the idle callback is a significant amount of the work that the event loop is doing though. The work imposed by an idle callback on `uv_run` is the following (from loop-watcher.c):\n\n```\n  void uv__run_idle(uv_loop_t* loop) {                                      \\\n    uv_idle_t* h;                                                         \\\n    ngx_queue_t* q;                                                           \\\n    ngx_queue_foreach(q, &loop->idle_handles) {                             \\\n      h = ngx_queue_data(q, uv_idle_t, queue);                            \\\n      h->idle_cb(h, 0);                                                     \\\n    }                                                                         \\\n  } \n```\n\nThat is, traversing an element of a linked list and calling a function pointer.\n\nThis structure has a downside that it would impose more requirements on our generic event loop, and that it is more complicated.\n\nI'm not inclined to make this change without evidence that the current callback-based structure is a problem.\n",
