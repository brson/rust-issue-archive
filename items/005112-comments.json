    "body": "So you will need to be careful about situations like this:\n\n```\nconst X: int = Y[1024];\nconst Y: [int * Z] = [0, ..Z];\nconst Z: int = 1024 * 2;\n```\n\nHere the right order to evaluate the constants\u2014_and determine their types_\u2014is `Z`, `Y`, `X`. So we will need to actually typecheck \"just in time\", just before evaluating constants. We also need to intertwine constant evaluation and typechecking. So I think we need to do the following in the `collect` module in `typeck`:\n1. Build a dependency graph of constants. There is an edge between constants A and B if A contains a lexical reference to B. This can be done from the def_map.\n2. Topologically sort the dependency graph.\n3. For each constant C in the dependency graph, first `astconv` its type, then evaluate it.\n",

    "body": "I have to say the type `[int * FOO * 3]` looks really weird to me. I understand what it says, but having `*` mean two different things right next to each other just feels wrong. This could ultimately lead to someone writing:\n\n```\ntype foo = int;\nconst foo: foo = 3;\ntype bar = [foo * foo * foo];\n```\n\nEvil.\n\nThis feels like a good justification for an alternative syntax. Perhaps `[int .. FOO * 3]` to match the expression syntax. I'm not crazy about it but at least it'll be clear which portion is the type and which is the number.\n",
