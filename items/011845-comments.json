    "body": "According to [this description](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14388706/socket-options-so-reuseaddr-and-so-reuseport-how-do-they-differ-do-they-mean-t) I'd be wary of setting this option on windows as well. It looks like SO_REUSEADDR on windows essentially steals ports from any other application, which seems bad.\n\nOtherwise, my current understanding of SO_REUSEADDR for tcp sockets is such that this is a good thing. Taking notes out of libuv's book, it looks like we don't need to do much on windows at all, so I think it's fine to wrap this in a `if !cfg!(windows)` or something like that.\n\nAdditionally, I don't think that we should ignore the error from the `setsockopt` call, it should be processed like the other errors.\n\nThanks for doing this!\n",
