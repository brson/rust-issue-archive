    "body": "I really think we should consider converting some of these cases (especially in paths) into UTF-8, instead of treating them as binary and therefore unrepresentable as Rust strings.\n\nAs far as I know, the main case of lossy round-tripping through\u00a0Unicode is in SHIFT-JIS, and I don't even know if that lossy scenario affects real-world paths that happen to be encoded in SHIFT-JIS (the lossiness is because a MS extension created duplicates of conceptually the same character, which were then unified in Unicode. I don't know if that problem will end up mattering for paths).\n",
