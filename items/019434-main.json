  "body": "Tweaks the binary operator dispatch algorithm to not rely on the full resolution of the type of the LHS.\n\nCloses #8280\nCloses #19035\n\n---\n\nThis is an overview of the current type checking algorithm vs the new algorithm introduced in this PR:\n### Current\n- Check `lhs`\n  - (i.e. `check_expr(lhs)`)\n- Fully resolve the type of `lhs` (**compiler error** if can't fully resolve)\n  - (i.e. `lhs_ty = structurally_resolved_type(lhs)`)\n  - This is the cause of #8280\n- If `lhs_ty` is integer and `OP` is bit-shift\n  - Enforce that `rhs_ty` is a subtype of `uint`\n- Categorize `lhs_ty` and `OP`, if `lhs_ty OP lhs_ty` is a built-in operation\n  - (i.e. `is_binopable(lhs_ty, op)` returns true)\n  - This is the cause of #19035\n  - Watch out for SIMD comparison, make `rhs_ty` a subtype of `lhs_ty` and \"write\" the type of `lhs OP rhs` expression\n- Raise compile error if OP is `&&` or `||`\n- Otherwise operator is overloaded, proceed with trait dispatch\n### New (this PR)\n- Check _both_ `lhs` and `rhs`\n  - (i.e. `check_expr(lhs|rhs)`)\n- _Try_ to fully resolve `lhs` _and_ `rhs`\n- If both got fully resolved\n  - (i.e. iff both `try_structurally_resolved_type(lhs|rhs)` return `Some`)\n  - If _both_ `lhs_ty` and `rhs_ty` are integers and `OP` is bit-shift\n    - Enforce that `rhs_ty` is a subtype of `uint`\n  - Categorize `lhs_ty`, `rhs_ty` and `OP`, if `lhs_ty` _and_ `rhs_ty` have the same category and `lhs OP rhs` is a built-in operation\n    - (i.e. `is_builtin_binop(cx, lhs_ty, op)` returns true)\n    - Watch out for SIMD comparison and write type of `lhs OP rhs` expression\n- Raise compile error if OP is `&&` or `||`\n- Otherwise operator is overloaded, proceed with trait dispatch\n\n---\n\nThis PR passes `make check` as it is, but it comes with two new issues:\n- The \"reborrow adjustment\" trick we use to make `&'a T == &'b T` work even though only `&'a T == &'a T` (_note_ same lifetime `'a`) should work ... well, it no longer works (or it doesn't work in most cases). However, this is not a real problem, because with #19167 (overloaded `==` operator), we can now `impl PartialEq<&'b T> for &'a T` to take care references of with different lifetimes.\n- The most aggravating issue is an increase in the verbosity and decrease in the quality of the error messages related to binary operators. Consider the following code:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo;\n\n#[deriving(PartialEq)]\nstruct Bar(Foo);\n\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nWhich now generates the following error message:\n\n``` rust\nderiving.rs:4:12: 4:16 error: binary operation `==` cannot be applied to type `Foo`\nderiving.rs:4 struct Bar(Foo);\n                         ^~~~\nnote: in expansion of #[deriving]\nderiving.rs:3:1: 3:23 note: expansion site\nderiving.rs:4:12: 4:16 error: binary operation `&&` cannot be applied to type `bool`\nderiving.rs:4 struct Bar(Foo);\n                         ^~~~\nnote: in expansion of #[deriving]\nderiving.rs:3:1: 3:23 note: expansion site\nderiving.rs:4:12: 4:16 error: binary operation `==` cannot be applied to type `Foo`\nderiving.rs:4 struct Bar(Foo);\n                         ^~~~\nnote: in expansion of #[deriving]\nderiving.rs:3:1: 3:23 note: expansion site\nderiving.rs:4:12: 4:16 error: binary operation `!=` cannot be applied to type `Foo`\nderiving.rs:4 struct Bar(Foo);\n                         ^~~~\nnote: in expansion of #[deriving]\nderiving.rs:3:1: 3:23 note: expansion site\nderiving.rs:4:12: 4:16 \"\nderiving.rs:4 struct Bar(Foo);\n                         ^~~~\nnote: in expansion of #[deriving]\nderiving.rs:3:1: 3:23 note: expansion site\nderiving.rs:4:12: 4:16 error: binary operation `!=` cannot be applied to type `Foo`\nderiving.rs:4 struct Bar(Foo);\n                         ^~~~\nnote: in expansion of #[deriving]\nderiving.rs:3:1: 3:23 note: expansion site\nerror: aborting due to 6 previous errors\n```\n- The error message \"binary operation `==` cannot be applied to type `Foo`\" (and its `!=` brother) should appear only once.\n- The error message \"binary operation `==` cannot be applied to type `Foo`\", although it sounds absurd, it's actually a real error, just that the message it's bad. That message it's actually referring to the operation `bool && [Type Error]` where `[Type Error]` is the type of `Foo == Foo` (which can't be resolved, since `Foo` doesn't implement `PartialEq`).\n\n@nikomatsakis Thoughts? I think I can fix/improve the error messages, but I'd like to know what you think about the approach and whether the \"reborrow adjustment\" can/should be fixed or not.\n",
