The term heap should be completely removed from the documentation because it distracts from the high level semantics and doesn't actually have a basis in reality. Rust doesn't use the data section referred to as the heap (dss) for _either_ stacks or dynamic memory allocations. The dss section only exists for legacy reasons anyway.\n",

    "body": "@thestinger I confess I am somewhat confused. To me, the terms \"heap\" and \"stack\" have basically nothing to do with the source of the memory, and everything to do with the usage pattern of the memory. That is, the call stack refers to the big hunk of memory we reserve to store function activations. This is used according to a stack discipline (first in, last out).\n\nThe heap, in contrast, refers to memory that is allocated and freed in some other pattern that does not follow a stack discipline. That is, it is _not_ first in, last out. Naturally this requires a more complicated data structure to track what memory is free than a stack does. I don't believe that, in common usage, the word heap is specifically tied to the DSS segment (or any other).\n\nHeap vs stack seems like a useful distinction and one that is very meaningful to Rust. In particular, the stack is tied to the language in the form of lifetimes and so on. \n\nWhen you say \"in the documentation\", I guess you mean things like the guide and so forth? I can see the argument for being abstract in a language reference, but I think we are permitted some license in the tutorial. Being overly generic and abstract can make text quite hard to understand. All that said, I could believe that we can use the word \"box\" rather than \"heap\" in many places.\n",

    "body": "It can refer to the call stack and dynamic allocation, but referring to a _heap_ is neither clear or accurate. Pushing a stack frame onto the call stack isn't memory allocation, it's usage of a fixed amount of pre-allocated memory. It's comparable to pushing and popping from a vector. The memory allocated for the call stack is not any easier to track than memory allocated for a vector. In fact, I expect that both will end up using the same allocator code path in the future.\n\n> Heap vs stack seems like a useful distinction and one that is very meaningful to Rust. In particular, the stack is tied to the language in the form of lifetimes and so on.\n\nLifetimes are tied to the _call stack_, but that call stack is a high-level language concept managing memory spread out across registers, the current thread's call stack and other dynamically allocated memory like `Box<T>` and `Rc<T>`.\n",

    "body": "I haven't lived long enough to have off-hand references to historical usage, but \"heap\" is certainly frequently used to refer to any pool of memory from which dynamic allocations are carved out.  Using it to refer to some Linux section is a nonstandard and specialized meaning which can be useful, but has little chance of confusing anyone using Rust, especially on any other platform.  To wit: OS X frequently uses the term \"heap\" despite not having such a section.  [So does Windows.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366711%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)  [jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/wiki/Use-Case:-Heap-Profiling) and [tcmalloc](https://google-perftools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/heapprofile.html) refer to profiling the area of memory they manage as \"heap profiling\".  The term for overflowing a malloced buffer is [heap overflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_overflow).  Wikipedia's [memory management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#Dynamic_memory_allocation) article refers to any pool of memory used for allocation as \"the heap\".  Even the Linux kernel has a bunch of references to heap allocation from other heaps.\n\nFWIW, I have literally never heard of .dss, nor is what sbrk manages usually described as \"the heap\", see [one](http://linux.die.net/man/2/sbrk), [two](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/brk.html), [three](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/sbrk.2.html).  \n",
