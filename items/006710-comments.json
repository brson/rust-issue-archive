    "body": "@alexcrichton: dropping the equality check is definitely an improvement I can see in the IR for `TreeMap`, and `memmove` implies an overlap check (but LLVM was reducing it to one equality check).\n\nI doubt it would show up in benchmarks for most code, but it's a measurable little improvement for the tree balancing.\n\nFor very large objects, it would probably be helpful to expose alignment information to LLVM too, but I'll deal with that separately once this lands (we are always passing 1 as the alignment to `memcpy` and `memmove`).\n",
