    "body": "No, we're comparing the two ways to define wrapper structs. I.e. answering the question: if you need a wrapper type, how do you define it?\n\nIn Haskell, you have a choice between `data` and `newtype`; in Rust, you have a choice between `struct { }` and `struct ()`.\n\nWe currently only call the `()` version a \"newtype\" even though the `{}` version is essentially identical, and, in particular, the two are identical in terms of Haskell's difference between `data` and `newtype`, that is, we're coopting a Haskell word but just entirely ignoring the actual point of Haskell having two keywords. I would much prefer if we called both `{}` and `()` versions \"newtype\" or, preferably, \"wrappers\" (and then, e.g. \"tuple newtype\" or \"tuple wrappers\" for the `()` version).\n\nThis over-emphasis/preferential treatment of one-element tuple structs results in beginners writing code [like this](https://gist.github.com/cybergeek94/e06bc89cd0e1d654fdfb) (this is just an example of our misteachings, not picking on the code/author), where the person has unfortunately made life harder for themselves by using a tuple struct with all the ugly `let &Primes(ref primes) = self; primes.foo()` unwrapping, rather than just using a normal struct with a field access: `self.primes.foo()` .\n\n(This last ugliness point could easily be addressed by allowing some form of field accesses on tuple structs, but we don't have that now, and the preferential treatment of `()` would still be wrong.)\n",

And you're right, we only call the first one a \"newtype\". But we do that because we don't need a name for the second one, calling that one a \"struct\" works perfectly fine.

If you want to use the word \"newtype\" in connection with `struct Foo { x: T }`, I have no objection.\n\nI do agree that our current tutorial does suggest that `struct Foo(T)` is the right tool to use when you want a newtype, and that `struct Foo { x: T }` might be a better choice in many situations. And the guide here should probably be updated to reflect this. It's worth pointing out that a tuple-struct with a single field is a \"newtype\", but that it's also equivalent to a record-struct with a single field, and that the latter should be preferred in most cases. Personally, I think tuple structs are useful when the clients of your API can be expected to create these values, but rarely (or never) destructure them.\n",

    "body": "> newtype may be taught as an alternative to data, but that's only because the use-case of newtype is generally first introduced with data (that is, wrapping a single underlying type in a brand new type).\n\nThis doesn't really make sense... of _course_ `newtype` is introduced with `data`, since `data` is the general data type defining word in Haskell, i.e. it does `struct` and `enum` all in one. It is not possible to define a wrapper type without using `data` or `newtype` (just like you need to use `struct` (or `enum`) in Rust), so introducing `newtype` is essentially always going to be \"you can use `newtype` as a way to define wrapper types without the overhead of `data`\", since that's exactly what it is. (You could introduce `newtype` as completely separate \"this is how you define wrapper types\" construct, but that's strange: there's far more similarity between `data` and `newtype` than there are differences.)\n\nIn Rust, both `()` and `{}` are zero-overhead, so we don't need a special keyword for it, and I'm contesting our use of the special terminology should be generalised to cover the two equivalent definitions.\n\n> Strictly speaking, Haskell's newtype is equivalent in Rust to both struct Foo(T) and struct Foo { x: T }.

The first sentence is exactly what I have been saying, and then you're trying to justify why Haskell has `newtype` as a keyword? Neither of those are under question.\n\n> I think it's perfectly reasonable to call struct Foo { x: T } a \"newtype\" if you want, it just generally isn't done because nobody questions a single-field struct\n\nBut \"nobody\" thinks of using a single-field struct, because we use special terminology for the single field tuple version, and ignore the normal version.\n\n> Personally, I think tuple structs are useful when the clients of your API can be expected to create these values, but rarely (or never) destructure them.\n\nI wasn't saying they are useless, just that we're emphasising them too much by using a fancy name from another language where it has important meaning that is irrelevant to Rust.\n",
