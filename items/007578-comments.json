There are also points in the code right now which rely on the fact that reserve succeeds if it returns (grep for `set_len` in str.rs and almost all of them are preceded by a `reserve`).\n\nFurthermore, even if the overflow check failed, there's still the abort which happens if rust fails to allocate memory (which is the more likely scenario anyway).\n",

    "body": "@thestinger: agreed. This is especially important for optimized FFI functions, when you want to malloc a block of memory without initializing it with vec::reserve, pass it to an external function, then set the length. It's ugly, but important in a couple circumstances. So reserve can't just be a hint, it needs to allocate all the space requested or fail in some manner.\n",
