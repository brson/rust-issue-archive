I have a few concerns with this approach, however:\n- Is there a reason that you only applied this to `UnixStream` instead of `TcpStream` as well?\n- I'm not sure this truly detects usage such as this at compile time. Can't you continuously close the read/write halves, getting back the other half?\n- The timeout support for I/O objects will likely be either overhauled or `#[experimental]` after stabilization occurs, so it may be best to hold off on tweaking the design to that point.\n",

Calling `close_read` on a `UnixStream` returns a `UnixWriteStream`. After you've done that, you can call `close_write` on the `UnixWriteStream`, but then you get back a `()` - see lines 96 and 97: `impl WriteStream<()> for UnixWriteStream { fn close_write(self) -> IoResult<()> {`.\n\nQ: Should we hold off due to timeout issues?\n\nA: I suspect this change and any timeout changes would interact in a commutative and rather mechanical way, not requiring much thought.\n",

    "body": "Ah I see how it work! I got lost in the trait impls, clever though!\n\nThis does have the unfortunate drawback that the API of `UnixStream` must be duplicated among the stream, reader, and writer handles. The API as-is today is quite small, but you may find that `TcpStream` has a much larger api to tweak various settings. I would also expect `UnixStream`'s API to grow over time.\n\nIt may be best to punt this sort of static guarantee to an application writer rather than the standard library itself. I personally expect the `close_foo` methods to be callable if the stream were, for example, stored in a structure. Requiring consumption means that the field has to be moved in and out with an `Option`, for example.\n",

A quick grep show this is also the case with\n- `GenericPath::into_vec`\n- `UdpStream::disconnect` (which gives back a `UdpSocket`)\n- `TmpDir::unwrap` (which gives back a `Path`)\n- several functions on `Result`s (`and_then`, `err`, `ok`, `map`, etc.)\n- `EmptyBucket::put` (which returns a `FullBucket`)\n- `TaskBuilder::{try,try_future}` (which give back `Result` and `Future`)\n",

This is how the builder API is designed for `TaskBuilder`.\n\nHere this is just an I/O operation which does not actually need to consume the stream by any means.\n",
