    "body": "This looks really good! ... But I've got a few nitpicks:\n\nThere are several instances of `~[]` vectors that can and should be fixed length. E.g. for `Sha1`, `work_buf` should use a fixed length vector i.e. in the type declaration: `[u32, .. WORK_BUF_LEN]` (without any `~`'s), and when initialising it `[0, .. WORK_BUF_LEN]`. Similarly for `msg_block` and `h`. (As an example [the IsaacRng in `rand.rs`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/rand.rs#L602)).\n\nLastly, the `new` functions should return non-boxed values (i.e. `Sha1` instead of `~Sha1`). No need to force an allocation when the consumer doesn't necessarily want one, and if they do want one then `~Sha1::new()` should be fine.\n\n(Also, the convention is for static constants to be uppercase.)\n",

    "body": "I've implemented almost all of the changes mentioned by reviewers above and also modified the Digest trait to so that its possible to calculate a digest value without any heap allocation. The only change I didn't implement was to use default methods. When I tried to do that, I ended up getting the error:\n\nrust/src/libextra/workcache.rs:253:4: 253:37 error: internal compiler error: method not found in AST map?!\nrust/src/libextra/workcache.rs:253     (_sha).input_str(json_encode(t));\n                                                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nmake: *_\\* [x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage0/test/extratest-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu] Error 101\n\nwhich makes me think that there might still be some bugs remaining in the default methods implementation. I don't have a simple test case for that issue, but I can make a branch available that triggers it if desired.\n\nI think there is some room for extracting out the common code for the SHA-256 and SHA-512 implementations into a some sort of generic structure. It would be even better if that generic structure could support other block based digests. However, I tried to do this a couple of times and kept running into the same issue: although the algorithms are very similar they contain enough small differences that its harder to do this than I'd thought it would be. My thinking is that it might be easier to try to handle this as part of an MD-5, SHA-3, or some other digest implementation since I don't know enough about how those digests work to feel all that confident that I'd be able to create a generic structure that would handle them right now. Anyway, as long as the Digest trait's definition is solid, changing the implementation shouldn't end up breaking any code.\n",
