  "body": "Non-exhaustive change list:\n- `self` is now present in argument lists (modulo type-checking code I don't trust myself to refactor)\n- methods have the same calling convention as bare functions (including the self argument)\n- the env param is gone from all bare functions (and methods), only used by closures and `proc`s\n- bare functions can only be coerced to closures and `proc`s if they are statically resolved, as they now require creating a wrapper specific to that function, to avoid indirect wrappers (equivalent to `impl<..Args, Ret> Fn<..Args, Ret> for fn(..Args) -> Ret`) that might not be optimizable by LLVM and don't work for `proc`s\n- refactored some `trans::closure` code, leading to the removal of `trans::glue::make_free_glue` and `ty_opaque_closure_ptr`\n",
