    "body": "@nicolasboulay my thinking was that the function call sites would use be a macro invocation that would expand into the code for allocating and passing along the state you want.\n\nBut this may not be as easy as I originally thought, since I hadn't considered how to allocate the per-call-site storage.  (Also, I'm not familiar with Lustre, so I might be misinterpreting what your feature request actually is.  You may want to consider providing a bit more information, i.e. a concrete example of a piece of code showing how you'd be forced to write X today, and how you would write X after adding this feature.)\n\nAs for your question, the macro system is still a volatile feature of rust.  There is `macro_rules!` for doing macro-by-example that is sort of like Scheme `syntax-rules` style macros.  There is also a procedural macro system that landed recently (#11151) that I am less familiar with.\n",

    "body": "I have done a little reading on Lustre, which is a dataflow language. It does not have functions as such, but rather 'nodes' that can store some local variables as well as the previous values of parameters and outputs. Data is not local to the call site as such, but rather to the node in the graph. (http://rw4.cs.uni-saarland.de/teaching/esd07/papers/lustre.pdf)\n\nAs such, it should be relatively straightforward (if tedious) to achieve a similar effect by making a struct with the desired data, and making a method on that. As long as there are no cycles, calls to other nodes can be represented by nesting structs.\n\n@alexcrichton, it is not what you thought it was, but I am not sure it is anything that needs to be specifically added to Rust.\n",
