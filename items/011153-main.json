  "body": "Before this patch there was no ability to link to both libnative and libgreen\nand specify which should be used to boot the main function. This commit moves\nthis logic into a #[boot] attribute which can allow control over this. The\nchanges made are:\n1. The lang_start function is moved back into libstd with the signature:\n   fn(*u8, *u8, int, *u8) or (main, boot, argc, argv)\n2. Functions can now be tagged with #[boot] to indicate that the function can be\n   used to boot a rust crate. This boot function is serialized to metadata.\n3. Imports of external modules can also be tagged with #[boot] to indicate that\n   the crate's boot-function should be used to boot the runtime\n4. Only one #[boot] function/crate is allowed in an executable, more than one is\n   an error (along with zero as well).\n5. The compiler will automatically inject '#[boot] extern mod green;' for now,\n   this can be overrided with #[no_boot].\n\nWith this new attribute, control over how a crate boots can be fine-tuned per\nexecutable and libraries can specify arbitrary boot functions. The boot function\nis purely responsible for dictating what context the 'main' function is run in,\nruntime initialization via rt::init is not the responsibility of the boot\nfunction. Finally, the boot function is also responsible for blocking until all\nrust tasks have exited.\n",
