  "body": "I've found that unused imports can often start cluttering a project after a long time, and it's very useful to keep them under control. I don't like how Go forces a compiler error by default and it can't be changed, but I certainly want to know about them so I think that a warn is a good default.\n\nNow that the `unused_imports` lint option is a bit smarter, I think it's possible to change the default level to warn. This commit also removes all unused imports throughout the compiler and libraries (500+).\n\nThe only odd things that I ran into were that some `use` statements had to have `#[cfg(notest)]` or `#[cfg(test)]` based on where they were. The ones with `notest` were mostly in core for modules like `cmp` whereas `cfg(test)` was for tests that weren't part of a normal `mod test` module. \n",
