    "body": "@djrollins note that I only _think_ that this should be an easy task, I don't have enough experience with the compiler to _know_ that it's easy. :) Theoretically you should only need to find where the compiler is printing that specific error message, then add a \"note\" when the type mentioned in the error message implements any of `Fn`, `FnMut`, or `FnOnce`. You can look at many other error messages to see examples of \"notes\" being generated. Figuring out whether or not the type implements any of the Fn traits is probably going to be the trickiest part, because I'm not sure whether we have a convenient API to determine that for an arbitrary type. As a start you could merely implement the note _only_ for bare functions (the `fn()` types) since they're always callable, though I'm not sure if it's _actually_ any easier to distinguish `fn` from normal types compared to just looking up whether a type implements any of the callable traits.\n\nFor any compiler hacking, I'd recommend joining the #rust-internals IRC channel and casting around in there as you think of questions. That's also probably the best place to find a mentor. Good luck! :)\n",
