  "body": "This has travis build LLVM and rustc up to stage1, but not run any tests. It seems wasteful to have the ultimate might of travis running on every PR just to check for whitespace errors. This is a pure subset of the bootstrap, so it shouldn't ever spuriously break.\n\n`make tidy` still runs first, so we still get \"fast errors\" on bad style. However once make tidy passes, the build will simply keep running to try to make rustc. `tidy` takes ~3 mins to complete, so if your build runs longer you can be confident we've gone on to build LLVM/rustc. In principle this is configured to use ccache (it shows up in the build logs as uploaded/downloaded), but I found no actual performance changes in using it. \n\nMaybe someone at @travis-ci knows what's up with that.\n\nFor reference, here is a successful build with ccache enabled: https://travis-ci.org/Gankro/rust/builds/70821237\n\nand one without: https://travis-ci.org/Gankro/rust/builds/70812814\n\nBuilds seem to take about 41mins regardless.\n\nr? @alexcrichton \n",
