    "body": "`*x` and `&*x` both work as expected, and I've figured that `DerefMut` would only be used by an explicit dereference in a limited set of contexts: `&mut *x`, `*x = y` and `*x OP= y`, all of which are easy to detect in `typeck`.\n\nBut then there's `record_candidate_traits_for_expr_if_necessary` in resolve, which assigns one lang-item trait per overloadable expression, so I would have to implement the `DerefImm`/`DerefMut` choosing logic there and that doesn't seem right to me.\n\nOh, and how could #12402 happen while I can't seem to call a method on the right trait (if it's not in `trait_map`), which is also in the prelude? I'm a bit confused.\n\n**EDIT**: I didn't realize it at first, but `trait_map` holds a vector for each entry, so I can have both `DerefImm` and `DerefMut` available (not that we should do this in resolve, but I don't want to fix #12402 right now).\n",

I'm envisioning a type which either modifies a `static mut` each time the deref vs deref_mut method is called, or perhaps has a `Rc<Cell<int>>`, something like that.
