    "body": "Bug in the new typechecker and/or resolver; I'll fix that part. It should trap earlier.\n\nHowever, this is also a language non-feature (at present). Currently there's no mechanism for self-dispatch inside an object, either implicitly as you're doing, or via this.get(). There's no 'this' binding at all. It's not a ton of work to add, I've been hesitant to see if (a) it's necessary and (b) it will interact with whatever mechanism gets adopted for ad-hoc object extension / method replacement, which we haven't settled on yet.\n\nAnd I was also curious to see how far we could get without the feature. In general I only wish to adopt OO features \"one at a time\" as seems necessary, and stick to the minimum. The \"class\" concept in many OO languages is the semantic dumping ground of every language feature ever, and I don't want to wind up in that boat.\n",
