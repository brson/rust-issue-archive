    "body": "Both syntaxes are now invalid. You have two options: as lexemes \"32u32 - 1u32\", or as an expression \"32-1 as u32\". The \"as\" operator is low enough precedence that this doesn't require parens here.\n\nWe currently do no constant propagation or folding (there was a parser hack that attempted to do negation-folding on constants, but it was really awful and I've removed it), so both versions involve runtime arithmetic. A clever version of the compiler will fold it all away (and/or LLVM may just do so automatically).\n",
