    "body": "An even smaller program that exhibits the same bug:\n\n```\nfn f(x:int) {\n    const child: int = x + 1;\n}\n\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nThe problem is that this isn't an acceptable RHS for a constant, as in your example as well. But, constant checking happens _after_ typechecking. The typechecker, though, assumes constants don't refer to things like `self` or args. This is a bad assumption to make. To fix this, either we have to pass a function context to checking nested consts, or check constants before typechecking (constant checking uses some tables generated by the typechecker, though). It's a pain either way. But should be fixed.\n",
