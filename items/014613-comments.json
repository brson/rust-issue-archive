Theoretically both of these can just be iterator adaptors, that is\n\n``` rust\nfn from_utf16<I: Iterator<u16>>(it: I) -> FromUtf16<I> { ... }\nfn to_utf16<I: Iterator<char>>(it: I) -> ToUtf16<I> { ... }\n\nimpl<I: Iterator<u16>> Iterator<char> for FromUtf16<I> { ... }\nimpl<I: Iterator<char>> Iterator<u16> for ToUtf16<I> { ... }\n```\n\nand this would then be called like `to_utf16(string.chars())`.

I've changed all occurrences of `to_utf16` to `utf16_iter` and I hope I got it right...\n\n@huonw r? Sorry for spamming about this, didn't anticipate the libnative errors...\n",
