    "body": "Overall I think this is fine to include, although we're starting to get a fair number of encodings into libextra. I think that go's organization is nice with an `encoding` super-package, so perhaps we want to start moving things into:\n- `encoding/json`\n- `encoding/base64`\n- `encoding/hex`\n\nAnd then all future encodings can be thrown into there as well. Another thing which I think would be nice is to have a unifying trait for encoding/decoding things to/from types. I'm not quite sure how that would look, but it'd be a shame if we had different traits for all the encodings. One possible route would be for things like json/xml to implement the `serialize::{Encoder, Decoder}` and for things like base64/base32/hex to only convert between bytes and strings.\n\nRegardless, I think that we should get another opinion on whether this should be included in libextra (I'm in favor), and if there's any sort of reorganization of encodings it should happen on the mailing list/issue list and not here.\n",
