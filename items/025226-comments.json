    "body": "The prime reason for `struct.` or `fn.` prefixes is that Rust has two distinct namespaces. For example:\n\n``` rust\npub fn foo() {}\npub type foo = usize;\n```\n\n...would give two pages `fn.foo.html` and `type.foo.html` with distinct contents. It might still be possible to have a disambiguation page named `foo.html` which can be a simple redirect when there is no ambiguity. I'm less sure about another option, namely, to redirect `<shortty>.foo.html` to `foo.html`, but it will still work if the external crate always links to the full (but possibly non-canonical) URL.\n",
