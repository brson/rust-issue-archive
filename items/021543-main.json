  "body": "In preparation for the I/O rejuvination of the standard library, this commit\nrenames the current `io` module to `old_io` in order to make room for the new\nI/O modules. It is expected that the I/O RFCs will land incrementally over time\ninstead of all at once, and this provides a fresh clean path for new modules to\nenter into as well as guaranteeing that all old infrastructure will remain in\nplace for some time.\n\nAs each `old_io` module is replaced it will be deprecated in-place for new\nstructures in `std::{io, fs, net}` (as appropriate).\n\nThis commit does _not_ leave a reexport of `old_io as io` as the deprecation\nlint does not currently warn on this form of use. This is quite a large breaking\nchange for all imports in existing code, but all functionality is retained\nprecisely as-is and path statements simply need to be renamed from `io` to\n`old_io`.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
