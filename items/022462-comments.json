    "body": "We don't have hygiene for items at all.  There's no way to resolve item definitions at the macro definition site, therefore something as simple as\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! foo {\n    () => (None);\n}\n```\n\nis un-hygienically capturing an item from the invocation's environment.  This might be tolerable if it could not interfere with local bindings, but your example demonstrates this is not the case.\n\nThe problem here is that `let x = ...` can be either a definition or a use of `x`, depending on whether there's a `const` or `static` named `x`.  This is pretty terrible, imo.  This macro breakage only further illustrates the wisdom of distinguishing variables in patterns from structural matching (enum constructors, tuple structs, and const/static).\n\nRust uses capitalization for this distinction, but only by convention, not as part of the language.  Perhaps there is a minimally-invasive way to enshrine the convention, just within the pattern grammar, where it seems most needed.  More thoughts on this soon.\n",

You can also envision programs like the following:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo() {}\n\nmacro_rules! invoke_foo(\n    () => (foo())\n);\n\nfn main() {\n    fn foo() { panic!(\":(\"); }\n    invoke_foo!();\n}\n```\n\nand so I think the lack of hygiene for items is going to be problematic in other ways anyway.\n\nAs a user I don't necessarily mind your example not working as much as I think the diagnostic could be improved. I think even in the general case when you intend to use a binding as a catch-all pattern but it gets resolved to an item, we could be more precise and have\n\n```\nnon-exhaustive patterns: `_` not covered`\n```\n\nbe followed with a help note\n\n```\nperhaps you meant `x` to be a binding rather than a constant value pattern\n```\n",

    "body": "Although it doesn't work today, I think we could accept `x @ _` as unambiguous syntax for a variable binding, even when a const or an enum constructor named `x` happens to be in scope.  It's tolerable, though pretty disappointing, to say that wildcards in `match` in macros should use `x @ _`.  In fact we could write a lint for this \u2014 not by parsing `macro_rules!` definitions directly, but by walking the expanded AST and looking at every `match` that came out of a macro invocation.  The main point of this lint is to move the error closer to the macro author, ideally into their test suite.  Otherwise it's the unlucky user with a clashing `const` who gets a baffling error.\n\nOn the other hand I don't think\n\n``` rust\nlet x @ _ = ...\n```\n\nis an acceptable solution.  `let` bindings are much more common than wildcard arms.  And they're kind of the main point of macro hygiene.  A `let` pattern is irrefutable, which means there's not much use for matching a `const` or a nullary enum constructor.  Therefore, we could say that a bare ident as an irrefutable pattern is _always_ a variable.  This solves the hygiene problem, at the cost of making the pattern grammar less obvious.\n\nI should reiterate that my preferred solution is a syntax change which makes _all_ patterns locally unambiguous \u2014 probably by inferring from case, with explicit fallbacks like `x @ _`.  However it is a scary change to make at this late hour.\n",
