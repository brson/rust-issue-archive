This looks pretty awesome, however, and I would love to see this implemented!\n\nSome thoughts that may affect the writeup of the RFC:\n- How does this interact with hygiene? What scope are the identifiers created bound to, can they reference local variables for example?\n- How does this interact with our grammar? Are there ambiguities allowing macros as idents? If we one day allow for invoke macros via paths, this may require infinite lookahead to determine if an ident is a macro invocation (when used as an expression). This may not be super-relevant, however (just something to think about).\n\nThere may be other concerns, but I'm sure an RFC would flesh them out!\n",

Deviations into `bar!(foo, a = 5)` are unacceptable, and `foo.(bar!(a = 5))` are unfortunate.\n",
