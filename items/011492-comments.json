    "body": "Thanks, that's fixed up those problems\u2014but after trying it I still find myself unhappy, partly because I didn't think through all the implications (and didn't try it before):\n1. In suggesting `map` rather than `nmap` (`noremap` rather than `nnoremap`) I had been expecting normal, visual and operator-pending modes to all work; I hadn't thought this through: because of it chaining together a couple of things it actually won't be correct for operator pending mode (`d[[` becomes equivalent to `d?{<CR>w99[{`, which is certainly not what was intended). I'm not certain of the best solution here, but it's bound up in the next matter:\n2. Because it's using `?` it hijacks the search register (`\"/`) which is rather nasty behaviour.\n3. When I press `[[`, the last position (<code>``</code>) should be set to the present cursor location. This does not happen.\n4. It ends up quite a slow operation, especially if `'hlsearch'` is on.\n\nI'll see if I can figure a way to fix up these issues.\n",

Actual behaviour (the more logical and consistent, in my opinion): up to the start of the next outermost curly brace.\n- With folding enabled (`set fdm=syntax`), `[[` and `]]` do not behave as they should: the default behaviour treats an entire closed fold as one line for these purposes while this code does not (I explicitly `set nofoldenable` in the function\u2014the side-effects are worse with folds enabled), leading to unexpected behaviour, the worst of which is `[[` and/or `]]` not working in visual mode on a closed fold (visual mode keeps it at the extreme end of the region  line of the folded region, so it's always going back to the opening line of that fold and immediately being shoved back to the end by visual mode).\n- `[[` and `]]` are operating inside comments, whereas the standard behaviour skips comments.\n",
