    "body": "The primary blocker to giving names to tuple struct fields is that `rustc::middle::ty::ctxt::is_tuple_struct()` assumes that a field must be part of a tuple struct if its name is `\"<unnamed_field>\"`.\n\nOne solution I can see is to add a new field to `struct FieldTy`, `pub is_unnamed: bool` (bikeshedding welcome), which is set when the `FieldTy` is constructed from `ast::StructField_` in `rustc_typeck::convert_field`, setting it to `true` if `StructField_::kind == UnnamedField`. Then, `is_tuple_struct()` can just check the value of that `bool`, ~~which also might be a small performance win in eliminating a pointer indirection and a string-equality check in a linear algorithm~~ (I just realized it's only comparing the interned string IDs, not the strings themselves).\n\nWith that refactored, we could create a name based on the field's index and/or type, and print that to point users towards the culprit in their code.\n\nHowever, a less intrusive change would be to leave the naming semantics as-is, but change `\"<unnamed_field>\"` to something less debug-looking, like `\"(unnamed field)\"`, then add @apasel422's suggestion of pointing to the field's span in a `note:` printout. The `NodeId` for the field (to look up the span), or the span itself, can simply be returned from`ctxt::can_type_implement_copy()` in the `CopyImplementationError::FieldDoesNotImplementCopy` error value.\n\nThis approach would change less of the compiler's internals while being more informative for `Copy` impl errors on both regular and tuple-structs. \n\nHowever, the latter approach would not fix other occurrences of the uninformative `\"<unnamed_field>\"` besides making it look a little more presentable. I'm not exactly sure where else it comes up, so maybe those other occurrences should also have `note:` spanned printouts directing the user to the problem field instead of just telling them its index (which isn't as intuitive). \n\n@huonw, what would you recommend?\n",
