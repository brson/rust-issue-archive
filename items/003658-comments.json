I'd like to give this more bake time to see which parts are necessary, which parts overcomplex. We haven't written enough complex concurrent code yet to be clear on that yet. There are a lot of moderately-complex protocols I can imagine us wanting to have implementations for (those related to I/O, files, sockets, locks, databases, concurrency primitives) that it may be the best route for generating. Doesn't feel clear to me yet.\n",
