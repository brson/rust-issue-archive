    "body": "@kballard They are intentionally ignored. That function, as the name suggests, only detects warnings and errors. I consider `help` messages to be a different kind of \u2018note\u2019, and notes are ignored by default, so I chose to do the same thing for \u2018help\u2019 messages. If \u2018help\u2019 messages were not ignored, `//~ HELP` lines would have to be added _everywhere_ where an error with an explanation occurs. This would mean that in addition to the existing `//~ ERROR` pattern for detecting, for example, unreachable patterns, there\u2019d have to be a separate `//~ HELP` pattern for detecting the `pass `--explain E0001`` message, which is undesirable because more `//~ HELP` comments would have to be added each time an `--explain` message gets added.\n",
