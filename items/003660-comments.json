    "body": "Oh, that's interesting and unfortunate. I can see how that might happen, as those two directories are built by different rustc's during different stages of compilation. The exact reasoning is complicated, but we count on these two binaries being identical but there's a chance that they aren't because of bootstrapping problems. If we built all the way through stage3 it probably wouldn't be a problem, but I believe we stop at stage2 these days.\n\nI've rolled a new installer that uses a more recent snapshot and tested it here on Win7 and I don't see the problem with core having different sizes. Sadly I overwrote the one that was exhibiting this issue before testing it myself.\n\nhttp://dl.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.4-install.exe\n",
