    "body": "Here are the steps I follow on Windows. Feel free to use what I say here in the windows build instructions.\n1. Install mingw64 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/latest/download.\n   Make sure to specify threads=win32 architecture=i686 and exceptions=dwarf.\n   If you're trying to build using x64 rust then architecture=x86_64 and exceptions=seh.\n2. If you're trying to bootstrap rustc itself to work on the compiler/standard libraries, then install just the msys base system using mingw-get from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download.\n3. If you don't already have Git, then get it from http://msysgit.github.io/.\n4. If you're just using Rust then install Rust from http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-install.exe and then download Cargo from http://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-i686-pc-mingw32.tar.gz and extract it to where you installed Rust because it is just easier that way.\n5. When using Rust, open up `cmd.exe`, set your `PATH` to `<Rust>\\bin\\;<MinGW-w64>\\mingw32\\bin\\;<Git>\\bin\\;<other stuff>`, and use `cargo` and `rustc` to your heart's content.\n6. When building Rust, open up `cmd.exe`, set your `PATH` to `<MinGW>\\msys\\1.0\\bin\\;<MinGW-w64>\\mingw32\\bin\\;<MinGW-w64>\\mingw32\\opt\\bin\\;<Git>\\bin\\;<other stuff>`, followed by `sh configure` and then use `make` as you see fit. For x86_64 replace mingw32 in the PATH with mingw64 and do `sh configure --target=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --build=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32`.\n",

It is described in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Using-Rust-on-Windows. However when you need msys it will confuse you.

    "body": "(Note: I was the ungrateful bastard who complained on Reddit.)\n\n**Edit**: I realise there are various pages on contributing to Rust.  I haven't gone through these yet; I just wanted to make sure I put a note in this issue that I'm working on some changes to the docs to avoid anyone duplicating the effort.\n\nI've cloned the wiki and modified the information there to be unified and consistent.  I'm not sure what to pull on or whatever the process is.  If preferred, I can just copy+paste the changes into the wiki directly (it looks like I can edit it).  I did want to check in this issue first.\n\nCurrently, the changes redirect people visiting both \"Building Rust before 0.8 on Windows Systems\" and \"How to install an unofficial nightly for Windows\" to the current pages.  I removed the instructions on using Chocolatey, on the basis that there are official nightly builds.  I intend to see if there is still a way to do this, and will update accordingly.\n\nThe \"Using Rust on Windows\" page now explains the distinction between MinGW, MinGW-w64, MSYS, MSYS2 and Cygwin, why they are needed, what combinations are possible and how to make this all work.  The bolded recommendation on the page is \"MSYS2 with MinGW-w64\", with separate instructions on installing MinGW-w64 _outside_ of MSYS2.  There are also up-to-date instructions on installing and using MinGW and MSYS, since until I tried to compile Rust itself, I wasn't aware there was a problem.\n\nI will check the other official docs as well.  Should I put a note in `README.md` in the source noting the presence of a more thorough set of instructions on the wiki?  The wiki instructions are basically just more verbose and explicit than the `README.md` ones.\n",
