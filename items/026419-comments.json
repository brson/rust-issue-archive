    "body": "I implemented the approach of just storing the immediate parent and calculating the parent item on the fly. It basically has zero impact on compile times which strategy we use (averages over 3 runs):\n\nmaster: 10m8.3s\nstoring approach: 10m8.0s\ncalculating approach: 10m6.8s\n\nFor reference, over all runs the min was 10m0.775s and the max 10m13.389s. So the small differences above are basically just noise.\n\nI think I prefer the calculating approach - if speed is equal, then less memory is probably better. It feels slightly better too, although only slightly. I'll submit that as a new PR. Closing this one.\n",
