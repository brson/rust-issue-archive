  "body": "The compiler was updated to recognize that implementations for ty_uniq(..) are\nallowed if the Box lang item is located in the current crate. This enforces the\nidea that libcore cannot allocated, and moves all related trait implementations\nfrom libcore to libstd.\n\nThis is a breaking change in that the AnyOwnExt trait has moved from the any\nmodule to the owned module. Any previous users of std::any::AnyOwnExt should now\nuse std::owned::AnyOwnExt instead. This was done because the trait is intended\nfor Box traits and only Box traits.\n",
