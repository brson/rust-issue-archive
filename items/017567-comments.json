    "body": "This has a slightly different error message now (`int` or `()` give the same results):\n\n```\nfoo.rs:3:1: 3:22 error: unable to infer enough type information to locate the impl of the trait `core::kinds::Sized` for the type `<generic #0>`; type annotations required\nfoo.rs:3 impl<T> Tr for int {}\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nfoo.rs:3:1: 3:22 note: the trait `core::kinds::Sized` must be implemented because it is required by `Tr`\nfoo.rs:3 impl<T> Tr for int {}\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n```\n\nI'm not actually sure if this is wrong. We do require the `Sized` bound on `T` and there is not enough type information to infer it. Just because `T` is not used, doesn't mean its bounds don't have to be satisfied by the concrete type (`int`, here). It would be nicer to say `T` rather than `<generic #0>` in the error message, but otherwise I don't think this is a bug.\n\nPropose closing this issue. cc @nikomatsakis (since this is a trait reform thing)\n",
