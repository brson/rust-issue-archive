Disentangling rustc from rust is probably important in the long run, since rustc depends on several extra libraries outside the standard library (e.g. graphviz) that should not necessarily be versioned with the language. One difficulty that comes to mind is ensuring that the latest rustc is compatible with the latest rust, but this is manageable with continuous integration.\n\nAnd having `libstd` as a dependency of rustc might make sense from a cargo standpoint, assuming cargo can incorporate the snapshot/bootstrapping process.\n",
