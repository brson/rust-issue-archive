    "body": "@Gankro I haven't been able to dig up any notes just yet, but in general we're not willing to commit to any library in-tree at this time other than the standard library. As a result we have a large number of useful crates in-tree (such as all of these) which we would still like to provide. By providing these crates in crates.io we get a number of benefits:\n- All crates can be rapidly iterated on as necessary because development happens independently of the compiler.\n- Each crate can be used on the stable channel of Rust.\n- Distribution on crates.io means you don't have to wait for the next release of Rust to get bug fixes or new features from these libraries.\n\nNote that this is _not_ just removing these crates. We plan to continue officially supporting them in the `rust-lang` organization and fix bugs etc. When we have time to scrutinize their APIs we may be able to fast-forward them to 1.0 as well, and possibly even bring it back in tree, but until that time we need a way to retain all of this functionality in the stable channel of Rust at 1.0.\n",
