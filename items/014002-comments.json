But I hadn't considered extending this to something like `uint` and using it with `range()`. That's an interesting idea, but there's 2 major flaws I see:\n1. How do you actually specify the range? If I do `range(-1i, 10i)`, how do I get the Iterator to only cover that range (or at least, to start at `-1`)? I'd have to know the lower bound of the iterator and how many elements lie between that bound and my starting value.\n2. This is incompatible with ranging over floating-point numbers, which is currently supported.\n\nGiven that, I think `&'static [T]` is still the way to go.\n",

    "body": "> > How do you actually specify the range?\n> \n> Eq or Ord?\n\nWhat do you mean? The proposed `Enumerable` doesn't take any sort of range, and giving it a range defeats the original purpose of it (which is to enumerate all the values). For using it with `range()` you'd need to do something like `values().skip_while(|x| *x < start).take_while(|x *x < end)`, and that's not very nice (making an iterator on `int` skip 2 billion values? Yeah maybe it will inline, but I'd rather not _require_ inlining to have even slightly sane behavior).\n\nAs for floating-point, yes, ranging over floating-point numbers has some issues. But from a practical standpoint it's a lot nicer to support `range(1.5f32, 12)`.\n",
