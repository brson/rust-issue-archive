Unfortunately, as noted previously, we don't rely on Travis for guaranteeing a green build for Rust, and a green build on Travis does not necessarily have signal to whether the tree is currently green (it only runs a subset of the tests).\n\nAlso as mentioned, our builds on travis are not consistent as building rust is very resource intensive, and we frequently run into the timeout limits on what appears to be the lower end bots.\n\nFor these reasons, I'm going to close this for now.\n",
