  "body": "::num::bigint, Remove a source of O(n^2) running time in `fn shr_bits`.\n\nI'll cut to the chase: On my laptop, this brings the running time on\n`pidigits 2000` (from src/test/bench/shootout-pidigits.rs) from this:\n\n```\n% time ./pidigits 2000 > /dev/null\n\nreal    0m7.695s\nuser    0m7.690s\nsys 0m0.005s\n```\n\nto this:\n\n```\n% time ./pidigits 2000 > /dev/null\n\nreal    0m0.322s\nuser    0m0.318s\nsys 0m0.004s\n```\n\nThe previous code was building up a vector by repeatedly making a\nfresh copy for each element that was unshifted onto the front,\nyielding quadratic running time.  This fixes that by building up the\nvector in reverse order (pushing elements onto the end) and then\nreversing it.\n\n(Another option would be to build up a zero-initialized vector of the\ndesired length and then installing all of the shifted result elements\ninto their target index, but this was easier to hack up quickly, and\nyields the desired asymptotic improvement.  I have been thinking of\nadding a `vec::from_fn_rev` to handle this case, maybe I will try that\nthis weekend.)\n",
