  "body": "This commit stabilizes the platform-specific `io` modules, specifically around\nthe traits having to do with the raw representation of each object on each\nplatform.\n\nSpecifically, the following material was stabilized:\n- `AsRaw{Fd,Socket,Handle}`\n- `RawFd` (renamed from `Fd`)\n- `RawHandle` (renamed from `Handle`)\n- `RawSocket` (renamed from `Socket`)\n- `AsRaw{Fd,Socket,Handle}` implementations\n- `std::os::{unix, windows}::io`\n\nThe following material was added as `#[unstable]`:\n- `FromRaw{Fd,Socket,Handle}`\n- Implementations for various primitives\n\nThere are a number of future improvements that are possible to make to this\nmodule, but this should cover a good bit of functionality desired from these\nmodules for now. Some specific future additions may include:\n- `IntoRawXXX` traits to consume the raw representation and cancel the\n  auto-destructor.\n- `Fd`, `Socket`, and `Handle` abstractions that behave like Rust objects and\n  have nice methods for various syscalls.\n\nAt this time though, these are considered backwards-compatible extensions and\nwill not be stabilized at this time.\n\nThis commit is a breaking change due to the addition of `Raw` in from of the\ntype aliases in each of the platform-specific modules.\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
