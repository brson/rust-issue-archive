    "body": "I have a patchlet that fixes half of this -- the half of doing mangling and sanitizing in the wrong order. But there's another worse half that will be more work: any time we generate a symbol with the same name as another, LLVM silently renames it and appends a numeric suffix. This breaks mangling. We have to ... very carefully go through trans and ensure we never make duplicate names.\n\nI think that's worth splitting into a sub-bug and deferring. The major piece I'll land on this bug shortly.\n",
