  "body": "This un-reverts the reverts of the rusti commits made awhile back. These were reverted for an LLVM failure in rustpkg. I believe that this is not a problem with these commits, but rather that rustc is being used in parallel for rustpkg tests (in-process). This is not working yet (almost! see #7011), so I serialized all the tests to run one after another.\n\n@brson, I'm mainly just guessing as to the cause of the LLVM failures in rustpkg tests. I'm confident that running tests in parallel is more likely to be the problem than those commits I made.\n\nAdditionally, this fixes two recently reported issues with rusti.\n",
