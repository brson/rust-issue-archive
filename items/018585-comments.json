    "body": "Here are my current thoughts on this. Nothing is official of course, just a bunch of proposed strategies to deal with all these crates:\n\n## Facade crates we must ship\n- alloc\n- collections\n- core\n- libc\n- rustrt\n- sync\n- unicode\n- rand\n\nSuggested strategy: Disallow explicit `extern crate foo` to the crates via stability lints. The stability lint will look at `extern crate foo` and then inspect the crate attributes of the crate `foo` for stability lints to perform this check. This means that these crates can all be `#![experimental]`, disallowing access to them.\n\nOther suggestions:\n- we may wish to reserve these names in crates.io\n\n## Compiler implementation details we may want to ship somehow\n\nThis is a listing of crates which the compiler uses as implementation details. These apis are not in a state of which they should be stable, but they are quite useful to the community at large (many users!).\n- arena\n- log\n- term\n- time\n- getopts\n\nSuggested solution: Provide all of these crates officially through crates.io instead. Each crate will start with `#![cfg_attr(source_build, experimental)]`. This means that uploaded cargo packages will not be experimental, but published versions via the standard distribution (built with `--cfg source_build`) would be experimental. This means that to use the crates you will have to depend on the crates.io package, not the distributed package.\n\n## Crates tied to the compiler implementation itself\n\nThese crates cannot be modified without changing the compiler itself. Conversely, the compiler can never change because these crates are not changed in lockstep. The apis are not quite what we'd like to stabilize at this time, however.\n- test\n  - Very little API surface bound by librustc, in the worse case we can just add more surface area over time. \n  - Must be able to import `test::Bencher`, however, with the one method `iter` and the field `bytes`.\n- serialize\n  - The `Decodable` and `Encodable` traits are tied to the compiler's `deriving` implementation.\n\nSuggested solutions: \n- test: Ship an `#[experimental]` libtest (compiler injected `extern crate` statements to experimental crates are ok), but create `std::test` with `Bencher` inside of it. `Bencher` will become a trait instead of a struct.\n- serialize: Move `Decodable` and `Encodable` to the standard library, try to land @erickt's improvements before 1.0, and mark serialize as `#[experimental]`. Move the crate itself to cargo and require existing users to use the crate through cargo instead.\n\n## Misc crates\n- native\n\nThis crate will likely just be removed with rtio work\n\n## Crates we want to ship\n- std\n\nNo questions here!\n\n## Compiler implementation details we do not want to ship\n- flate\n- fmt_macros\n- graphviz\n- rbml\n- rustc\n- rustc_back\n- rustc_llvm\n- syntax\n- rustdoc\n\nSolution: flag all crates as `#[experimental]`, do not provide any of them in crates.io either.\n\n## Crates to should be removed from the rust repo\n- green\n- rlibc\n- regex\n- regex_macros\n\nI'm thinking of removing these entirely from the repository in favor of packages in crates.io. Each of these can be versioned speparately from the standard Rust distribution. Note that `regex_macros` won't be usable outside of the nightly channel of Rust.\n\n# TODO list\n- [x] Implement `extern crate` linting\n- [ ] Add `Cargo.toml` to the cargo crates above, publish them at crates.io when it's online.\n- [x] Remove libnative\n- [x] Remove libgreen\n- [x] Remove rlibc\n- [ ] Remove regex/regex_macros\n- [x] Ensure all crates are `#![experimental]` other than std (or `cfg_attr(experimental)`) depending on which one it is\n- [ ] Move `Bencher` to std\n- [ ] Move `Encodable` and `Decodable` to std\n",
