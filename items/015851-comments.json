    "body": "This is a bug in your own code; `Vec.insert(&mut self, index: uint, element: T)` is defined as something that will fail \u201cif `index` is not between `0` and the vector's length (both bounds inclusive).\u201d This means that your code will only run successfully if the four tasks are run in sequence; if they are not, the insert call fails and [the mutex is poisoned](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html#failure)\u2014once the task has failed, the mutex\u2019s integrity cannot be guaranteed.\n\nEverything is behaving as specified.\n",
