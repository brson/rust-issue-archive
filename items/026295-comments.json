    "body": "The error is correct. While there is indeed a borrow error there, `owned` is declared inside of a block, but you try to return it outside the block. This would still be a problem even if `owned` was a `Copy` type (e.g. `u32`). Local variables never outlive their defining block (you can move a value out of a local, but then it isn't that local variable anymore).\n",

    "body": "I mean, your code would still be broken even if you didn't move `owned` into the struct - the local won't outlive its block in any case (of course, the move makes the local's _value_ outlive the block, but that still won't help you of course).\n\nAnyway, the reason you hit the lifetime error first is because lifetimes are computed before borrow-checking is done. This is not going to change, because attempting to borrow-check code with invalid lifetimes tends to lead to error cascades.\n",
