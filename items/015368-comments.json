    "body": "@AdrianArroyoCalle As a Rust community member who tried Haiku a couple of years back, this is my perspective on adding Haiku as an officially supported target for Rust; While Haiku is interesting, it is immature and no one I know ever used it full-time outside of a virtual machine and I don't know of any Rust developers using it. Given that Rust itself is still under heavy development, (although 1.0 is nearing...), I would say it is unreasonable to ask the Rust developers for Haiku support at this time.\nIf you look at the README, it says that Windows, OSX and Linux are officially supported as of now.\nOne can compile Rust for *BSD but even that doesn't seem to be an officially supported environment and given that the BSDs have unquestionably larger user-base compared to Haiku...\n\nAn unofficial port however, would certainly be more than welcome, I just wouldn't ask for an official support as of yet.  \n",
