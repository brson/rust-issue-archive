    "body": "@graydon is probably the best to answer this, but I can take some guesses. Since pipe2 is linux-specific it should probably be in libc::funcs::extra, and O_CLOEXEC in libc::consts::extra. The code using them would need to be configured only for linux. All the C constants are currently just hardcoded for all platforms, so that's fine.\n\nSince this is a mac problem to, as indicated by the linked issues, I wonder if there are other ways to solve this.\n\nThe bool to FILE_reader should be true if you want the reader to close the fd when destroyed.\n",

    "body": "I think we should be using `posix_spawn` here. It will mean we have to set `CLOEXEC` instead of closing files after a `fork`, but we should be doing that anyway (`node.js` does this, so `libuv` might already be getting us most of the way there). I'm going to close this because we should have a cross-platform solution.\n",
