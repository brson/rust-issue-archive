    "body": "When the seek head is \"off\" the list, it's a bit ambiguous what insert/pop should do. For simplicity I will simply refer to the leftOfHead case, where the seeker points to \"before\" the first element. Here `insert_after` and `pop_after` seem obvious, they manipulate the head of the list. However, `insert_before` and `pop_before` are less clear. For `pop_before` it seemed reasonable to just yield `None`. For `insert_before` at the time of writing it made sense to just handle it the same as `insert_after`: append to the front of the list. However upon reflection this strikes me as potentially confusing, as it breaks some reasonable expectations of how you would expect `insert_before` to interact. Elements appear to the right of the seek head, even though they were inserted \"before\" it.\n",

    "body": "This is definitely useful functionality, sometimes known as a \"Cursor\", which likely will apply to other collections as well.\n\nI wonder whether, instead of introducing a separate notion of \"Seeker\", the mutating methods could be added directly to the mutable iterator for `DList`? Note that the `DList` iterators are already double-ended, which means you can peel off items from either end of the range (which means that immutable seekers are, I think, wholly redundant). Adding methods to `MutItems` would make this change more appealing by reducing duplication.\n",

    "body": "I wrote this in a _very_ conservative manner under the assumption we didn't want to undermine the current notion of DoubleEndedIterators \"consuming\" their range irreversibly. I'm not opposed to it, though; less different iteration objects is definitely an ergonomic win. \n\nHowever, it would definitely complicate Cursors. I designed cursors so that it's impossible to invalidate the value pointed to by the cursor, which makes them very easy to reason about. But with a double-ended cursor, you need to handle more edge cases about what happens when both heads are adjacent. Especially if you want to still have them work like DEI's. I suppose from the perspective of each cursor, the other represents the \"end\" of the list? You would get some awkward behaviour with immutable cursors where moving one cursor can change the logical \"value\" pointed to by the other (i.e. change it between None and Some).  You also have to decide what happens when you delete the node pointed to by a cursor. \n\nRegardless, most of the work is thankfully done regardless of how we proceed because of my refactoring.\n",
