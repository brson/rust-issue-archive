At the same time operator less ([std::cmp::PartialOrd](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html)) doesn't have such extra implementations (`i32 < &i32` and `&i32 < i32`) but they can probably be added for consistency.\n",

    "body": "The motivation to provide `i32: Sub<&i32>` (and similar) is because the arithmetic operators `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, etc take their arguments _by value_ and thus _consume_ them in _generic contexts_ (if you parameterize the arithmetic type) unless you require the type to be `Copy` as well. If you don't add the `Copy` bound but you want to reuse the arguments you would have to use `Clone`. But that would make the code less readable and may incur unnecessary costs for user-defined arithmetic types like extended precision floating point numbers, for example, which are presumably not `Copy` and more expensive to clone. So, for the sake of uniformity, arithmetic type providers should add non-consuming operator implementations so that you can rely on their presence in generic code to avoid unnecessary cloning. This includes the built-in types.\n\nHowever, the comparison operators and `PartialOrd` _don't_ consume their arguments. They are implicitly borrowed: `b < *aa` is equivalent to `PartialOrd::lt(&b, &*aa)`. So, in my opinion, it's less important to have `i32` implement `PartialOrd<&i32>` because you could just as well write `b < *aa` even in generic contexts without the `Copy` bound.\n",
