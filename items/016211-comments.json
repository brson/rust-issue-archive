    "body": "The `rust_fail` symbol itself is not inlined nor generic, so it does not cross the crate boundary. It lives in `librustrt` and will always live there regardless of how you link to it. Other symbols like `begin_unwind` are generic or may be inlined, meaning they may appear in the local crate (in addition to `librustrt`)\n\nChoosing how you link to the standard library (dynamic vs static) is not currently a fine-grained choice you can make. The compiler maximizes the number of dynamic libraries linked against if any library linked is a dynamic library, and because the standard library is distributed as a dynamic library it is linked against dynamically.\n\nCan you also give some more information about your setup, the exact contents of files, etc?
