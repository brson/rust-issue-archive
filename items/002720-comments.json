    "body": "Turns out this didn't actually fix the problem. At the time I had (wrongly) assumed that the Python version detected during Rust's configure phase was being somehow communicated to LLVM. Looking a bit more closely, I'm not sure that Rust does anything at all with the detected version of Python; perhaps an artifact of an era when Rust had a Python dependency?\n\nbbrittain (who rediscovered this bug) and I discussed some hacky workarounds and finally decided that the best thing to do is to send a patch upstream to LLVM (which, despite having a hard dependency on Python 2, never bothers to check for Python 3 and just fails with cryptic errors). Once the fix is accepted we can integrate it into Rust's fork of LLVM.\n",
