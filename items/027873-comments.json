However, there are cases when the `cfg`d code does compile, e.g. I encountered this in #27169 where I added an ABI and had to use it in `core` inside a `#[cfg(not(stage0))]` module. Similarly, if we add ABIs in future, someone might have code designed to compile with Rust 1.0.0, but can take advantage of the newer ABI if it is available.\n",

The code within the gated block is compiled only when a cargo feature is enabled; the code outside it works both on stable and nightly.\n\nI hit it myself; I'm playing with the SIMD work from @huonw's pull request, but I want to keep the crate working on stable. [I worked around it by using a conditional `include!(...)`](https://github.com/cesarb/blake2-rfc/commit/4dbacf33dd365ffc6a7e6b8b448adc6afc80fd39).\n",
