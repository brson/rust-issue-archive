    "body": "This is more-or-less working as intended, although there are further changes coming to trait types. Previously, traits as types were _implicitly_ boxed, but not written with `@`. The new, mostly unimplemented design, is that you can only cast between pointer types, so `@table as @Map`, `~table as ~Map`, `&table as &Map`.\n\nThe current functionality is still very limited, and not often used.\n",
