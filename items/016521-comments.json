    "body": "This is definitely an area we want to explore. Just a couple of notes:\n- This work needs to start out of tree in a community crate. It'll likely be a while before we'd want to land it in libcollections\n- We don't have GC, true, but we do have refcounting, and laziness/memoization can be built in library code. For example, [Purely functional data structures](http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504) includes implementations in Standard ML, which has no built-in laziness or memoization (though it does have GC). We should be able to tackle the full range of persistent data structures.\n- I agree about abstracting over smart pointers. This is another thing that will be possible with HKT, which is one of the reasons that work on persistent data structures right now is just experimental.\n\nI'd love to see a repo started for collecting (no pun intended) some of these data structures!\n",
