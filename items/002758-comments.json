    "body": "It sounds as if you want those functions to be pure, not the expressions that compute the function values.  I have the same problem in something I'm writing: exposing access to a piece of unique data within a data structure via a callback, which has to be pure to be able to safely borrow the argument.  And the only way to create a value to inhabit a `pure fn` type is with a named `fn` statement, which doesn't close over its environment, which leaves me back in C-land passing around explicit environment structs (and not being able to use do-notation).  So that's kind of annoying.\n\nI tried modifying the parser to accept `pure fn` expressions, but that ran into the assert at [typeck/check.rs line 197](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/release-0.3/src/rustc/middle/typeck/check.rs#L197), and at this point I do not even pretend to understand what's going on here.\n",
