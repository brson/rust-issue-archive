  "body": "This is a follow-up to [RFC PR #173](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/173). I was told there that changes like this don't need to go through the RFC process, so I'm submitting this directly.\n\nThis PR introduces `ToSocketAddr` trait as defined in said RFC. This trait defines a conversion from different types like `&str`, `(&str, u16)` or even `SocketAddr` to `SocketAddr`. Then this trait is used in all constructor methods for `TcpStream`, `TcpListener` and `UdpSocket`.\n\nThis unifies these constructor methods - previously they were using different types of input parameters (TCP ones used `(&str, u16)` pair while UDP ones used `SocketAddr`), which is not consistent by itself and sometimes inconvenient - for example, when the address initially is available as `SocketAddr`, you still need to convert it to string to pass it to e.g. `TcpStream`. This is very prominently demonstrated by the unit tests for TCP functionality. This PR makes working with network objects much like with `Path`, which also uses similar trait to be able to be constructed from `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>` and other `Path`s.\n\nThis is a breaking change. If constant literals were used before, like this:\n\n``` rust\nTcpStream::connect(\"localhost\", 12345)\n```\n\nthen the nicest fix is to change it to this:\n\n``` rust\nTcpStream::connect(\"localhost:12345\")\n```\n\nIf variables were used before, like this:\n\n``` rust\nTcpStream::connect(some_address, some_port)\n```\n\nthen the arguments should be wrapped in another set of parentheses:\n\n``` rust\nTcpStream::connect((some_address, some_port))\n```\n\n`UdpSocket` usages won't break because its constructor method accepted `SocketAddr` which implements `ToSocketAddr`, so `bind()` calls:\n\n``` rust\nUdpSocket::bind(some_socket_addr)\n```\n\nwill continue working as before.\n\nI haven't changed `UdpStream` constructor because it is deprecated anyway.\n",
