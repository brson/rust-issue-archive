The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @brson (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I don't think so, because array syntax requires that each successive macro invocation insert a different integer literal.\n\nI have managed to shorten it by removing all the `::default()` calls. Now each macro invocation fits on one line, at least.\n\n_EDIT: well, maybe there's a way that's a bit more complicated than that, let me sketch it out and see._\n\n@marcusklaas the problem with creating array literals is that for each item in the array, the macro invocation needs a token to expand to (unless the array is restricted to `Copy` types). You can see in the commit that, for example, the 32-len array needs 32 `T`s, and the 31-len array needs 31 `T`s.\n\n---\n\nNot clear on the stability tagging scheme and if this impl needs to be tagged with something. `#[stable(since = \"1.4.0\")]`?\n",
