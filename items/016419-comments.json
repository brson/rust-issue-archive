    "body": "@huonw so while I regard this as a net-win (and thus I r-plused it), I idly wonder: What is more important for a person using this -- that the names correspond to the names that would be printed via things like `stringify!`, with the hygiene information only rendered in a comment?  Or would it be better if we tried to maintain an invariant that if the input code compiled successfully, then the output of pretty printing will _also_ compile successfully, which would imply that we should in fact render the hygiene information using a semantically-significant format, such as e.g. re-rendering your example\n\n``` rust\nfn bar_61_0 /* 61#0 */() { y /* 60#2 */ + x /* 58#3 */ }\n```\n\nas this instead:\n\n``` rust\n#![feature(non_ascii_idents)]\n\nfn bar\u028361\u02830() { y\u028360\u02832 + x\u028358\u02833 }\n```\n\n(where I have chosen to put a non-ascii character as the marker for where the meta-data starts to reduce the chance that it will end up actually colliding with an actual variable from the source text -- another, more robust option would be to dynamically choose between `_`, `__`, `___`, etc until we find one that will not yield collisions with the identifiers from the original text.)\n",
