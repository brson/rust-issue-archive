It's also full of hand-rolled assembly and years of optimization, so it would be quite hard to compete with it from a performance standpoint. I think it would be a better idea to compare against implementations that other languages use (Go, Haskell, Python, etc.) and work towards beating all of those :wink:.\n",

    "body": "I think using `~` is definitely the way to go, and I don't think it really implies more copies. It just requires the calling code to be a bit smarter in certain cases where unnecessary allocation can be avoided. There are idioms used by the APIs of C big integer libraries to do minimal copying, but it doesn't map well to operator overloading.\n\ngmp has function definitions like this:\n\n```\nmpz_neg(output, input)\nmpz_add(output, input1, input2)\n```\n\nThe output can be the same variable as one of the inputs, or a different one. It will (for some operations) reuse the memory allocated for the output variable, whether or not the operation is actually in-place.\n\nEquivalents in rust:\n\n```\n// gmp: mpz_add(x, y, z)\nx = y + z // to initialize x\nx.set_add(y, z) // to re-use memory allocated to x\n// gmpxx uses an operator= overload using template hackery to do this for simple cases\n```\n\nAn operation like `i.set_add(x * y, z)` still has an implicit temporary value from the multiplication, but in a loop you could store it in variable and use `.set_mul(x, y)` instead of reallocating each time.\n\n```\n// gmp: mpz_add(y, y, z)\ny.set_add(y, z)\ny += z // once rust can overload += separately\n```\n\nSo basically, you just need a mutable in-place API and then a `pure` API implemented with that (`set_neg` in addition to `neg`, etc.).\n",

The first test `fib(n)` displays the `n`th Fibonacci number. The second test `factorial(n)` displays the factorial of `n`. These tests measure the amount of time it takes to compute and display (converting to decimal).\nIn Haskell, because I don't know how to disable lazy evaluation, display time and computation time are not clearly separated. Since the test only works on python2, an error has occurred in the test of python in Arch Linux.\n\nMy first impression is my implementation is very slow.\nAddition time and multiplication time are not so bad (but still slow. I think this is not a problem of the algorithm, and it's only a matter of how to program.)\nDisplay time is terribly slow. I think this caused by the following two points.\n- Radix conversion is implemented by a simple division.\n- Slow implementation of the division.\n\nFor now, I try to implement the Karatsuba radix conversion.\n",
