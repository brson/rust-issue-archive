  "body": "This commit adds `env_insert` and `env_remove` methods to the `Command`\nbuilder, easing updates to the environment variables for the child\nprocess. The existing method, `env`, is still available for overriding\nthe entire environment in one shot (after which the `env_insert` and\n`env_remove` methods can be used to make further adjustments).\n\nTo support these new methods, the internal `env` representation for\n`Command` has been changed to an optional `HashMap` holding owned\n`CString`s (to support non-utf8 data). The `HashMap` is only\nmaterialized if the environment is updated. The implementation does not\ntry hard to avoid allocation, since the cost of launching a process will\ndwarf any allocation cost.\n\nThis patch also adds `PartialOrd`, `Eq`, and `Hash` implementations for\n`CString`.\n",
