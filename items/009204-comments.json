    "body": "@alexcrichton OK, I just updated the patch to yet another possibility: just have the test put `foo.c` (and `foo.o` as well) in the same directory it's running in (i.e., the build directory), which was what was already happening with `db.json`.  This solves the problem of having stray files left in one's working copy, and it's more consistent.  (It turns out the `foo.o` was there in my working copy before, too, but I didn't notice it because it was gitignored.)\n",
