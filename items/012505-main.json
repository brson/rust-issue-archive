  "body": "The printing of the error message on stack overflow had two sometimes false\nassumptions previously. The first is that a local task was always available (it\ncalled Local::take) and the second is that it used `println!` instead of\nmanually writing.\n\nThe first assumption isn't necessarily true because while stack overflow will\nlikely only be detected in situations that a local task is available, it's not\nguaranteed to always be in TLS. For example, during a `println!` call a task\nmay be blocking, causing it to be unavailable. By using Local::try_take(), we\ncan be resilient against these occurrences.\n\nThe second assumption could lead to odd behavior because the stdout logger can\nbe overwritten to run arbitrary code. Currently this should be possible, but the\nutility is much diminished because a stack overflow translates to an abort()\ninstead of a failure.\n",
