    "body": "So, just so its clear: the current semantics (and thus what we'd stick with with option 1) is that the last `use` takes precedence over the earlier ones.\n\nI agree with @huonw : the lint seems like the obvious choice here.  Who cares if we have to turn it off in libstd, which user code won't be mucking with anyway?  (I don't see this as a safety concern the same way that memory-management is; I expect in common cases for any bugs relating to this to be exposed with relative ease, _expecially_ since one already gets the unused variable warning.)\n\n(The fact that the unused variable warning is falling down on the glob should be filed as a separate bug; I'll do that now.)\n",

    "body": "I would consider #8869 as closing this because I'm also in favor of leaving the rules as is. Resolve is already really tricky and having fewer rules is always a good thing. If we had extra rules about globs specifically and whether they could shadow or not, I think that'd complicate things further. I feel that with the lint actually being correct it would actually help things be clearer.\n\nThat being said, perhaps some of these other rules could help simplify things in the long run :).\n",
