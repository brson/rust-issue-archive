    "body": "One possible way to retain the `&[T] == Vec<T>` is to add this impl to libcore (untested):\n\n``` rust\nimpl<T, U> PartialEq<T, U> for &[T] where U: RhsSlice { .. }\n```\n\nAnd then `impl RhsSlice for Vec/Cow/etc`. IIRC, I submitted something similar (perhaps with Deref<[T]>?) when I was working in the first PR for overloaded equality -- at that time it was not accepted because it could let to downstream implementations that would break \"symmetry\" (a.k.a. if A == B works, then B == A should also work). It may be worth reconsidering since this PR would break symmetry anyway.\n",

    "body": "Another idea (cc @nikomatsakis): change the `a == b`/`a != b` type check code to:\n- If `A: PartialEq<B>` use `a.eq(&b)`\n- else if `B: PartialEq<A>` use `b.eq(&a)`\n- else raise \"doesn't implement PartialEq\" error\n\nAdvantages\n- As soon you `impl PartialEq<Foo> for Bar`, you get a \"symmetric\" operator, i.e. both `foo == bar` and `bar == foo` work.\n- Sidesteps the orphan_check problem, because e.g. you don't need `impl PartialEq<Vec<A>> for &[B]` (issue: `&[B]` is not local/covered) you can `impl PartialEq<&[B]> for Vec<A>` instead.\n- Needs only half of the implementations (halves the metadata bloat)\n- Can be extended to `PartialOrd`, e.g. use `a.lt(&b)` or `b.gt(&a)`\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Generic code/direct method calls remain asymmetric, i.e. given `fn my_eq<A: PartialEq<B>>(&A, &B)` then `my_eq(foo, bar)` works but `my_eq(bar, foo)` doesn't. This only applies if one implements a single direction, implementing both directions is still possible with this proposal (minus orphan_check restrictions).\n- Evaluation order may be the reverse of what you wrote. (possible footgun? do/should people rely on the evaluation order of the LHS/RHS?)\n- Compiler magic.\n\n~~I _think_ this \"magic\" can be removed in a backcompat fashion once we figure out how to encode symmetry in a blanket implementation (currently `impl<A, B> PartialEq<A> for B where A: PartialEq<B> { .. }` overlaps with every other implementation).~~ On a second thought, adding such blanket impl would probably be a backward incompatible change, so we may not add it post 1.0.\n",

    "body": "> I do think that evaluation order is fairly important to keep as left-to-right as possible personally. I don't think I make much code that relies on it, but it's bound to be quite a surprise for someone at some point!\n\nI though about this and I think is possible to maintain the evaluation order in the \"reverse\" case with the help of temporaries.\n\nUpdated algorithm:\n- If `A: PartialEq<B>` use `<a>.eq(&<b>)`\n- else if `B: PartialEq<A>` use `{ let rhs = <a>; let lhs = <b>; lhs.eq(&rhs) }`\n- else raise \"doesn't implement PartialEq\" error\n\n> I do like the symmetric guarantees that come out of this design, but the lack of symmetric in all locations is unfortunate.\n\nYes, it's unfortunate. I think the right way to ensure symmetry is to use the type system: (a) use a blanket implementation like I mentioned above (issue: overlapping impls), or (b) make the compiler automatically derive the reverse case even if it has to bypass the orphan_check (can this lead to a violation of coherence?).\n",

    "body": "So, the thing that makes me most uncomfortable here is the removal of two-sides checks on `assert_eq` with the assumption that people will reorder vec/slice comparisons. Seems pretty hacky.\n\nThat said, I don't think there's a strong reason for `assert_eq` to be two-sided, since it's not supposed to be testing the equality operator -- those should be in the unit tests for its own definition. That is, I don't _mind_ the change, but I'm a bit concerned about the arbitrary-seeming fallout here.\n\nAll that said... I'm not really sure what else to do. Once generic conversion traits land, we could perhaps use something like the `RhsSlice` trick but with `As<[T]>` instead.\n\nThoughts?\n",
