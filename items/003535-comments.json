    "body": "I did the patch to disable modes with unamed arguments. However, we have now a quite confusing error message:\n\n<pre><code>error: mismatched types: expected `fn&(&int)` but found `fn(&int)` (expected argument mode ++, but found &)</code></pre>\n\nSo I modify the argument dump to display:\n\n<pre><code>error: mismatched types: expected `fn&(&int)` but found `fn(&:int)` (expected argument mode ++, but found &)</code></pre>\n\nI wonder if this display could become a new syntax to specify modes for unamed arguments (that is adding a colon between mode and type).\nI you believe so, just tell me and I will add this syntax.\n",
