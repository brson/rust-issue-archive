  "body": "r? @brson This patch implements package IDs like\ngithub.com/catamorphism/test-pkg.\n\nTo support such package IDs, I changed the PkgId struct to contain\na LocalPath and a RemotePath field, where the RemotePath reflects\nthe actual URL and the LocalPath reflects the file name of the cached\ncopy. Right now, the only difference is that the local path doesn't\ncontain dashes, but this will change when we implement #6407.\n\nAlso, PkgIds now have a short_name field -- though the short name\ncan be derived from the LocalPath, I thought it was cleaner not to\ncall option::get() wantonly.\n",
