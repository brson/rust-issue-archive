    "body": "@ben0x539 \n\nMy initial thought is that maybe the pretty printer should be in charge of deciding for itself, based on the content of the string, what kind of string literal is best.\n\nE.g. if the author didn't \"need\" to use a raw string, then it seems to me like the pretty-printer could emit a normal string literal.  And likewise, if the author painfully put in a string with many escapes, the pretty-printer might scan it for any embedded doublequotes, and if so, then the longest occurrence of `\"##...` (which will hopefully be none at all), and use that to determine what kind of raw string to produce.\n\n(This would raise some policy questions like \"how many escapes is too many\" (as in, what is the threshold where I should switch to using a raw string).  Off the top of my head, I would say more than two escapes implies print raw-string.  Of course this would hopefully be easy to change after the fact.)\n\n---\n\nAlso, @kballard and @Kimundi will probably want to weigh in.  :) \n",

    "body": "addendum to my prior suggestion: My suggested policy was a bit naive; e.g. I am not sure I would want `\"\\n\\n\\n\"` or `\"\\t\\t\\t\"` to be pretty-printed as a raw-string.  And unicode escapes may also be exceptions of note (though I don't know if the pretty-printer actually prints those via escape sequences currently anyway).  So maybe it would be better to count up the number of escapes for things like `\\\\` and `\\\"`, and if _that_ is more than two, then use a raw-string.  Anyway, I trust you to work out these sorts of details.\n",

Inspecting spans would also fall short in the ast bits where there's no `lit_str`, just another kind of node with `str`s in it (though maybe they should be changed to carry a `lit_` around and only extract the string later on?)\n\nThere's so many ways to encode the same string, I'm not sure how far a heuristic would go towards finding the \"ideal\" string literal every time. :(\n",

Seems to work in expression context, `extern r\"Rust\"` ABI decls, `extern mod blah = r\"blah\"` position, with extra fields in a bunch of ast nodes storing an `enum StrStyle { CookedStr, RawStr(uint) }` that are mostly ignored or blindly reproduced outside of the pretty printer. I hope I didn't miss string literals impliclty carried in the ast elsewhere.\n\nThe `asm!()` syntax extension half-works; the pretty printer will reproduce the asm code as a raw string if it was given as such. I wasn't sure whether adding another `StrStyle` field for all the other positions for string literals in the `asm!()` parameters so I'm only allowing non-raw strings there for now. Tempted to suggest the syntax extension could parse things like `=r(0)` instead of `\"r\"(0)`. :}\n\nI apologize for holding up this feature for so long. This probably still isn't ready to merge, I don't feel very good about how the pretty-printing of raw string literals impacts the AST and its consumers and I'm still trying to think of a better way to handle it.\n",

Some examples for the behavior as of this push: http://ix.io/8nr becomes http://ix.io/8ns with `--pretty normal`. With `--pretty expanded`, we get http://ix.io/8nt.
