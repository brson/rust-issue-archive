    "body": "My impression has been that any GC that we would consider putting in would have to satisfy \"don't let a garbage collector pause a ~~thread~~ (Rust task) that doesn't use GC managed memory\", because each Rust task would be responsible for coordinating with its own instance of a GC coroutine for cleaning up its managed boxes.\n\nThen again, the above property alone would not actually satisfy a real-time programmer without some way to control the task scheduler to ensure that real-time operations do not get interrupted and miss their deadlines.  But I imagine that is an (implicit) requirement of this ticket, right?\n",
