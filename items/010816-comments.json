(OK, I'll admit the comment nesting I put in the Vim syntax yesterday is not perfect, but that's because of a slight parsing concept mismatch in Vim where it allows a contained region to open, interrupting a close match\u2014hence `/* */*` is highlighted as two levels deep rather than the `*` being out of the comment.)\n\n@cmr It can be approximated, but not done perfectly without a considerably more complex and computationally heavy (i.e. slow, which is probably not acceptable for a text editor) architecture. (Being pat rather than expr makes it a little bit less problematic, but doing it correctly still requires an absolute minimum of parsing all braces, brackets and parentheses in the syntax file.)\n\n@thestinger As a generalisation, syntax highlighters highlight all keywords; in `for $pat in $expr`, `in` is a keyword, so people will expect `in` to be highlighted.\n",
