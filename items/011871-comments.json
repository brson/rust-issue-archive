    "body": "In the past we have generally disagreed with the option of turning off stack safety prologues. In terms of user code, you have to explicitly opt-in to this by setting the stack bounds manually to (0, infinity). In terms of kernel code, you have to go through the difficulty of setting up segment selectors (at least on x86) which is a pain, sadly.\n\nI believe that the best solution to this problem is to find a solution to stack safety that requires no runtime at all. The guard page idea is essentially that, but we can't \"just use `chkstk`\" because it's not designed for unwinding. Any future solution we have to our stack-safety situation should be designed with unwinding in mind (on stack overflow).\n",

    "body": "I had never thought about using a custom pass of ours instead of modifying LLVM itself, I didn't even know it was capable of doing that!\n\nIf we could move all our morestack code to our own pass, then there should be nothing blocking us from using the system LLVM install (hurray!).\n\nMy current idea of the \"ideal future\" is one that doesn't involve the `chkstk` function. Rather, all functions will look like this:\n\n```\nfunction_foobar:\n    load $(-1 * page_size)(%rsp), %rax\n    load $(-2 * page_size)(%rsp), %rax\n    ...\n    load $(-stack_size)(%rsp), %rax\n    < rest of function >\n```\n\nThat way we have 0 runtime dependencies and you should trigger a fault when entering every function. Additionally `page_size` could actually be \"guard zone size\" which means we could emit some `load` instructions for larger stacks.\n\nThe benefit of this is that for small functions the overhead is still very small (just one load instruction), and for larger functions it doesn't matter too much anyway. I wanted to avoid needing a `chkstk` or related symbol.\n\nUnwinding-wise, the fault handler would detect a fault, detect it was in a guard zone, and then arrange the thread to execute at the the beginning of a piece of code that triggers unwinding. This is the part that's really hazy and I'm not quite sure that we can do just yet.\n",

Code is clearly ugly, but I just wanted to see if it worked. bharrisau/rust@c4b3c4f8d8cc7df927cacf3c8f12692a0996b23a\n\nBiggest issue is that you can only append a Pass on the PassManager. The pass dependencies aren't yet working exactly as I want them to so things aren't running in the right order.\n\nI'll keep trying.\n",
