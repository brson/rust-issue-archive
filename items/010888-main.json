  "body": "### Fix up float highlighting in Vim.\n\nThis fixes a regression introduced in #10793.\n\nHaving a colorscheme which highlights Float the same as Number (I\nbelieve most do), I hadn't noticed that having the special case of \"5.\"\nfloats (which was one of the added features in #10793) last made it take\nprecedence, and so it was left to @thestinger to notice it.\n\nThe regression meant that in `5.0`, the `5.` was a `rustFloat` (linked\nby default to `Float`) and the `0` was a `rustDecNumber` (linked by\ndefault to `Number`), and for `5.0f32` the `5.` was a `rustFloat` and\nthe `0f32` was a second `rustFloat` (and thus appeared correctly, though\nfor the wrong reason).\n### Vim keyword highlighting improvements.\n- Removed the `log` keyword;\n- Removed keyword duplicates;\n- Highlighted `const` as `Error` rather than `StorageClass`; and\n- Highlighted all the reserved keywords as `Error` rather than as\n  `Keyword`.\n\n(As usual, these highlightings can be overridden if desired.)\n",
