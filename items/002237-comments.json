    "body": "FWIW, I don't think it changes much for building on new architectures.  Most of the build is still building rustc itself.  To run our tests, we need to build the compiletest framework, which is in Rust.  So, essentially, when doing the 64-bit port at least, I spent 75% of the time just getting rustc to build.  it'll be the same on other architectures, I imagine.\n",
