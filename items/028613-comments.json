What you might rely on is knowing family of API is being called, but not exactly which function.\n\nFor example, for process spawning on linux knowing a function of `exec` family will be called might be useful, but it is not really good to tie the API strongly to one of `execl`, `execlp`, `execle`, `execv`, `execvp`, `execvpe` or even direct syscall implementation of `execve` or `execveat`.\n\nThere\u2019s a very good reason to do so. Eventually, in the future it might get discovered some `execzz` API is unsafe someway and a functionally equivalent, but safe alternative gets provided. Suddenly rust cannot move the implementation of process spawning to the newly-introduced (fictional) `execxxyy`, because it was specified that `execzz` is used.\n\nEDIT: perhaps a simpler example: For windows you might be interested that `DeleteFile` is called, but should not rely at all on some exact variant (`DeleteFileW` or `DeleteFileA`) of that function being used.\n\nNote, that I\u2019m aware we probably won\u2019t ever use the ANSI variants of functions on Windows, but what if windows suddenly goes utf-8 overnight and introduces `*UTF8` variants of all its functions?\n\nEDIT2: s/kind/family/\n",

What you might rely on is knowing kind of API is being called, but not exactly which function. \n\nYou mention spawning a process as an example, but that's not the kind of API I had in mind when I said \"map directly to system APIs\" -- quite the opposite, since in Rust spawning involves quite a bit of work and several syscalls. I'm referring to APIs that map _directly to a single (or in some cases two) system call_.\n\nSome examples that have come up where this kind of detail is important to know:\n- Sandboxing, where you have to whitelist underlying system APIs for use. @pcwalton's work on this front depended on knowing exactly what `std` was doing, and I'm sure he could elaborate on the need.\n- Precise flags. While `std` aims to be cross-platform, it's simply not possible to completely abstract away platform details. Knowing which system API is being used and with which flags is sometimes essential for understanding the exact behavior you can expect out of the call. Consider CLOEXEC (and whether it is set atomically) for example.\n- Error information. In some cases the precise error behavior varies by platform and it's important to know what to expect.\n\nNow, only the first use case truly demands knowing the _exact_ call being made. The other use cases could be addressed by giving platform-specific information at a somewhat higher level, which could make it more feasible to change what call we make over time.\n",

    "body": "> You mention spawning a process as an example, but that's not the kind of API I had in mind when I said \"map directly to system APIs\" -- quite the opposite, since in Rust spawning involves quite a bit of work and several syscalls. I'm referring to APIs that map directly to a single (or in some cases two) system call.\n\nMy example was intended to be fictional, of course, and generally applies to a wide set of scenarios involving APIs that map to syscalls more directly.

    "body": "@nagisa Sure, fair enough! I actually think it's great to be concrete here, but want to focus on realistic concrete cases if we can.\n\nI think fundamentally we want to try to get at **what aspects of a call into system APIs you care about**. For sandboxing, the identity of the API matters, and any change will break sandbox usages -- but you could perhaps argue that that's a niche case that should be calling `std::os::*` APIs directly, or something. For most other use cases, it might be possible to specify the behavior in a higher-level way (e.g. \"On Unix systems we always open in CLOEXEC and do so atomically whenever possible\" or some such). That's certainly a bigger effort to undertake, but it may be worthwhile.\n",

    "body": "I agree that we probably don't want to word this documentation in such a way that we're never able to modify the implementation in the future. These functions are likely to be relatively stable moving forward, but new things may pop up over time. For example `TcpListener::accept` currently only calls `accept` but we may want to perhaps probe for `accept4` on more recent Linux platforms.\n\nI definitely sympathize, however, that applications like gaol need syscall whitelists, but I think that the desire to have an ironclad guarantee about the syscalls being made are opposed to this desire to modify the standard library over time.\n\nPerhaps we could have a section of documentation (in `std::io`?) explaining the high-level philosophy including things like CLOEXEC as @BurntSushi mentioned as well as \"we try to map a function to a syscall where possible\". It could then also be explicitly documented that while relatively stable, the exact set of functions/syscalls made may change over time, but there is documentation indicating what's currently happening to help authors who want to explore the implementation.\n\nNow that being said, if you're looking to whitelist syscalls you're probably not that far off from just reading the source of the standard library, so the documentation-per-function may just be a nice-to-have.\n",

    "body": "Didn't mean to let fizzle, got busy with work and was hoping discussion would narrow down how pedantic these docs actually need to be by the time I got more free time. I'm still in for working on these, @alexcrichton! Next week, I'll be able to really spend some time on 'em :)  I'll add some more thoughts before it fizzles away for good...\n\nIMO, you either provide the underlying syscalls/Win32 calls in the platform notes, or nothing at all. The only real difference in behavior is directly due to what syscall call is made. The OS specific errors returned are also directly related to the underlying calls. I'd hope that knowing anything related to hardware in `std::io` is using the underlying OS's support, and would be common enough knowledge to avoid the _sometimes we use syscalls with some flags_ blanket note.\n\nI'd imagine the largest pool of users interested in this information would be in the security/sandboxing application space and anyone doing highly performant OS specific stuff. And as, @alexcrichton said, at this point you're digging into source. But also at this point, having the notes in the docs is a great deal more helpful than digging through a few layers of abstraction in source to find your end goal.\n\nNot sure I completely understand the stabilization issue enough? I'd assume semver and release notes/change logs would take care of those worries, unless I'm missing something? Changing the underlying syscalls used is not like changing the syntax of lifetimes. One causes separate compiler versions for the _ability_ to compile, while the other causes separate compiler versions for _behavioral compliance_. I'd also thing the users most affected by these types of changes would also be the same pool as above, and am assuming they would also be into reading those logs to see _exactly_ what changed in various functions to see if they need to adjust anything.\n",

    "body": "How about a section of the `std::io` docs talking about \"Platform behavior\" sections which explains that the current documentation is roughly what happens under the hood but it's not guaranteed to stay the same over time? This could also take care of the boilerplate like CLOEXEC and non-inheritable handles on Windows. Each section could then look something along the lines of:\n\n```\n/// # Platform behavior\n///\n/// This function currently corresponds to the `open` function \n/// on Unix and the `CreateFile` function on Windows. Note that,\n/// this may [change in the future][link-here], however.\n```\n",
