    "body": "I am worried about this error closing `/dev/urandom`. I think that it makes sense to not make this a fatal error (for now), since it's important that random number generation works, but I don't want to consider this problem fixed by ignoring it. If we close #3679 can we open another one to figure out why this call is failing, and add a FIXME to the code?\n",

    "body": "It's a weird one: close failing shouldn't affect the results that we got when reading which is all that we really care about. On the other hand close shouldn't be failing so there does some to be something going on that is ill understood and maybe it can affect seeding.\n\nGiven this I'm fine with leaving the issue open. Adding a FIXME recommending for checking for close errors again sounds fine too.\n",
