It handles arbitrary sizes and is more ergonomic. Deriving could be fixed either by using operators or by just modifying deriving to understand that (for things like Eq etc), if something is a fixed-length array, it ought to first convert to a slice. Hmm. As a bonus, I think it's not very hard to do.\n",
