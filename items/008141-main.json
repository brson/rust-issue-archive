  "body": "This is a preliminary implementation of `for ... in ... { ...}` using a transitionary keyword `foreach`. Codesize seems to be a little bit down (10% or less non-opt) and otherwise it seems quite trivial to rewrite lambda-based loops to use it. Once we've rewritten the codebase away from lambda-based `for` we can retarget that word at the same production, snapshot, rewrite the keywords in one go, and expire `foreach`.\n\nFeedback welcome. It's a desugaring-based approach which is arguably something we should have been doing for other constructs before. I apologize both for the laziness associated with doing it this way and with any sense that I'm bending rules I put in place previously concerning \"never doing desugarings\". I put the expansion in `expand.rs` and would be amenable to the argument that the code there needs better factoring / more helpers / to move to a submodule or helper function. It does seem to work at this point, though, and I gather we'd like to get the shift done relatively quickly.\n",
