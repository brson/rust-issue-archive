    "body": "Considering the hash change and duplicate-metadata-hash change, there's actually no simple way for us to dodge this experience in the 0.5 timeframe; and it'll realistically be possible in _all_ cases when someone fails to specify a particular version or tighter metadata match-set they're interested in. IOW the problem is more in the ubiquity of statements like `extern mod std;` with no further qualification, than in the ability to do side-by-side installation of multiple things named `std`.\n\nNot saying we should avoid trying to mitigate, just that I think as a \"bug\" it's neither fixable in this timeframe nor necessarily _ever_ fully fixable. It's an ambiguity that's forced on us by the loose coupling implied by underspecified linkage directives. We can only mitigate at most.\n",
