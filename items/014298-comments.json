    "body": "Sounds good; I'll submit an RFC.\n\n@brson: I agree that Rust macros have some rough edges, and I expect some early-adopter pain from using them so heavily in the HTML parser I'm writing.  That's basically in-scope for the Servo project.  Macros are feature-gated and it's fine if I have to rewrite them in the future, as long as I can still do basically the same things.\n\nIt seems that every large systems project contains some build-time code generators, scary C macros, and/or C++ metaprogramming weirdness.  When you have exacting requirements at runtime, it's extremely useful to do complicated things at compile time.  Or these projects just tolerate a lot of boilerplate.  Macros are the main reason my tokenizer is 900 lines instead of 6,000 like the others I've seen.  And the concise form is much closer to what's in the spec.  I need pattern macros to realize similar gains in the other major parser component (the tree builder).\n\nSorry about the mini-rant \u00ad\u2014 I know we all agree macros are useful. I just want to emphasize that powerful macros are an exciting and important feature for me, right up there with lifetime checking.\n",
