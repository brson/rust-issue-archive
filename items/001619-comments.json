    "body": "Yeah. We've been round and round on this many times. Definitely supporting TCP for `ret` adds the largest share of complexity to the call protocol, compiler, etc. I've said before that the fact that we have aliasing env capture makes me think the TCP-identical-`ret` is non-critical. I still feel that way. We can just ban it. It's not like `ret` mysteriously changes meaning. It doesn't work in a block. Period. Because it would break TCP and we want to avoid that. So you can write to an option in your environment, `break`, then check the flag and do an outer `ret` manually. It's probably faster to do that anyways than the inevitable boxing and switching it'd take to unwind through your iterators properly while passing a polymorphic return value back out.\n\nSo .. short story: I'm ok with just trying for `break` and `cont`. That's what scheme does anyways :)\n\nBut taking a lesson from scheme .. with what you're proposing here, it still feels a _bit_ overdone for the compiler to know about a core `loop_ctl` type, and to do the transformation when it's present. Considering that type is exactly 2-valued, might it also work to use `bool`, and transform `break` to `ret false` and `cont` to `ret true` when a block is `bool`-valued? I think you get the same effect, and nicer, the iterator can be written as `while blk(v[i]) { i += 1; }`\n",

    "body": "I guess it's a matter of taste. I always found the use of `bool` to mean keep-going to be kind of overloading.  In general I'm not a big fan of scalar types anyway, I guess, I prefer to use an enum or something to avoid mixing \"units\". \n\nBut there is one concrete issue with using bool: in that case, the compiler cannot help at all, which means that if we try to use loop_ctl ubiquitously, then every loop will look like:\n\n```\nvec::iter(v) {||\n  ...\n  cont;\n}\n```\n\nwhich doesn't really strike me as a good idea.  Of course you didn't want the compiler to help, which is fine too, but it strikes me that then we will always want to have two iteration primitives: one that always continues and one that may break.  We could make this less painful with traits, so that for a given type you need only define the breakable iterator and the \"always continue\" comes for free, but it still means two iteration methods:\n\n```\n  vec.iter {|| ...}\n```\n\nvs\n\n```\n  vec.iter_brk {||\n    ...\n    cont;\n  }\n```\n\n(Or we could re-use the `all` method, but I'd rather have `iter_brk`.  Re-using `all` always seems like a hack, and---besides---it returns a bool, so you would need an explicit semicolon afterwards since you don't actually want this boolean value.  But then it does tell you whether the loop exited via break or by falling off the end, which is useful.)\n\nWell, there are two or three possibilities.  I guess in the end I don't care that much.  Maybe I'll draw up them up in more detail with some examples and send out an mail to see what other people find most appealing, since this is ultimately an ergonomics issue more than anything.\n",
