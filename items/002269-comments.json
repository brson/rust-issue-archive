    "body": "It's important that we get functionality for this by either a keyword or a function in std or core. #553 _cannot_ solve this because `errno` cannot reliably be expected to exist as a global variable. The manpage states that it can be implemented as a macro, and that it is thread-local.\n\n```\nerrno  is  defined by the ISO C standard to be a modifiable lvalue of type int, and must not be explicitly declared; errno may be a macro.  errno is thread-local;\n```\n\nCurrently you can only use a getter-function defined in an external C library, but since most C-library wrapper crates will want to use this, it should be available in the default libraries. (I was told the cargo system doesn't handle additional C-library code, so providing such a wrapper with your crate is not a good solution. Even if cargo was to allow this, it's still an ugly one.)\n",
