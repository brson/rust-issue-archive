    "body": "@nikomatsakis \n\n> Have you encountered conditions where knowing the individual identity of the variables was important?\n\nI was mostly worried about conditions in which the same type variable would appear twice in a diagnostic, like in the example below:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<T>() -> T { unreachable!() }\npub struct X<T>(T);\npub struct Y<T>(T);\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = X(foo());\n    x = Y(x);\n}\n```\n\n```\n<anon>:7:9: 7:13 error: mismatched types: expected `X<<generic #2>>` but found `Y<X<<generic #2>>>` (expected struct X but found struct Y)\n<anon>:7     x = Y(x);\n```\n\nAnd I figured that therefore it _could_ be useful for the user to know that those types are indeed the same variable. Dropping the indices removes that information. I do share the skepticism, though, but would rather lean on the safe side here for now unless you really think we can always drop the IDs?\n",

The expected/found messages always result from type constraints not being satisfied and it is impossible for two type variables not to satisfy a constraint without at least one of them being partially constrained.\n",

    "body": "I think there was consensus that we should not differentiate integral/floating-point/other type variables in the output, as the distinction is not particularly meaningful (though I'd like to see a test where the failure to unify is due to one variable being integral and one being float, e.g.:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut x = 1;\nx = 2.0;\n```\n\nThere was some debate on IRC over `_` vs `?`. I favor `?` at this point, but it's a minor point. I'd like to see the distinction between `_#i` etc elided, though.\n",
