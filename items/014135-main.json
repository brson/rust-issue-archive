  "body": "This changes the previously naive string searching algorithm to a two-way search like glibc, which should be faster on average while still maintaining worst case linear time complexity. This fixes #14107. Note that I don't think this should be merged yet, as this is the only approach to speeding up search I've tried - it's worth considering options like Boyer-Moore or adding a bad character shift table to this. However, the benchmarks look quite good so far:\n\n```\ntest str::bench::bench_contains_bad_naive                   ... bench:       290 ns/iter (+/- 12)     from 1309 ns/iter (+/- 36)\ntest str::bench::bench_contains_equal                       ... bench:       479 ns/iter (+/- 10)     from  137 ns/iter (+/- 2)\ntest str::bench::bench_contains_short_long                  ... bench:      2844 ns/iter (+/- 105)    from 5473 ns/iter (+/- 14)\ntest str::bench::bench_contains_short_short                 ... bench:        55 ns/iter (+/- 4)      from   57 ns/iter (+/- 6)\n```\n\nExcept for the case specifically designed to be optimal for the naive case (`bench_contains_equal`), this gets as good or better performance as the previous code.\n",
