  "body": "Sigil highlighting isn't perfect (especially how it handles `&`) but\nafter having used it for a week I feel it to be considerably nicer than\nnothing. As usual, if you don't like it, you can turn it off easily by\noverriding the default highlighting.\n\nGenerics are not handled specially; this means that for something like\n`S<T>`, the `<` and `>` are highlighted as operators. For myself,\nI like this, and there is no way to make it properly context aware\nwithout expanding the syntax matching enormously.\n\nAlso, special characters are highlighted properly in strings/chars, e.g.\n`\"\\x00\"` or `'\\Ufedcba98'` appropriately.\n",
