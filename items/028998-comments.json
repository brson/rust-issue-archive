    "body": "Thanks for the report! I think things are basically working as intended here, however, as there's a number of pieces in the source that need to be touched up to get this to work:\n- In the C++ code the external declaration of `rust_function` needs to be tagged with `extern \"C\"` as well to ensure that name mangling doesn't happen (and the right ABI is used).\n- On the Rust side of things you'll need to tag the `rust_function` with `#[no_mangle]` to disable the compiler's name mangling.\n- On the Rust side of things you'll also need to mark the function as `pub` as it needs to be visible to C (e.g. crate public).\n\nOnce those are done it should work just fine!\n",
