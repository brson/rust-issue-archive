  "body": "After getting an ICE trying to use the `Repr` enum from middle::trans::adt (see issue #7527), I tried to implement the missing case for struct-like enum variants in `middle::ty::enum_variants()`. It seems to work now (and passes make check) but there are still some uncertainties that bother me:\n- I'm not sure I did everything, right. Especially getting the variant constructor function from the variant node id is just copied from the tuple-variant case. Someone with more experience in the code base should be able to see rather quickly whether this OK so.\n- It is kind of strange that I could not reproduce the ICE with a smaller test case. The unimplemented code path never seems to be hit in most cases, even when using the exact same `Repr` enum, just with `ty::t` replaced by an opaque pointer. Also, within the `adt` module, `Repr` and matching on it is used multiple times, again without running into problems. Can anyone explain why this is the case? That would be much appreciated. \n\nApart from that, I hope this PR is useful.\n",
