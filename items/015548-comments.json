    "body": "Any sort of debug-only `Show` impl means clients of your crate can't debug using your types. For example, clients of libsyntax won't be able to debug libsyntax-provided values if libsyntax adopted this sort of `DebugShow`.\n\nAny sort of compile-time solution to this problem is very problematic. It involves allowing each client crate to re-derive its own `Show` instance and I can't see that working well.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to expand `TyDesc` to also provide info about specially-marked traits (which in this case would just be `Show`). If the `debug` reflection can construct a `&Show` at runtime for a type that implements it, then it could use this to print a derived-`Show`-like representation of a type at runtime without having to derive it at compile-time. A big advantage of this approach is it should work for any type without having to modify the type definition, which is a big help when debugging values from other crates (e.g. clients of libsyntax printing AST values).\n\nWe could also add a `DebugShow` trait that would be used instead of `Show` if implemented, thus allowing types to provide more information about themselves for debugging purposes.\n",
