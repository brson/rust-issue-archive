    "body": "This clearly needs discussion at the meeting (which is delayed until the new year because of holidays) but I am tentatively in favor because of custom allocators. However, we need to decide how this contrasts with:\n\n```\npub struct AHashMap<K,V,A> {\n    allocator: A,\n    ...\n}\n\npub type HashMap<K,V,A> = AHashMap<K,V,Heap>;\n```\n\nRight now this won't work because you won't be able to write `HashMap::new()`, but I wonder if we aren't better off fixing _that_ problem, because the inability to call methods through typedefs is a major annoyance for other reasons and it might just end up allowing us to get sugary support for custom allocators.\n",

(This is possibly/probably good to change, but not directly relevant for this bug.)\n\n> I note that, using the scheme from your comment, if you want to be able to manually specify only the allocator, even with default type arguments you'll need a type HashMapAlloc<K, V, Alloc> = HashMap<K, V, SipHash, Alloc> typedef, because only arguments at the end are defaulted. \n\n(Just to be clear, I left that one out because, on first thought, it seemed like it would be the rarest; this may or may not be true. I wasn't omitting it to attempt to paper over a deficiency.)\n\n> they appear to want type parameters to be in the opposite order\n\nDoes HKT _require_ partial application only at the end of a type? This seems rather unlikely to me. Certainly writing `impl<K> Functor for HashMap<K>` (for the current scheme of `struct HashMap<K,V> { ... }`) and having the `V` parameter implicit seems rather peculiar since our \"function applications\" at the type level are delimited by `< ... >` rather than just whitespace ala Haskell.\n\nThat said, the best other scheme I can think of right now is something like `impl<K> Functor for HashMap<K, _>`, which probably has other deficiencies.\n",

    "body": "> There is a negative interaction with Higher-Kinded Types: if effectively requires us to make partially applied types explicitly indicated (e.g., `HashMap<K, ..>`); also, there will be no hiding these extra type parameters from the kind, so `HashMap` would still be `* -> * -> *` (Key, Value, Allocator)\n\nRequiring partial application to be explicit might be alright. But this is ignoring the subtler issue: if you want to be able to write a `Functor` instance for `HashMap`, then `Value` has to be at the end. If you want to have a default type argument for `Alloc`, then `Alloc` has to be at the end. I don't see a way around this conflict.\n",
