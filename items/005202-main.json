  "body": "As per https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-wanted-libraries.\n\nIterates over lines in a series of files, e.g. a basic `cat`\n\n``` rust\nuse std::fileinput;\nfn main() {\n    for fileinput::input |line| {\n        io::println(line);\n    }   \n}\n```\n\nThe API is essentially a subset of [Python's fileinput module](http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/fileinput.html), although the lack of default arguments and global mutable state means that there are extra functions to handle a few different cases (files from command line arguments, files from a vector, accessing current filename/line number).\n\nA few points that possibly require adjustment:\n- Most functions take vectors of `Path` (well, `Option<Path>`) rather than just `~str`, since this seems safer, and allows finer control without the number of different functions/methods increasing exponentially.\n- `pathify` has a stupid name.\n- I'm not quite sure how to mock tests that require external files: the tests in `libcore/io.rs` seem to indicate using a `tmp` subdirectory, so that's what I did, but I can't reliably build rust on this computer to test (sorry! although I have run the tests in just `fileinput.rs`  after creating `./tmp/` manually).\n- The documentation I've written seems pretty crappy and not particularly clear.\n- Only UTF8 files are supported.\n",
