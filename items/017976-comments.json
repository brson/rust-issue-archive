    "body": "I can only reproduce this by explicitly giving `-C target-feature=-sse` (or `-sse2`, which allows SSE instructions for `f32`) to rustc. It seems that at point between October 2014 and now, something has changed to assume SSE2 by default on x86, but one can explicitly disable it. I don't know if this was intentional but apparently it didn't cause enough problems for anyone to investigate and revert it.\n\n`rustc -vV`:\n\n```\nrustc 1.3.0-dev (2f0140611 2015-07-05)\nbinary: rustc\ncommit-hash: 2f0140611c9b47117a85753ecffe1acfa59a5cbe\ncommit-date: 2015-07-05\nhost: i686-unknown-linux-gnu\nrelease: 1.3.0-dev\n```\n",

    "body": "The story for using SIMD instructions is going through churn, but this is about what CPU features rustc assumes, and consequently which instructions LLVM will emit for perfectly ordinary, scalar calculations (just `f32`/`f64`, no vectors or even intrinsics).\r\n\r\nThe story here is unchanged since my last comment (rustc assumes SSE2 on the usual 32 bit x86 targets), with the caveat that there are extra targets (`i386-...`) for people who need to run on pre-SSE2 hardware. And by now this is not a temporary accident, but a long-standing policy.\r\n\r\nI do agree with closing the issue, it's unlikely many people will ever encounter the joys of the x87 FPU, since rustc defaults to SSE2.",
