    "body": "also, it might be nice if the benchmark output right-aligned the decimal points in the numbers, for ease of quick comparison by eye.\n\nDoing the above in full generality is probably not worthwhile, since it requires knowing how many digits the maximal output has before you present any results.  (It also requires knowing the longest test name, but that is easier to predict accurately. ;)\n\nBut even just guessing a reasonable value for the max number of digits for `ns/iter`, e.g. 9 or 10, and then using that for format width padding, would be step forward.\n",
