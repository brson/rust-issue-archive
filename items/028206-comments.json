Requiring a stage2 compiletest requires compiling the entire stage1 compiler before `check-stage1-rpass` can be run which is pretty unfortunate.  This PR also uses features like `#[thread_local]` (not portable) and `rt::unwind::register` (super unstable) which I would prefer to avoid.\n",

    "body": "separate code paths? what are you talking about? I have 1 code-path. It would be better to have a sane panic-control API rather than the crazy interdiction thing I am doing, but the current implementation is also rather ugly.\n\nstage2 compiletest only depends on stage2 `libstd` etc. (aka `make check-stage1`), and you need stage2 `libstd` anyway for doing anything. It does not depend on a stage2 compiler (`libsyntax`, `librustc`, etc.) - that's the expensive part.\n\nThe moment we get a better panic-control API I will switch to it. Maybe even remove the thread-local - it is not strictly needed.\n\nIt is very important to be able to react sanely to panics. Printing an ugly error to stderr and unwinding is not necessarily a sane reaction. Rust will be pretty much unusable if there is no such way.\n",
