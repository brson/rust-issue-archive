The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "You are right. `Vec::with_capacity()` does not mention in the docs that the implementation might choose to over-allocate. However `shrink_to_fit()` does mention that in the docs explicitly, even though its not used by the current code: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.shrink_to_fit\nThat\u2019s what #29847 is all about.\n\nThe other possibility is to make sure that `with_capacity()` and `shrink_to_fit()` really use exact capacity (removing the note from the docs) and just make the implicit growth and `reserve()` code use alloc_size. `reserve_exact()` docs also say that the allocator might reserve more than requested.\n\nDepending on your usage pattern, this might actually be a win.\nLike if you reserve space for 1025 u32 values, the allocator actually gives you enough memory for 2048 u32 values. But yes, that is a very contrived example.\n",

The exact sizes depend on the jemalloc configuration, but this kind of steadily increasing spaces between size classes will always be present with jemalloc.\n\nFWIW, we have found it worthwhile to modify multiple vector-like classes in Firefox to maximize capacity in the way suggested by this PR. \n",
