  "body": "dropck: must assume `Box<Trait + 'a>` has a destructor of interest.\n\nFix #25199.\n\nThis detail was documented in [RFC 769](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0769-sound-generic-drop.md#the-drop-check-rule); the implementation was just missing.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nThe breakage here falls into both obvious and non-obvious cases.\n\nThe obvious case: if you were relying on the unsoundness this exposes (namely being able to reference dead storage from a destructor, by doing it via a boxed trait object bounded by the lifetime of the dead storage), then this change disallows that.\n\nThe non-obvious cases: The way dropck works, it causes lifetimes to be extended to longer extents than they covered before. I.e.  lifetimes that are attached as trait-bounds may become longer than they were previously.\n- This includes lifetimes that are only _implicitly_ attached as trait-bounds (due to [RFC 599](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0599-default-object-bound.md)). So you may have code that was e.g. taking a parameter of type `&'a Box<Trait>` (which expands to `&'a Box<Trait+'a>`), that now may need to be assigned type `&'a Box<Trait+'static>` to ensure that `'a` is not inadvertantly inferred to a region that is actually too long.  (See commit ee06263 for an example of this.)\n",
