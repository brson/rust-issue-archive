    "body": "Hm, it took me a second to think about this. \n\nIf you remove `Send + Sync` from all bounds, then it's safe to create `Arc<Cell<int>>` and share it among threads. Each instance of `Arc<T>` will be `Send` so long as `T` is `Send` (which `Cell<int>` is), but being this means that `T` needs to adhere to `Sync` if `T` is `Send`.\n\nI think that we may be able to remove the `Send` bounds, but we may not be able to remove the `Sync` bounds.\n\nI do agree, however, that the documentation of `Arc` could use some improvement!\n",
