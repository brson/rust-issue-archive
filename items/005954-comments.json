    "body": "I don't think it comes up often, but poking a hole through the API seems like a valid use case for `unsafe` functions. For example an object might use a raw pointer internally assumed to be valid and allow setting the field to another value through an `unsafe` function. Obtaining a raw pointer and assigning it to a field is considered totally safe.\n",
