    "body": "There are a two questions I can think of that the unwinding code needs to have answers to:\n- Am I currently unwinding? -- abort on double failure\n- Am I currently in a try/catch block? -- abort on try/catch patterns\n\nPerhaps these can be solved with thread-local globals? Right now we only have to worry about _one_ thread local global which is quite convenient.\n\nAdditionally, exposing a safe interface around this is going to be tough. I think that we can get by with:\n\n```\nfn try(f: ||) -> bool;\n```\n\nI remember there being issues around stack closures leaving captured things in an unusual state, but this doesn't seem much different to me than normal failure, so I may be forgetting why stack closures on try boundaries is a bad idea.\n",
