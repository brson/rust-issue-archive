    "body": "@hatahet Do you mean making it a built-in _keyword_ with syntax of its own? As it stands, it is in the prelude which means it's a built-in function. When `do` is removed (which I'm working on), it will just operate as\n\n``` rust\nspawn(proc() {\n    ...\n})\n```\n\nThat is not a horribly ugly monstrosity. Sure, it's not quite as nice-looking as `do spawn { ... }`, but it's not bad and is clear. I believe there will be general agreement in the core team that `spawn` should not be made a separate keyword (`spawn { ... }`); there are other ways of spawning a task (e.g. if you manually construct a task object you have `task.spawn(proc() { ... })`. And any syntax which could cope with all the cases would be exactly what we're looking at removing now.\n",
