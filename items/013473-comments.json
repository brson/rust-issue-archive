(The `(a = b) == ...` could theoretically work, since it could be like writing `*({ a = b; &a }) == ...` which will work fine.)\n",

    "body": "I like the current status quo, as it prevents bugs like:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut a = false;\nif a = foo() { }\n```\n\nAnd stuff like [this](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/). While the scope of this bug is reduced because Rust doesn't accept anything but `bool` in conditionals, I still feel like its nice to completely wipe this bug out.\n\nThe motivating line reading example can be re-written (as per huonw's pattern) to look like this:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut reader = stdin();\nlet mut line = ~\"\";\nwhile { line = reader.read_line().unwrap(); line.as_slice() } != \"something\"\n{\n    println!(\"{}\", line);\n}\n```\n\nwhich I find inoffensive (only problem is that `line` doesn't auto-slice).\n\nI don't know if point about bug prevention is in fact an intentional design decision, and if so, perhaps a good candidate for the design FAQ (#4047) ?\n",
