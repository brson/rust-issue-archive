So I don't think the semi-colon accomplishes much.\n\nThis is doubly confusing because we also have move-mode and copy-mode parameters. What's the difference between `fn&(-c)` and `fn&(move c)`. It's not obvious.\n",

I thought about removing the semi-colons so that there are no \"sections\" in the parameter list.  the main downside is the need to repeat the `move` keyword a lot.  It seems like it might be common to want to copy and move a number of variables, in which case I think:\n\n```\nfn@(a: int, b: int;\n    move x, y;\n    copy w, z)\n```\n\nseems nicer than `fn@(a: int, b: int, move x, move y, copy w, copy z)`.\n\nBut I don't feel too strongly about this.\n",
