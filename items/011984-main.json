  "body": "- `extra::json` didn't make the cut, because of `extra::json`'s required\n  dep on `extra::TreeMap`. If/when `extra::TreeMap` moves out of `extra`,\n  then `extra::json` could move into `libserialize`\n- `libextra`, `libsyntax` and `librustc` depend on the newly created\n  `libserialize`\n- The extensions to various `extra` types like `DList`, `RingBuf`, `TreeMap`\n  and `TreeSet` for `Encodable`/`Decodable` were moved into the respective\n  modules in `extra`\n- There is some trickery, evident in `src/libextra/lib.rs` where a stub\n  of `extra::serialize` is set up (in `src/libextra/serialize.rs`) for\n  use in the stage0 build, where the snapshot rustc is still making\n  deriving for `Encodable` and `Decodable` point at extra. Big props to\n  @huonw for help working out the re-export solution for this\n- @pcwalton's change in 449a7a8 didn't sneak back in\n",
