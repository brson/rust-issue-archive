The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

The tests we add are typically compiletests - these are `.rs` files which are compiled and the compilation result is checked. Because #28172 is erroneous code, your test will check that it is rejected with a correct error message - this is called a compile-fail test. All files in `src/test/compile-fail` are compile-fail tests.\n\n``` Rust\n// Copyright 2015 The Rust Project Developers.

Most of the history doesn't seem so relevant anymore.\n\n> BTW, is there any way I can familiarize myself more with the Rust codebase? This is one of my first pull requests to Rust, so I don't have much domain-specific knowledge.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure of any great resource. I guess it's our job to let you know about these things :)\n",
