    "body": "I've been looking at this one as I originally discovered it. I've been looking in the wrong place though... it is not just sum-types, but any cast of a unique struct to a unique trait. This also segfaults:\n\n```\npub trait Foo {}\n\npub struct Struct;\n\nimpl Foo for Struct {}\n\nfn func(thing: ~Foo) {}\n\nfn main() {\n  let a = ~Struct as ~Foo;\n  let b = func(a);\n}\n```\n\nIt segfaults on a glue_drop function in both examples. I'm not too certain about the invariants of the takes and drops. I'm assuming they are done in mirror. Is it dropping something twice by mistake?\n",
