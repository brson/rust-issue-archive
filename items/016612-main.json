  "body": "There is a check in TwoWaySearcher::new to determine whether the needle is periodic. This is needed because during searching when a match fails, we cannot advance the position by the entire length of the needle when it is periodic, but can only advance by the length of the period.\n\nThe reason \"bananas\".contains(\"nana\") (and similar searches) were returning false was because the periodicity check was wrong.\n\nCloses #16589\n\nAlso, thanks to @Gankro, who came up with many buggy examples.\n",
