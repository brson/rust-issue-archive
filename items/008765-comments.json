    "body": "The naming conventions of `TypeName`, `function_or_variable_name` and `CONSTANT_NAME` are very well established and unlikely to change at this point. I don't think `Foo_bar_baz` is a sane naming convention so it would mean changing the name of every single function we define to `FooBarBaz` or `fooBarBaz`.\n\nIt's possible that the `priv` keyword would be removed because it's almost always the default, but I definitely don't see Rust enforcing a naming convention like this.\n",
