  "body": "methods on slice types. However, the relevant traits were not included\nin the prelude, meaning that you would have to manually import\n`std::ops::Slice` to get these operations -- an unintended regression.\n\nThis commit adds the traits to the prelude, as is done with most other\noperator traits.\n\nUnfortunately, the trait `std::slice::Slice` (which defines an\n`as_slice` method) was already included in the prelude. This trait is\nrenamed to `AsSlice`, which is a better name in any case.\n\nIn addition, because of both `AsSlice` and `Str` traits being included\nin the prelude, both of which define `as_slice`, and both of which are\nused for generic programming, this commit renames `ops::Slice::as_slice`\nto `ops::Slice::as_slice_`. This is a stopgap solution; we'll need to\nfigure out a long-term story here later on.\n\nCloses rust-lang#17710\n\nDue to the renamings, this is a:\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
