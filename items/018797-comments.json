I find the error in that previous issue still happens as of right now with a complete up-to-date install of Rust via rustup.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I see the following error when trying to compile a basic Rust program on Windows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncollect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it's clear that the Rust toolchain is using an existing mingw32 setup, not it's bundled one. I'm using the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu (default)\r\nrustc 1.57.0 (f1edd0429 2021-11-29)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did try adding the the following to the PATH:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.rust\\toolchains\\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\\lib\\rustlib\\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\\bin\\gcc-ld\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added that _before_ the part of the PATH that had a link to the `bin` directory of the mingw setup. The only way I found this could work was to entirely remove the reference to mingw path from the setup entirely. And when I did that, I didn't even need the above path to the toolchains in place.\r\n\r\nSo is that the solution that was decided upon?",
