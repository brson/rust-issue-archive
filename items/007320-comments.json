    "body": "Sully's error is legit, in the sense that the type system is operating as expected. The type `Self` may contain borrowed pointers, and the type `@Foo` is short for `@Foo:'static`, which says that the value does NOT contain borrowed pointers. The correct way to implement the example (which I think does not work yet) would be:\n\n```\ntrait Foo : 'static { ... }\n```\n\nwhich would say that the trait `Foo` cannot be implemented except by types that do not contain borrowed pointers.\n\nIf we added the rule that `@` boxes cannot contain managed pointers, as we have discussed, it is plausible that we could then extend the type system to know that `Self` has the bound `'static` in an `@self` method (or any method that contains an `@Self` parameter). I described such a scheme [in this blog post](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/06/reducing-dst-annotation/) about the `Sized` kind.\n",
