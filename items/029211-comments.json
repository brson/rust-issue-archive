    "body": "I think though that in this case it's \"correct\", right? `AtomicPtr` has interior mutability so if you have `AtomicPtr<Foo<'static>>` but were able to put a `Foo<'a>` inside it, that would be bad I think? With `Box`, `Arc`, `Rc`, and `&` there's no interior mutability which is why I think it's ok to not be invariant.\n\nI could just be saying words here!\n",
