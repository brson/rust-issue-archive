    "body": "> Nothing in the types prevents this, so it's possible for a conflict to arise though - there's nothing that prevents your library **or any code that uses your library** from doing this:\r\n\r\nWell, there's conflicting implementation detection, isn't there?\r\nWhy should we prevent a library from building if it only MIGHT cause conflicting implementations?\r\nShouldn't we rather prevent the code that uses the library in ways that DO cause conflicting implementations from compiling?\r\nIn most cases, code that would cause conflicts is usually also the code that may have done questionable choices, or even choices that we as library developers would like to forbid, but since negative reasoning is forbidden in Rust, we can't.\r\n\r\nFor example, a `Point` is neither a `Circle` nor a `Square`: it is shapeless (if I asked you to \"expand\" a point, where \"expand\" is an additive operation that retains shape but increases some parameter of the shape by a finite value, you would need to cast the `Point` into a shape before expanding that shape (and the casting shape will, disregarding special cases such as square-matrix displays being the context of the point, be a `Circle`)), so if you need to model a `Point` as both, you may need to review why such use-cases happen, and maybe use std::convert to allow `Point`s to become 0-radius `Circle`s or 0-length `Square`s and back?\r\n\r\nThe example taken in this issue (which has had many like it appear) really shows (in my opinion) why Rust should switch from preventing POTENTIAL conflicts to preventing ACTUAL conflicts. Why should POTENTIAL conflicts prevent useful things from being done? Sure, warnings would be nice, but errors? \r\n\r\nIn general, I am against that \"Additions should never be breaking\" idea, yes it's not the most intuitive thing to debug that your program doesn't build with new stuff that's only been additive, but the error messages are helpful enough that it's easy to understand where and why a conflict occurs, whereas thinking your whole architecture around potential conflicts is really hard and limiting (at least, until we get proper specialization).",
