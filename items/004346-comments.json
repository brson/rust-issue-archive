    "body": "Thanks!\n\nThere are some notes on how to operate the test suite here: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-testsuite\n\nI'd suggest that this needs at least one test for 'mut' in normal function arguments, another in closure arguments, and the corresponding negative (compile-fail) tests that non-mutable arguments can't be mutated.\n\nThe pretty printer should be fairly straightforward, just find the code that prints function arguments and add `mut` if necessary.\n",
