    "body": "Something similar is likely to be useful for moves to `rt::io` in many cases, and certainly in moving `extra::json` as discussed in #8679.  I believe there are no plans for directly recreating the character and string i/o methods that are currently in `std::io`, but if this method or a similar one exists it would be possible to update code using `with_str_writer` by simply adding string-to-byte conversions.\n",
