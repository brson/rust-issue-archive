    "body": "OK, I've figured out what is going on. The problem is that the matcher is too strict when deciding what patterns are included in some condition. Essentially the problem is that it decides that the condition that are relevant are \"length > 1\" and \"length > 0\" and decides that [2, .. _] is the only pattern that matches \"length > 1\", which is obviously bogus. Fixing this seems a bit tricky, since we need to be able to properly expand out the patterns while still properly handling bindings.\n\nNote that this seems like a degenerate case, since the last pattern could just be replaced with a _, but there are more complicated and interesting things where this happens too.\n",
