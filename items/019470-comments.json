    "body": "I thought this through. I am mildly uncomfortable with @arielb1's proposed rules in that I do not expect the ordering of type parameters to be significant (which is not to say that those rules would not solve the problem). @aturon and I worked through some examples and we felt like these rules captured our intution reasonably well:\n\n```\nLocal(Trait<T2...Tn> for T1) =\n    Trait is local || (\n       exists i. Local(Ti) &&\n       forall i. Ti is not a type parameter\n    )\nLocal(Type<T1...Tn>) =\n    Type is local || (\n       exists i. Local(Ti) &&\n       forall i. Ti is not a type parameter\n    )\n```\n\nThis can be summarized as \"type parameters can only appear as parameters of a local type/trait\". This seems to cover the various cases I can think of. I have not tried to prove it sound but I believe it is. Of course I thought that before. :) Once I've had some more coffee, I might take a crack at that, seems like it should be a simple inductive exercise.\n",

    "body": "The repository now contains an encoding of the rules that I think more accurately captures what I was going for, and has the side benefit of being (afaik) sound. An impl of some trait `Trait` for some type `Type` (multidispatch can be considered as a tuple) is legal if:\n- `Trait` is defined in the current crate OR (`Type` _is local_ AND `Type` _is covered_)\n\nA type `Type` _is local_ if:\n- It contains at least one nominal type defined in the current crate\n\nA type `Type` _is covered_ if:\n- All type parameters appear underneath a local type constructor\n\nIf you find that textual definition confusing, see [the code](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/orphan/blob/d8312e436453c72028f4f9faf048723d6db93b55/src/lib.rs#L39-L84).\n\nIn any case, I think this is a subset of @arielb1's definition (as expected). The reason is that @arielb1's requirement was that, when iterating `Trait<Self,T1,...Tn>` in pre-order, a local type always appeared before any type-parameter. In these rules, the type parameter must appear _underneath_ a local type, so by definition it appears after the local type in pre-order.\n\n@arielb1 let me know what you think!\n",

I am coming to the idea that this is the only way to preserve the expressiveness we want.\n\nNote in particular that if we permit \n\n```\nCrate 1: impl<T> Iterator<T> for Foo<T>\nCrate 2: impl<A,B> Iterator<Bar<A>> for B\n```\n\nthen there is a potential coherence conflict for `Iterator<Bar<Foo<T>> for Foo<T>`.\n\nHowever, it may be that we can avoid ordering dependency by permitting \"uncovered\" type parameters as long as they are covered _somewhere_. I have to try and prove this.\n",

    "body": "So @aturon and I had a long conversation about this and we've decided that @arielb1's original ordering-based solution is probably the best we are going to do. It is somewhat unfortunate, but there are critical patterns that are just not supported by the coverage-based rules. We tried to find a way to combine the two rules, but the most important pattern seems inherently unsupportable:\n\n```\nimpl<T> BorrowFrom<Rc<T>> for T\n```\n\nAs long as you permit something like:\n\n```\nimpl<T> BorrowFrom<T> for LocalType\n```\n\nthen there will be an inherent conflict. Luckily we are planning to change `BorrowFrom` to `Borrow`, so maybe this just becomes a thing -- you must order your type parameters well.\n\nSimilar problems arise with binops, but there the problems run deeper:\n\n```\nimpl<E,T:Iterator<Item=E>> Add<T> for MyVec<E>\n```\n\nThis pattern is ok, but changing the order of the add operands is not. However, that seems to just be...what it is. And what's more, if we DID permit both orders, there's an obvious conflict between any two vector implementations that want to be addable to all iterators. So forcing an ordering makes those semantics clear.\n\nPerhaps we'll find a way to improve this rule in the future; it should be backwards compatible to accept more impls.\n\nSorry @arielb1 for taking so long to come around!\n",

It does cause failures on some test cases that the other check accepted, such as:\n- `impl Remote<BigInt> for int`\n- `impl Remote<BigInt> for Vec<int>`\n\nBoth of these are interesting patterns, but otoh they can't be scaled up to blanket impls over all `T:ToInt` or anything like that.\n\nThe advantage of the simpler check is primarily that it's easier to explain. It also doesn't commit us to the full ordering rules just yet, in case we come up with something better (though I'm not so worried about that).

    "body": "Ah, I was wrong, there one additional failure that I didn't notice before using the more restrictive rules, and it's a semi-interesting one:\n- `impl<'a, T> FromIterator<T> for Cow<'a, Vec<T>, [T]>`\n\nHere the type parameter `T` appears uncovered, even though it also appears covered.\n\nThis gives me an idea for an alternative rule. One could imagine:\n1. The self type must reach something local\n2. All type parameters in the self type must be covered by a local type in the self type\n\nThis allows type parameters to appear in arbitrary other places. I believe this is sound, though, or at least as sound as the original typing rule -- it's basically the covering rule applied only to the self type. \n\nOne reason this rule is interesting is that it does permit for truly order-independent traits, though they must be implemented using tuples in the self type. (Rather like my original max-min proposal for multidispatch.) Not saying we will use this pattern, but it leaves the door open.\n\nI implemented this rule too. It builds all stdlibs as well.\n",

    "body": "@nikomatsakis and I talked about this last proposal:\n\n> 1. The self type must reach something local\n> 2. All type parameters in the self type must be covered by a local type in the self type\n\nand think it seems very promising. On the one hand, it covers the most important impl patterns we want to cover. On the other hand, it's relatively easy to think about: to a rough approximation, only the definer of a trait can give a blanket impl for `Self`; downstream crates must impl \"on\" a type defined in their crate. (Of course the full rule is more subtle, but that gets you most of the way there.)\n\nIt also means that the order of type parameters does not become significant for `impl` purposes _other_ than `Self` -- and `Self` is already special in various other ways.\n\nFinally, it seems plausible to extend this rule in the future, allowing traits to mark additional non-`Self` parameters as participating in the same locality checks.\n",
