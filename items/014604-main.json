  "body": "The current setup is to have a single vector of type parameters in\nscope at any one time. We then have to concatenate the parameters from\nthe impl/trait with those of the method. This makes a lot of things\nawkward, most notably associated fns (\"static fns\"). This branch\nrestructures the substitutions into three distinct namespaces (type,\nself, fn). This makes most of the \"type parameter management\"\ntrivial. This also sets us up to support UFCS (though I haven't made\nany particular changes in that direction in this patch).\n\nAlong the way, this patch fixes a few miscellaneous bits of code cleanup:\n1. Patch resolve to detect references to out-of-scope type parameters,\n   rather than checking for \"out of bound\" indices during substitution\n   (fixes #14603).\n2. Move def out of libsyntax into librustc where it belongs. I should have\n   moved DefId too, but didn't.\n3. Permit homogeneous tuples like `(T, T, T)` to be used as fixed-length\n   vectors like `[T, ..3]`. This is awfully handy, though public facing.\n   I suppose it requires an RFC.\n4. Add some missing tests.\n\ncc #5527\n\nr? @pcwalton or @pnkfelix \n",
