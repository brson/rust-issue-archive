    "body": "I think this is an important little feature which makes structuring your code considerably more comfortable in certain cases. But I'd like to suggest that we'd use the word `trust` instead of `friend`, because to me \"friend\" implies a bi-directional relation: \"X is a friend of Y\" implies also that \"Y is a friend of X\". Whereas `trust mod bar;` sounds like what it actually does, i.e. \"Entrust module bar with an access to your private items\".\n",
