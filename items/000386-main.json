  "body": "Hello Graydon,\n\nThis is a small patch that adds a simple vim indenter for rust. It's just defaulting to the c indenter for now since I think that's compatible with the rust grammar as far as I can tell. It also moves the syntax highlighter into a subdirectory so the vim files are better grouped.\n",
