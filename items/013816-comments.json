I couldn't find a good alternative to include those flags for all the crates, the only decent option I saw was to embed the flags in each crate, then include each one directly in librustc....but I couldn't think of a reason to mix crate flags. Is that a common scenario?\n\nAlso, running `rustdoc --version bad_verbose_arg` outputs `task '<main>' failed at 'Box<Any>'`. I'm not sure of the reason, but it seems that calling (indirectly) librustc::driver::early_error from outside of librustc (librustdoc specifically) triggers it.\n",

I think this method of creating `BUILD_FLAGS` in the Makefiles is error prone, unlikely to capture all the flags passed on the command line. A better way to do this might be to have something like a `buildcmd!` macro. That said though, I would be more comfortable simply dropping that functionality for now, since adding a built-in macro is a big change.\n",
