    "body": "Oh, right. Ok, then in that case you would have to manually put in the `::unreachable()` call.\n\nI looked through the compiler and libraries and see ... a few cases, but only a handful. I guess it's a real case; and given that the cost of \"solving\" it is extremely low in terms of cognitive burden I won't resist further. I'd say I like brson's suggestion of making the trailing `while` optional, but I think it leads to grammatical ambiguity if you juxtapose it with another while loop. We could make that _grammatically_ illegal, but that's teaching the parser an unusual amount about control flow (nothing can come after a `repeat { ... }` loop?) and feels like trying to make two wrongs into a right.\n\nIf we solve this \"in the language\" I've a slight preference for an unadorned `loop { ... }` construct (and hey, it's a keyword in Sather). The word `forever` is misleading (especially if we usually `ret`, which we do) and too long anyways. I agree we could get to the same place teaching typestate about `while true`, but suspect people will be filing followup bugs asking us why we can't tell that `while a == b || a != b { ... }` is also an \"infinite loop\", and why don't we include a general boolean solver, and what kind of amateurs are we? I don't want to play that game.\n",
