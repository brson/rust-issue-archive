  "body": "Good morning all,\n\nThe main commit fixes a Cargo bug. It currently doesn't work in the local directory mode because it tries to make a ./.cargo/work directory before the .cargo gets made.\n\nAlso, in order to suppress the cargo warnings about failing to install the OSX .dSYM directories, I switched cargo to use `cp -r` instead of `cp`. I'm not sure if this is portable to windows though. We need to create our own recursive copy. I'll file a bug report for that.\n",
