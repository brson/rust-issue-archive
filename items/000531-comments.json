    "body": "In a lot of ways, I like this. There's really little reason spawn shouldn't be in the library, as far as I know right now. One advantage is that it makes it easier to have different variants of spawn. We could have the simple version, and then other ones for \"spawn in new thread\" or \"spawn on remote machine.\"\n\nOne concern I'd have is that we might be giving up information that the compiler has about the semantics of communication, which could inhibit some of our optimization opportunities. Also, for the moment rust is doing a deep copy of data structures for spawn arguments and messages. This may not be something we actually need to do, but if we do need it, could we still do it nicely in a library?\n",
