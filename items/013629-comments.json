    "body": "Consider the example given above and the one below:\n\n``` rust\npub trait T1 {}\npub struct S;\nimpl T1 for S {}\n\npub trait Runtime {\n    fn spawn_sibling(&self) -> Box<T1:Send>;\n}\n\npub struct Foo;\nimpl Runtime for Foo {\n    fn spawn_sibling(&self) -> Box<T1> {\n        box S as Box<T1>\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nIntuitively, they are both wrong. But currently rustc accepts the former and rejects the latter. The reasoning here seems to be: in the first example, `f` is at a contra-variant position, in order to be compatible, the argument being used in the implementation (`proc()`) must be contra-variant to the one being used in the trait definition (`proc():Send`), i.e. `proc():Send <: proc()`, which happens to be true. In the second example, the type in question is at a co-variant position, but `Box<T1> <: Box<T:Send>` is not true, thus an error.\n\nSo by the usual variance rule, the current behavior is actually correct! Very counter-intuitive. I'm not sure why built-in bounds here makes an exception to the variance rule.\n",

The original goal was to permit impls to act as a kind of _refinement_, so that in cases where we did know the static type, we could use the tighter types from the impl, rather than the more generic types from the trait, but I don't think this is how our method resolution will work anyway.
