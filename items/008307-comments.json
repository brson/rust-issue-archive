    "body": "@brson mostly what I was wondering about is whether it's better to have an Option with an aliased getopt-option or a vector of aliased getopt-options for every getopt-option. (Where getopt-option is a getopt::Opt, not option::Option.. this is confusing). I guess it's not a huge deal because you won't likely have a gazillion of those in a process, but I assume an empty vector uses more memory than a None?\n",
