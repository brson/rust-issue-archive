The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @huonw (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

My version tries to keep code size small and avoid regressions for small numbers. In addition to that it also reduces 64 arithmetic.\n\nAlso note that the biggest increase in speed from lut to branchlut/countlut in that repo are due to avoiding the double buffering, which we can't really avoid in rust due to the fmt machinery.\n",
