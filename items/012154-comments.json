    "body": "This is the revised version of PR #12141 ; note that there was some discussion on that PR regarding the motivation for this change.  (The big one being enabling faster iteration on bigint improvements such as pnkfelix/rust@d669822aa6a17e83b84bbd9237a09d9b7f0e7142 )\n\nIn particular, I continue to assert that the decision of whether to change the defaults so that `bigint` is based on GMP is orthogonal to the changes proposed here.\n\nThe question of whether to remove `bigint` entirely is a separate question, but I'm going to leave it aside for now.  (I think removing `bigint` entirely will be a more reasonable option once we have deployed a replacement for `rustpkg`, but until then I think we should keep a `bigint` implementation here for now.)\n",

Really?  There should be a way to support running `rustc` in general from the build tree without installing it though, maybe I just need to find the right invocation command line.)\n\n(edit^2: wait, that command line above isn't running `rustc` out of the build tree anyway, its grabbing it from my path.  ugh, wake up felix...)\n",
