    "body": "@kwantam, I'm not sure you're aware of this, but NFC support has previously been rejected (because of the amount of data required to implement it).\nI was told it should be implemented in a separate libunicode, which now exists. The premise as I understand it was that `str` should be usable without linking to the unicode crate at all. It does indeed seem sensible to me that, since we have a libunicode, all Unicode algorithms would live there, and not just some of them (or just the data for some of them).\nI have not thought this through, but I think it should be possible to have libcollections not depend on libunicode at all (breaking-change though). However, I'd rather do that as a separate PR. It seems to me that adding nfc/nfkc next to the pre-existing nfd/nfkd should be fine for now.\n",

If we imported `str` from libcollections into libunicode and from there into stdlib (like `char`, which goes core->unicode->std), then libunicode inherits from libcollections, but not vice-versa.\n\nAs it is now, core and unicode both contribute functionality to collections, which then re-exports to std; that is, I think, what makes this whole thing seem like a bit of a mess.\n\nI also agree regarding your other point: we can do this change in either order, so from my point of view integrating compositions first and then doing rearrangement in a separate PR should be fine.\n\nBut of course my opinion isn't the one that counts! @alexcrichton, thoughts?\n",
