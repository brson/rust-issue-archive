The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @alexcrichton (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

Do you think guys think it makes sense to move forward with a partial fix here? Or wait until we refactor the trans-based impl away? I'm not a big fan of trying really hard to make the trans-based code work, though maybe that IS more prudent. (Since I don't know whether anyone has time or bandwidth to spearhead an effort to reshape the constant evaluator, though @oli-obk given all your work in this area lately maybe we should try to touch base on that. I'd be eternally grateful. :))\n",
