    "body": "I'm currently working on a PR that makes use of LLVM's `byval` attribute. That would at least make the code a bit shorter because the address of the copy is implicitly passed because it's a fixed offset from the stack pointer. With that, `foo` is translated to:\n\n``` asm\n    subq    $24, %rsp\n.Ltmp4:\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 32\n    movaps  32(%rsp), %xmm0\n    movups  %xmm0, (%rsp)\n    callq   _ZN3bar20h6b5879ee29f32fdeeaaE@PLT\n    movaps  32(%rsp), %xmm0\n    movups  %xmm0, (%rsp)\n    callq   _ZN3bar20h6b5879ee29f32fdeeaaE@PLT\n    addq    $24, %rsp\n    retq\n```\n\nAnd some other improvements also happen, I'll detail them with the PR, once I get the last few bugs fixed.\n\nIn a later step, we could definitely look into additional improvements like just dropping the `byval` flag for functions that are known not to modify their argument.\n",

    "body": "The rust ABI isn't good at it, yet. That's why I'm working on the patch to change it.\n\nThe thing with the first iteration of my patch is that it translates `fn foo(s: &str)` to `declare void @foo({ i8*, i64 })` instead of `declare void @foo(i8*, i64)`. It works to some degree, because LLVM happens to pass each struct field as if it was a distinct argument, so at the asm level you get the desired results (at least on x86 and x86_64), but the LLVM function passes get almost 40% slower, which I suspect to happen due to LLVM not handling FCA arguments that well. We might also miss some optimizations that way. We dropped FCA loads/stores a while ago because of that.\n",

    "body": "Oh, now I see. No, LLVM doesn't automatically handle ABI compliance. It only handles calling conventions. For example, we used to pass a struct consisting of 4 u8 values (think RGBA) directly as the struct type. LLVM did pass the 4 values as 4 individual arguments. But the x86_64 SysV ABI (and by now the rust ABI, too) wants that struct to be passed as a single u32 value. And it's the frontend's (i.e. our) job to handle that.\n",
