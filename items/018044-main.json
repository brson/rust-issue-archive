  "body": "[RFC 344](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/344) proposes a set of naming conventions for lints. This PR\nrenames existing lints to follow the conventions.\n\nUse the following sed script to bring your code up to date:\n\n```\ns/unnecessary_typecast/unused_typecasts/g\ns/unsigned_negate/unsigned_negation/g\ns/type_limits/unused_comparisons/g\ns/type_overflow/overflowing_literals/g\ns/ctypes/improper_ctypes/g\ns/owned_heap_memory/box_pointers/g\ns/unused_attribute/unused_attributes/g\ns/path_statement/path_statements/g\ns/unused_must_use/unused_must_use/g\ns/unused_result/unused_results/g\ns/non_uppercase_statics/non_upper_case_globals/g\ns/unnecessary_parens/unused_parens/g\ns/unnecessary_import_braces/unused_import_braces/g\ns/unused_unsafe/unused_unsafe/g\ns/unsafe_block/unsafe_blocks/g\ns/unused_mut/unused_mut/g\ns/unnecessary_allocation/unused_allocation/g\ns/missing_doc/missing_docs/g\ns/unused_imports/unused_imports/g\ns/unused_extern_crate/unused_extern_crates/g\ns/unnecessary_qualification/unused_qualifications/g\ns/unrecognized_lint/unknown_lints/g\ns/unused_variable/unused_variables/g\ns/dead_assignment/unused_assignments/g\ns/unknown_crate_type/unknown_crate_types/g\ns/variant_size_difference/variant_size_differences/g\ns/transmute_fat_ptr/fat_ptr_transmutes/g\n```\n\nSince a large number of lints are being renamed for RFC 344, this PR\nadds some basic deprecation/renaming functionality to the pluggable lint\nsystem. It allows a simple mapping of old to new names, and can warn\nwhen old names are being used.\n\nThis change needs to be rolled out in stages. In this PR, the\ndeprecation warning is commented out, but the old name is forwarded to\nthe new one.\n\nOnce the PR lands and we have generated a new snapshot of the\ncompiler, we can add the deprecation warning and rename all uses of the\nlints in the rust codebase. I will file a PR to do so.\n\nCloses #16545\nCloses #17932\n\nr? @pcwalton \n",
