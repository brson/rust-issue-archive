The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @huonw (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

None of those on the libs team felt strongly enough to push through an RFC rather than just accepting this PR, but you should feel free to do so if you prefer. I'd be glad to help you with the RFC process.\n",
