The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @steveklabnik (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Hey @steveklabnik! Thanks for your ultra-prompt response. I think what got me was that I _started_ with [Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com/hello/print.html) and then switched over to the book, and RBE doesn't use 'main.rs' as the file name. \n\nWhat do you think about putting something in the error message? Cargo is throwing a 'parse exception' here, I would never have known that \"main.rs\" was a special name based on the error message. I think that people coming from other package managers might be a little thrown by this error message, and the the name convention--AFAIK, neither npm nor maven have a similar convention (and those are the two package managers with which I'm most familiar).\n\nAnywho, thanks again. I really like what I'm seeing so far (my favorite is default immutability + 'mut' modifier. very straightforward)\n",
