  "body": "The fix is straight-forward, but there are several changes\nwhile fixing the issue.\n\n1) disallow `mut` keyword when making a new struct\n\nIn code base, there are following code,\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo { mut a: int };\nlet a = Foo { mut a: 1 };\n```\n\nThis is because of structural record, which is\ndeprecated corrently (see issue #3089) In structural\nrecord, `mut` keyword should be allowd to control\nmutability. But without structural record, we don't\nneed to allow `mut` keyword while constructing struct.\n\n2) disallow structural records in parser level\nThis is related to 1). With structural records, there\nis an ambiguity between empty block and empty struct\nTo solve the problem, I change parser to stop parsing\nstructural records. I think this is not a problem,\nbecause structural records are not compiled already.\n\nMisc. issues\n\nThere is an ambiguity between empty struct vs. empty match stmt.\nwith following code,\n\n``` rust\nmatch x{} {}\n```\n\nTwo interpretation is possible, which is listed blow\n\n``` rust\nmatch (x{}) {} //  matching with newly-constructed empty struct\n(match x{}) {}  //  matching with empty enum(or struct) x\n                //  and then empty block\n```\n\nIt seems that there is no such code in rust code base, but\nthere is one test which uses empty match statement:\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/incoming/src/test/run-pass/issue-3037.rs\n\nAll other cases could be distinguished with look-ahead,\nbut this can't be. One possible solution is wrapping with\nparentheses when matching with an uninhabited type.\n\n``` rust\nenum what { }\nfn match_with_empty(x: what) -> ~str {\n    match (x) { //use parentheses to remove the ambiguity\n    }\n}\n```\n",
