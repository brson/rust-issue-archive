Maybe you are thinking of `open()` but that is the POSIX way, not the C one.\n\nLet me cite \"man 3 fopen\":\n\n> Any created files will have mode S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH (0666), as modified by the process's umask value (see umask(2)).\n\nAbout forcing the user to set permission (`open()` does that), but `fopen()` does just fine without any mechanism to set permissions at all. It could be a good idea anyway, but remember that in Windows the permissions work quite differently, so maybe there is no easy equivalent.\n",
