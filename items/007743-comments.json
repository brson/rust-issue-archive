    "body": "@lilac the reason I was vague is because I don't actually know the process that will be required. Approximately, with all the details glossed over:\n1. make the change, but do it such that stage 1 `libsyntax` still uses `ident`s for lifetime names, but the `quote` implementations (in stage 1) should use `Name`s. (This will probably require devious hackery.)\n2. take/wait for [a snapshot](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-compiler-snapshots), so that the new  stage 0 compiler has the `ident` -> `Name` change in it.\n3. Finally remove the stuff about `ident`s.\n\nI have literally no idea if step 1 is even possible. It looks like this issue is more than 20 minutes. :(\n\n(Oh, it's unfortunate that no-one responded :( you could try again during US-daytime hours, I probably won't be there (wrong timezone), but people who know more than will be around. You may need to ask a few times for help; preferably linking to this issue to make it easy for someone to jump in.)\n",
