    "body": "I've been looking into this and it looks really painful for rustpkg to actually check the file modification times. These files are actually loaded by the parser (!) and there's no record saved of what files were used to build the AST for a crate.\n\nRustpkg could walk the AST and duplicate the parser's logic to track down those external modules, but that seems sketchy, especially since I don't think it's possible to determine if the current module was an external or internal one at that point. What I think makes more sense is to hash the AST itself and compare that to the old version. This is nice since it takes care of #6522 as well.\n",
