    "body": "Here's what I have after some code exploration:\n\nThere is already a search index that is being built by rustdoc at generation time. This contains a list of items and paths (an item can be a function, a struct, a field etc.). There is quite some search logic written to query this index.\n\nSince we have access to the AST while building the index, I'm thinking that we should also build a mapping from `function type` (probably represented as string) to `[item id]` (where such an id is probaby an index in the items list in the existing index. This mapping would be stored in the `types` field (sibling of `items` and `paths`).\n\nThen, when the search query is performed, if the query contains `->` we look in the `types` dict. Otherwise, the old flow is preserved.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n",

    "body": "I think that that\u2019s generally a good way of doing it, although I\u2019m not sure that a string-based signature mapping would be a good idea; I think there are a few subtle cases that need to be handled here that might not interact so well with a text-based system. Certainly, not all of them need to be done straight away for a first implementation, but they\u2019d still be nice in the long term:\n- A function like `fn foo<T>(x: T) -> T` should show up when someone searches for (for example) `fn(int) -> int`, but also for the more general `fn<T>(T) -> T`.\n- There needs to be a certain amount of non-textual fuzzy matching: for example, lifetimes and trait bounds should be able to be omitted, references and other pointers should be elidable, etc.. However, more closely matching things should be favoured over others: if a user searched for `fn(T) -> T`, results like `Float::sqrt` (`fn(f64) -> f64`) should show up before results like `Clone::clone` (`fn<T>(&T) -> T`).\n- Type parameter names should be interchangeable. `fn<T>(T) -> T` is the same as `fn<U>(U) -> U`.\n- Traits\u2019 methods would ideally be searchable as generic functions. So `Iterator::next` would be `fn<Self, A>(&mut Self) -> Option<A>`. Inherent methods are the same: `fn map<T, U>(Option<T>, |T| -> U) -> Option<U>` It would also be nice if methods could _also_ be searched using `self`, implicitly meaning any type (so `fn<T>(self) -> T` could satisfy `Option::unwrap`, for example).\n- Implicit single-letter type parameters would also be nice, so that `fn(self) -> T` could find `Option::unwrap`.\n- Paths should be able to be qualified partially or fully: so one could write `std::option::Option`, `option::Option` or simply `Option`.\n\nObviously, _all_ of this shouldn\u2019t have to be done for a first implementation; in fact, none of it really has to be done. But I think it\u2019d be best to design a scheme with this in mind such that adding these features in the future will not require a complete restructuring of the system.\n\nThis is quite a tricky task, though, because half of the searching functionality is done on the client, in Javascript. I think that verbose, fully-expanded-with-lots-of-details signatures should be output to the index, and then the Javascript code would have to parse the query as a function signature, and if successful, search the index for things that roughly match the inputted function\u2019s signature. I think doing this textually might not be such a good idea, but I\u2019m not sure. Later, the function signature from the search query could be varied in a number of ways to take into account some of the things I listed above (and maybe others).\n\nI think performance is a bit of a worry, though\u2014loading the existing index already takes a long time. On my system, clearing the cache and reloading the standard library\u2019s docs takes three seconds to download the index alone, which is ~1 MB in size.\n",

    "body": "Neal Mitchell has written some things about the various iterations of Hoogle (and lessons learned), which would probably be useful as reference. \n\nIn writing the (now outdated to the point of uselessness) simple version of this at https://github.com/dbp/rustle , one thing that turned out to be important to get useful ordering of results was to progressively generalize the query and order the results based on that. \n\nSo `uint -> uint` is searched directly, then `T -> T` and then `T -> U` (though since the latter can't be fulfilled by a useful function, perhaps don't generalize that far). \n\nAlso, instead of searching for `T`, come up with some representation of type variables that is easier to match. What rustle did, which I was never all that happy with (but is better than nothing), was to treat them as ordinals, ranked by frequency (so a `T -> U -> T` function would be `1 -> 2 -> 1` essentially, and a `U -> T -> U` function would turn into the same thing), with ties constructing multiple entries. \n",

    "body": "FWIW, I took a look yesterday at dumping a stylized type signature from RustDoc that Hoogle can then read in, which allows us to reuse all the fancy type search algorithms Hoogle uses (retrieval, selective generalization, canonicalization, scoring, etc).  It seems to work OK as a demo with even just a simple implementation (~200 lines in `librustdoc`, ~200 lines in Hoogle). \n\n![example](http://i.imgur.com/mdiCh9R.png)\n\nhttps://github.com/ajtulloch/roogle has some more documentation on the approach, usage instructions, and examples (along with the Hoogle changes), and https://github.com/ajtulloch/rust has the `librustdoc` changes.\n\nThe main missing features (relative to Hoogle for Haskell) are:\n- links to `doc.rust-lang.org` for search results\n- more complete rustdoc integration, so all function/methods/traits/aliases are exported to Hoogle\n- more precise translation of the Rust type system\n  - Handling of `mut T` vs `T`\n  - `&T` vs `T`\n  - `T: Eq + Num` vs unbounded generics, etc.\n",
