  "body": "This is an attempt of fixing #12925.\n\nThis PR moves almost all trait implementations for primitive types ((), bool, char, i_, u_, f*) near trait definitions. Only Float trait implementations weren't moved because they heavily rely on constants defined in f32.rs and f64.rs.\n\nSome trait implementations had cfg(not(test)) attribute. I suspect it's because of issue 2912.\nStill, someone who knows the problem better should probably check this code.\n\nCloses #12925\n",
