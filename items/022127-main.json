  "body": "There are a number of holes that the stability lint did not previously cover,\nincluding:\n- Types\n- Bounds on type parameters on functions and impls\n- Where clauses\n- Imports\n- Patterns (structs and enums)\n\nThese holes have all been fixed by overriding the `visit_path` function on the\nAST visitor instead of a few specialized cases. This change also necessitated a\nfew stability changes:\n- The `collections::fmt` module is now stable (it was already supposed to be).\n- The `thread_local::imp::Key` type is now stable (it was already supposed to\n  be).\n- The `std::rt::{begin_unwind, begin_unwind_fmt}` functions are now stable.\n  These are required via the `panic!` macro.\n- The `std::old_io::stdio::{println, println_args}` functions are now stable.\n  These are required by the `print!` and `println!` macros.\n- The `ops::{FnOnce, FnMut, Fn}` traits are now `#[stable]`. This is required to\n  make bounds with these traits stable. Note that manual implementations of\n  these traits are still gated by default, this stability only allows bounds\n  such as `F: FnOnce()`.\n\nCloses #8962\nCloses #16360\nCloses #20327\n",
