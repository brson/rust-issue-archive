    "body": "@alfie Sure. I agree it could be worded more clearly.\n\nJust for clarification, the undefined behavior comes from dereferencing a _null_ pointer which even `unsafe` code is not allowed to do. `unsafe` code is allows to dereference raw pointers, which might not be valid, the point being that the `unsafe` code does additional work that the compiler can track to ensure that it does not dereference a raw pointer which might be null or dangling.\n\nThe idea with `unsafe` is that it is possible to shoot yourself in the foot and invoke undefined behavior, but you must not do so - `unsafe` is meant to signify that you are doing something safe\\* but the compiler cannot verify that it is safe for you.\n\n\\* I recognize the irony ;)\n",
