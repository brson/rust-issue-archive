Can we do something to make it more prominent?\n\n>  I didn't feel confident to jump in and do it myself (yet?).\n\nMost of that stuff relates to code changes. The book workflow is largely just \"please send in a PR.\" We do have some standards, but that's exactly what review is for, so don't worry about it too much.\n",

Of course, other people could join in too. I'd love to contribute to this.\n\n\ud83c\udf89\n",
