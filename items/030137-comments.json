This seems like wrong behaviour. Also, the suggested\n\n`````` rust\n///```\n///extern crate mylib;\n///use self::mylib::foo;\n///foo('bar');\n///```\n``````\n\ndoes not work either, I don't know if there is an RFC or issue open about attempting to resolve the names suggested under `Did you mean `...`?` and only showing them if they exist.\n\nEDIT: as mentioned below, this is _not_ a bug with rustc or cargo, it's just that there is no way to refer to the current function scope in a use statement if you import a crate into it.\n",
