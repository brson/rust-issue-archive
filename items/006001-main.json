  "body": "Specifically: all enums with two variants, where one has zero size (and thus at most one inhabitant) and the other has a field where the null value would not be allowed (such as a safe pointer), are now represented by storing a null pointer in the field in question.\n\nThis is a generalization of representing `Option<~T>`, `Option<@T>`, and `Option<&T>` with nullable pointers, thus fixing Tony Hoare's \u201cbillion dollar mistake\u201d.\n",
