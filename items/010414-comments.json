    "body": "There are other circumstances in which negative bounds would be nice. In this particular case, it's a shame that you'd need to have identical implementations of `next()` in both impls, only differing in `size_hint()`. It would be really nice if there was some way to partially specialize the implementation, such that if you have\n\n```\nimpl<T: Ord> Foo for Bar<T> { ... }\n```\n\nthen you could say\n\n```\nimpl<T: Ord+ToPrimitive> Foo for Bar<T> { ... }\n```\n\nand selectively re-implement only the methods that you care to do; anything not implemented would use the \"parent\"'s implementation.\n\nNaturally, this falls down if you then say\n\n```\nimpl<T: Ord+Quux> Foo for Bar<T> { ... }\n```\n\nand some type implements both `ToPrimitive` and `Quux`. But surely there must be some alternative way to solve this. Perhaps some way to simply test within the implementation block if `T` implements `ToPrimitive` and only implement `size_hint()` if it does.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimpl<T> Iterator<T> for Range<T> {\n    fn next() -> Option<T> { ... }\n    if!<T: ToPrimitive> {\n        fn size_hint() -> (uint, Option<uint>) { ... }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOr maybe something like this:\n\n```\nimpl<T> Iterator<T> for Range<T> {\n    fn next() -> Option<T> { ... }\n    fn<R: T+ToPrimitive> size_hint() -> (uint, Option<uint>) { ... }\n    // in this case, size_hint() must either have a default impl, or a second impl using negative trait bounds must be provided\n}\n```\n",
