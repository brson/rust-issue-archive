    "body": "> There is nothing stopping @mut from aliasing with &mut\n\nThey might alias (i.e. point at the same memory), but if a `@mut` is borrowed as `&mut` there is no way to actually observe any changes to the contents of the `@mut`: the dynamic borrow check will prohibit all of them (without `unsafe` code, that is). Similarly for TLS, if it's been borrowed as `&mut` then the TLS dynamic borrow checker will fail on any attempt to access that piece of memory. I would think this satisfies the definition of LLVM's NoAlias (since the `@mut` pointer can never actually be dereferenced/read/written to).\n\n``` rust\nfn at_and(x: &mut int, y: @mut int) {\n    *x += 1;\n    printfln!(*y);\n}\n\nfn at_at(x: @mut int, y: @mut int) {\n     *x += 1;\n    printfln!(*y);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = @mut 1;\n    at_at(x, x); // prints 2\n    at_and(x, x); // the *y fails\n}\n```\n\nThat said, I agree that there are too many special cases for a simplistic implementation like this bug.\n",
