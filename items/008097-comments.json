    "body": "@alco, please chime in with your own comparison if I misstate anything. I'm trying to just state the facts and I'm not trying to recommend one implementation over the other here, so if anything I write gives that impression, it is unintentional.\n- @alco has an implementation of MD4, however, its not integrated into his MD5 implementation (at least not in his public repo). So, essentially, its the same as mine in that regard.\n- My implementation makes use of the new functionality I included in this patch series, his does not. So, merging in this request would mean that his implementation should be updated since I wouldn't think it would make sense to merge in new functionality that seeks to be the basis for future digests and then merge a digest that doesn't use that functionality. If the functionality in this pull request looks good and is merged, there isn't any reason it couldn't be integrated into his implementation.\n- My implementation completely unrolls the loops in the compression function, while his does not. I have no idea how the implementations compare performance wise. I have benchmarks for the performance of my implementation, but, I don't know if LLVM will generate better code with the loops unrolled (as in mine) or left alone (as in his).\n\nThe goal of my MD5 implementation was to be a demonstration that the new functionality I was implementing was usable for digests outside of Sha2. Anyway, what I'm going to do is update this pull request to rebase out the MD5 implementation and instead integrate the new functionality into the existing Sha1 implementation.\n",
