    "body": "Thanks for the PR @spersson! We're actually taking quite a close look at API stabilization for the standard library right now, so this is well timed! I haven't taken too much time to pore over this module, but we may want to hold off on incremental improvements before scrutinizing the entire module at once. It is interesting, for example, that a function is called `main_program` but returns a library and that the public `dl::open_external` or `dl::open_internal` don't match this naming convention.\n\nFor now would you be ok with holding off on this for now? We may not want to stabilize this module for the next release cycle, but we may want to look at it in some of the following ones! \n",

I was also thinking that there could be more changes needed but wanted to start small with my first contribution.\nAnd yeah, if the lower level functions open_external and open_internal should stay public they should probably have consistent naming. Oh, and of course I'm not sure about the name \"main_program\". I got the term from the dlopen man page...\n\nYou can decide if you want to close this PR or keep it as a place to discuss this API.\nThanks!\n",

    "body": "Sorry this kinda fell under the radar @spersson! I think for now we're going to want to keep focusing on other parts of the standard library and leave modules like this for later as they're not quite as widely used. For now we're at least keeping the same set of functionality, so I'm going to close this to help prevent unnecessary churn until we have time to sit down to think about this. Regardless though, thanks for the PR!\n",
