    "body": "Unwinding is implemented in `libgcc_s` and `libsupc++` (often part of `libstdc++`) only exposes the C++ exception personality for it. There are plans to implement unwinding directly in the LLVM project, but it will probably only work on OS X at first. It already implements the C++ part of the equation with `libc++abi` but has to call out to `libgcc_s` on Linux and I guess with mingw too.\n",
