    "body": "Ok, my findings so far:\n- On Windows, importing data symbols from dynamic libraries requires the compiler to generate code with an extra level of indirection via IAT, so all such variables need to be marked up with __declspec(dllimport) attribute.\n- Gnu ld plays tricks with COFF import tables that allow one to avoid the above requirement (in most cases). This feature is called \"auto-import\".  Explained [here](http://blog.omega-prime.co.uk/?p=115).  \n- In some cases this trick doesn't work, so ld falls back to [\"pseudo-relocations\"](http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-apps/2002-06/msg00276.html), which are a linker-generated table of fixups, processed just after DLL is loaded by code coming from mingw runtime library (that's the _pei386_runtime_relocator function I mentioned above).\n- Mingw's \"relocator\" code is pretty inefficient when it comes across fixups pointing into read-only image sections,- it calls VirtualProtect() twice for every such fixup.\n- Originally, pseudo-relocations were used only as a fall-back, so there were very few of them and relocator performance didn't matter.\n- Some time later, pseudo-relocations v2 [were introduced](https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2008-11/msg00004.html).  For reasons not completely clear to me, v2 code uses pseudo-relocs for  _all_ data imports, not just for the \"hard\" cases.\n- Later yet, again, for reasons not completely clear to me, pseudo-relocs v2 [had been made](https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2009-11/msg00107.html) the default in ld.  \n- Now we have a problem: ld generates lots of pseudo-relocs, and mingw runtime is very slow in processing them.  In librustc alone I counted more than 10,000 pseudo-reloc entries.\n\nWhat can be done:\n- The quickest fix is to pass --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc-v1 switch to the linker, which enables the original ld behavior.  Empirically, it appears to work just as well as -v2, but reduces the number of pseudo-relocs 200-fold, so now rustc starts up on my machine in 0.06 seconds, as compared to 1.70s before.  \"make check\" now takes ~360s instead of ~900s (60% reduction).\n- _However_ the original author of pseudo-relocs-v2 ld patch [advices against doing this](http://www.cygwin.com/ml/binutils/2012-03/msg00360.html).  I actually emailed Kai about this, but so far I could not understand from his responses what exactly might go wrong.  \n  Anyways, he recommends using mingw-w64 instead, where the slow relocator issue apparently has already been fixed.\n",
