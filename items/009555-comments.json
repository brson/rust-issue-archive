    "body": "I think `range(a, b)` where `a > b` should work. It seems strange to write extra code for steps (`range_step`), inversions (`invert`), or mutable variables (`i = i - 1`) just to make a basic countdown. Countdowns seem common enough that a programming language should provide a succinct way to make them. In any event, these other solutions work well enough, so I'm not going to press the point.\n\nWith that said, I still think that some change ought to be made. If my suggestion is not implemented, then `range()` should probably be changed so that the programmer is informed that the function is not meant to be used that way. As it stands, the function feels incomplete, perhaps buggy, because it gives no return value, no compilation error, no runtime error, no warning, no suggestion, no nothing. Functions should be black boxes, not black holes =P.\n",

    "body": "The source of my confusion has become clear.\n\nWhen you sit in the pub with a friend and hear them say \"the people I have dated range from skinny to fat\" or \"the people I have dated range from fat to skinny\", you would understand both statements as referring to the same group of people, just put in a different order. This is the plain language sense of the term \"range\" and that is how I tried to understand `range()`. \n\nConsider the two code examples at the top of this issue. The intention was to loop through every possible value that an unsigned byte could have: 0 to 255. Because I had the plain language \"range\" in mind, my first attempt at writing the code was `for i in range(0, 255)`, which I thought would be equivalent to `for i in range(255, 0)`. If `range()` worked as I expected, both codes would have worked without flaw.\n\nThat code did not work. From the output, the needed change was obvious: `for i in range(0, 256)`, which I thought would be equivalent to `for i in range(255, -1)`. This seemed strange, because 256 and -1 were not possible values for an unsigned byte. The code looked convoluted and ugly, but it seemed to work. For some reason or another, I decided to rewrite the code to what I thought was its equivalent `for i in range(255, -1)` and found that it did not work at all: no output, no error, no warning, no nothing. That compounded the ugliness.\n\nKnowing that `range()` indicates a half-closed interval dispels my earlier confusion about the values to use as parameters, but still seems convoluted and ugly. Why have a function for half-closed intervals, but not plain language ranges? Why have a tutorial that teaches people to use half-closed intervals for loops when such loops cannot do everything programmers want? Why are half-closed intervals called ranges instead of intervals? And why does it ask for a half-closed interval, instead of a completely closed interval? (I am here referring back to the semantics issue.) These decisions are all kind of weird.\n\nCan we reach a compromise? The most straight-forward solution would be renaming `range()` to `interval()` and perhaps reworking the code so it uses completely closed intervals, and then write a new `range()` that captures the plain language sense of the term. This solution would be the most straight-forward, but it could be disorienting for the current users of Rust, so perhaps another solution would be better?\n",

    "body": "Rust uses 0-indexed arrays and the `range` function is a good fit for that since you can give the length directly as the `end` parameter without needing to subtract one and handle underflow for 0-length arrays. This is the same definition used by `range` in Python, `irange` in Boost, and `iota` in D.  There's a `range_inclusive` function for inclusive ranges.\n\nI don't think it's worth changing the default, because it's already the most familiar definition for those coming from other languages with 0-indexed arrays.\n",

    "body": "see also #1817 , some discussion of range_rev on #4313, and discussion of the semantics for `range_rev` on #5270, namely about what kind of half-open interval it should represent.\n\n(Of course the `range_rev` internal iterator routine went away with the shift to external-iterators; but I thought some of the discussion on those tickets was relevant, e.g. about whether to make reverse iteration a separate function or to infer the step from the arguments. )\n\nIn my opinion inferring the step from the arguments would be a bad move, at least for our half-open intervals.  (It would be easier to accept for `range_inclusive`, except that then `range_inclusive` would deviate from `range` in more ways than one would expect.\n\nI think we should close this ticket as not-a-bug.  As @thestinger said, the precedent for the method name `range` has been established, and one can use the `invert` method to switch the direction of the iteration to get the effect of `range_rev`.\n",

Of course, it's one of those things that once you know, you look out for. But so is integer overflow, and we don't just assume that everyone is on the lookout for those. Mistakes can be made, and the whole reason so many people are looking at Rust right now is because Rust often gives up convenience for the sake of safety.\n\nIf you're ever writting code that involves a bunch of ranges, and you know what you're doing, you can turn the warning off. Just like sometimes I preffer to have unused_variable turned off, but sometimes it helps me catch a bug.\n",
