  "body": "Whenever a failure happens, if a program is run with\n`RUST_LOG=std::rt::backtrace` a backtrace will be printed to the task's stderr\nhandle. Stack traces are uncondtionally printed on double-failure and\nrtabort!().\n\nCloses #10128\n\n---\n\nThis PR is an improvement over the previous iteration in a few ways:\n- This now works on all platforms\n- This works on green threads as well as native threads\n\nI have yet to actually get symbols from backtraces on windows, but at this point I'm convinced that it's something wrong my my VM installation. All documentation and examples I can find point to doing almost exactly what's impemented. The good news is that the only part in question for the windows implementation is the address => symbol translation (stack walking is working just fine).\n",
