    "body": "These examples so far seem to be \"working as designed\". That is, we do not do fallback early in the cycle, but only after we've gotten to the end, and we currently do require some type-directed actions (like field access) to have resolved types, for better or worse. We could do work on the type system to make it less... eager. In other words, it should generate deferred constraints and try to solve them. That is sort of the general fix to this problem I guess.\n",

I suspect this is eminently doable.
