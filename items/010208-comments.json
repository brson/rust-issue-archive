    "body": "It's probably also worth mentioning that the other main reason for having this hash was to throw the type signature into the hash. Then in theory if you change the symbol's type you would prevent linking against the new crate with crates linked against the old version. That being said, our \"in-place update\" system is so broken as is (see #10207), that this is the least of our concerns.\n\nI personally like the idea of this becoming the strict version hash instead of the crate metadata hash because if symbol names become truly not determined by node ids then we could very realistically run into this problem by accident. By using the SVH (which is extremely sensitive to crate changes), then we're still guaranteeing that you can't link against old versions of libraries.\n",
