The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @aturon (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

I'm totally fine with the f32 -> f64 conversion (pending my question above), and the others seem relatively natural to add.\n",

The only thing I didn't try was subnormal state -- I _think_ the exponents work out such that all subnormal f32 values are still normal in f64.
