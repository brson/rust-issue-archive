    "body": "> As an interim step, the compiler should continue to accept extern crate \"foo-bar\" as ...\n\nBased on the latest rustc, this is not working.  It is still looking for a target named \"foo-bar\" when it should be looking for \"foo_bar\".  By changing that line to `extern crate foo_bar as ...` it works.  Appropriate warnings are produced regarding this change, but it does seem to be breaking builds at the moment.\n",
