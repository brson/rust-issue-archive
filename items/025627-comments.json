    "body": "@alexcrichton: I'd be glad to put my name on it and be the one responsible for fixing it whenever it breaks. As it's basically a thin wrapper around the LLVM API, I don't anticipate much future breakage.\n\nAs for stability concerns, the use of `ExecutionEngine` is directly dependent upon public `rustc` APIs that process Rust code and produce a `rustc_llvm::ModuleRef`. As such, the stability of these low-level APIs is effectively tied to that of the public `rustc` API.\nI've considered developing a high-level API that could become stable (while internally depending upon unstable APIs), but I don't think that rusti is yet sufficiently feature complete for this to be a viable plan at this time. Implementation of major features will likely require changes to `rustc` APIs that would enable deeper access to information produced during the compile process.\n",

Also, I don't know what changes have been applied to Rust's LLVM fork and what problems may arise from interactions between Rust's LLVM and a mainline LLVM library.\n\nThe use of `rustc*` crates is unavoidable. The compiler functions are needed to produce compiled code without linking having taken place. Rusti also makes use of `CrateAnalysis` and at least one planned feature would require more access to the resolver during compilation.\n\nIf a full-featured REPL (which Rusti is not yet) is still a goal for Rust, it seems reasonable to me to provide support for such a thing at least until some future possible breakage actually happens. As long as the `rustc_llvm` crate remains unstable, there is no guarantee that the `ExecutionEngine` API must exist or function correctly into the future. I would also note that at least one upgrade of LLVM has happened since the introduction of the `ExecutionEngine` wrapper API and only a handful of lines were changed in the C++ wrapper code.\n",
