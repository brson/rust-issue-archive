    "body": "I have a prototype for this. However, I stumbled upon a GDB peculiarity while working on the implementation. GDB seems to use the _linkage_name_ attribute (if present) to find out which namespace a function is in. That is, it de-mangles the linkage name to produce `ABC::BBB::uuu` from `_ZN3ABC3BBB3uuuEv`. For C++ and Clang this works fine but _rustc_ adds a hash value and version number to the linkage name. If we were to use these actual names, GDB would display the above function as `void ABC::BBB::uuu::_723b201b7ff6bc3f::_0$x2e0(void)` which clearly can't be the way to go.\n\nIf the _linkage_name_ attribute is not present in the debug info, then GDB will display the name correctly. So, I would opt for not setting the _linkage_name_ instead of either\n  (1) setting it correctly and obfuscating object names in the process or\n  (2) setting it without the hash and version suffix, leading to incorrect information in the debug info.\n",

    "body": "OK, I've investigated this a bit more systematically now and I can't reproduce the 'no linkage name' behaviour. That is, with correct description of the namespace hierarchy but missing `DW_AT_linkage_name` attribute, GDB does _not_ display function names correctly.\n\nI've tested many different combinations and the only way to get GDB to display function names correctly seems to be via the linkage name attribute. That also means that we have to set the incorrect linkage name (missing hash and version number suffix).\n\nThere are still two design decisions to make that I would like to have some input on:\n(1) Should we create a namespace for the crate name too?\nE.g. should it be `ast::Block` or `syntax::ast::Block`? The first variant is more terse and correct most of the time but might lead to ambiguities in multi-crate scenarios.\n\n(2) Is it important to set the correct source line attribute for namespaces?\nDoing so would have quite some impact on the implementation because often it is necessary to create namespace entries for modules that have not been translated yet. However, we usually just have the `ast_map::path` to construct the entry from, which does not contain any code location information.\n\nI see three alternatives here: \n1. Always set the line attribute to zero because it is not that important.\n2. Add another table to the ast_map that allows to find the parent of an AST node.\n3. Do a translation _pre pass_ that only creates namespace entries and makes them easy to look up later.\n\nOption (1) would be the most simple but creates slightly incorrect debug info.\nOption (2) would increase the memory footprint and seems a bit heavy-handed.\nOption (3) slightly complicates the usage protocol for the debuginfo module and relies on the assumption that items declared within a function can't escape the declaring function's scope (which is true now, I think).\n\nI would prefer option (3). \n\nAny comments?\n",

    "body": "> Rust's lifetimes assure us that option 3's criterion will always hold, right?\n\nIn this case we are not concerned with values or references outliving the function scope they were defined in, but with types and functions not being visible outside the function they are defined in. For example, the following code is perfectly legal as far as the current rustc is concerned:\n\n``` rust\npub fn aaa() -> int {\n    pub mod bbb {\n        pub struct CCC {\n            x: int\n        }\n\n        pub fn ddd() -> CCC {\n            return CCC { x: 0 };\n        }\n    }\n\n    return bbb::ddd().x;\n}\n```\n\nThat is, we have a module defined in the body of a function. This module again can contain arbitrary items. This is fine for the pre-pass algorithm as long as it can stop whenever it encounters a function. But if the following code were legal, the pre-pass algorithm would also have to handle functions:\n\n``` rust\n// code from example above...\n\nfn xxx() -> aaa::bbb::CCC {\n   ...\n}\n```\n\nBut to fully instantiate function debug info, the pre-pass algorithm would also have to handle type debuginfo, which can lead to cyclic dependencies. This would make the whole algorithm a lot more complicated. Consider the following example:\n\n``` rust\nmod aaa {\n    fn bbb() -> ddd::eee::fff {\n        struct ccc { ... }    \n    }\n}\n\nmod ddd {\n    fn eee -> aaa::bbb::ccc {\n        struct fff { ... }\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe would start at `aaa`, then `aaa::bbb`, but for handling `aaa::bbb`, we would first have to handle `ddd::eee::fff`, so we have to remember that `aaa::bbb` is yet to handle and continue at `ddd`, then do `ddd::eee`. But here we need `aaa::bbb::ccc`, which can only be done after `aaa::bbb` is finished, which in turn is blocked `ddd::eee::fff`. Thus we have a cycle dependency and cannot proceed.\n\nIt would be doable, of course, by introducing stubs for functions and later patching those with the actual references. But I'd rather keep everything dead simple if possible. Since modules alone just form a tree they can't introduce cyclic dependencies, so a simple tree traversal would do the trick.\n",
