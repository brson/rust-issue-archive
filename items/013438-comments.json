    "body": "There are a mix of problems/questions that should be addressed here:\n- Does hash/hashmap actually document that the keys _must_ not be mutated, or at least not mutated in any way that is propagated into their computed hash values?  This property was almost built-in to our old setup when hashing was pretty much forced to always be `IterBytes` (excepting corner cases where one did things like make `IterBytes` return random results), but now the ability to plug in other hash functions (admittedly a feature-gated property) changes this.  And of course the ability to mutate the keys as illustrated here also breaks this property.\n- Is this actually exposing a safety violation?  Depending on how hashmap is implemented, it _could_ be, but if the hashmap were not using `unsafe` code, then you wouldn't have any safety violation -- it would just be that the internal variants of the hashmap are violated, and you get answers that you didn't expect, but things remain _safe_.\n- Do we want to bring back the `Freeze` bound since it sounds like it may be useful in some cases (though may also be a stronger constraint than what you actually want/need for the keys in a hashmap, I'm not sure).\n\nWe should resolve the questions above; they may need to be split off into subbugs.\n\nAccepted for 1.0, P-backcompat-lang\n",

    "body": "No, it may not necessarily always be a memory safety issue. But I remember several presentations where it was prominently stated that Rust's rules around references, mutability and aliasing prevented your typical iterator-invalidation bugs and ConcurrentModificationException scenarios. And I always found this to be very good argument for having the things the way they are.\n\nI feel that with `Share` replacing `Freeze`, the meaning of 'immutable' references has changed in a subtle but significant way. Before, when I had a `&T` reference I knew a very important thing: I don't have to care about aliasing issues. `&T` would only allow aliasing in a way where it effectively would not matter. That's a huge deal for a programmer's mental workload when reading code. Granted, with `Cell` and `@mut` this already was not entirely true but `Freeze` would allow me to really safely guard against this problem.\n\nNow, when I have a `&T`, what do I know? That access to the underlying object is synchronized. That's not nothing, admittedly, but aliasing has become an issue again. If I mutate something through some 'immutable' reference, what else will change? What's the role of `&mut` if `&` also allows for mutation. Maybe it would make more sense to have a `&share` reference kind instead of the `Share` trait. Then one could allow for synchronized access to an object without giving up on having the concept of deep immutability at the language level. \n\nWell, this has become kind of a rant now `:)` Maybe it's just a problem I've glossed over so far because I try avoid `Cell` as much as possible. But I look at `trans` in its current form and I'm wondering if `Share` doesn't invite this unfortunate style of `&` being more of a suggestion than a hard guarantee.\n",

    "body": "FWIW, I'm more relaxed about this issue now for a few reasons:\n- @arielb1 is right, as soon as IO is involved, all bets are off and one has to rely on informal promises anyway.\n- If `Share`, as has been proposed somewhere, is renamed to `Threadsafe` or something to that effect, the situation will be less ambiguous.\n\nIt would be nice if something like `Freeze` was expressible even when methods are involved but short of an effect system tracking IO, I don't see a way of doing this. Definitely not something I would expect in Rust 1.0.\n",
