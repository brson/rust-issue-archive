    "body": "I'm working on a b-tree implementation as well. @duckmatt Perhaps we can combine our efforts and work together on the implementation?\n\nMy implementation is nowhere near complete. At the moment, the insert method does split the node when the node is full. However, the node is not properly inserted into its parent node. See `test_insert_split_add_root()` for a test case that currently failed because of this.\n\nI think I chose a proper data structure layout to start with:\n- separate keys from leaf/node pointers to speed up key matching.\n- there are `n` nodes and `n - 1` keys. With key-value pairs (where value is a node- or value pointer), it is not possible to have `n-1` keys. Having `n` keys implies that the key has to be copied, or is set to None. I thought that an extra key in every node would be wasteful, if the data structure layout is also possible with `n-1` keys.\n- trees are owned and there are no copies of keys or values necessary during the insert.\n- stack-allocated, fixed-sized vectors to store the keys and node-/value pointers.\n\nAt the moment, `BTREE_ORDER` is a constant. There was a discussion on IRC about if it was possible to make it a trait parameter, but that's not possible with the current Rust compiler.\n\nComments are more than welcome. I started this b-tree implementation as an exercise to learn Rust, but I think we could turn our efforts into a usable b-tree implementation suitable for the Rust standard library.\n\nSource: https://github.com/smvv/rust-btree/blob/master/btree.rs\nDocs: http://smvv.io/rust-btree/doc/\n\n@duckmatt Btw, my nickname is `smvv` on the Rust IRC channel `#rust`.\n",

    "body": "@smvv Looks good, that's pretty much where I got to so I figure I'll just make contributions to your code from now on and we can try to get that working. \n\nInserting into a parent is where I found the problem to be, because if the parent is full too then you need to split the parent, then insert into the parent of the parent, and so on until you reach the root or a node that's not full. So to implement this it seems like you need to build a list of mutable nodes as you walk down the tree, you'll add to this every time you come across a full node and clear it each time you come across a not full node. Problem is with this approach you then end up with two mutable reference to the same owned box. The alternative is to either use some interesting flow of data with recursion if it's possible, or to do the splits while walking down the tree (which is only possible with an even order, but I see you're asserting for that already anyway, so this may be the way to go)\n",

    "body": "The b-tree successfully inserts 100,000 randomly generated uints, and checks if the key is in the tree at the end. Inserting 100,000 uints followed by 100,000 lookups takes 50 ms on an intel i7 950 at 3.07 GHz. Without the lookups, inserting 100,000 uints takes 40ms. At the moment, removing keys is not implemented, and the b-tree will fail if a duplicated key is inserted (see below). \n\nIt is important to note that the insert() method does not return true / false for a new / old key. The reason is that the top-down algorithm cannot determine if a key does already exist. If a key is stored in a leaf, the top-down algorithm will discover the uniqueness once it's at the leaf node. However, in order to insert something in a leaf, the top-down algorithm has to split full nodes before it is at the leaf.\n\nThe question is whether it is useful to return true for a new key that is not inserted before. If it is important, insertion has to perform a find() prior to the splitting. How about defining two methods: one that performs a find() operation for uniqueness prior to insertion, and one for inserting only unique values?\n\n@thestinger @duckmatt What is your opinion about this?\n\nI chose 20 as minimal degree for the b-tree. It gave a good result for inserting 100,000 and 1,000,000 random uints. I compared it with 40 and 50, but insertion took longer (plus ~10ms for 100,000) for those values. I'm not sure what the optimal value will be.\n\nThis top-down algorithm is used: http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap19.htm\n\nSource: https://github.com/smvv/rust-btree/blob/master/btree.rs\n",

While walking down, you can find the key in a internal node or a leaf. There should be no need for a second find operation. Although, it will cause a split operation on a node when the node is full, and the key exists already in the b-tree. This is not really an issue because the properties of the b-tree still hold.\n\nYour comment gave me another idea: The b-tree uses binary search for finding a leaf, but it does a linear search on the keys in a node. As an experiment, I used binary search on the keys in a node to see if binary search is faster than linear search. The idea behind the experiment is that the run-time increases when the number of keys per node increases. Unfortunately, using binary search on the keys did not reduce the run-time. I tried larger number of keys as well (# of keys I tried is {20, 40, 50}).\n\nYou can find the disabled binary search here: https://github.com/smvv/rust-btree/blob/master/btree.rs#L142\n\nAnd important to note is: Using btree.rs as a library does not work: see #8044.\n",

Nice things about this are:\n- Things that we know are there aren't wrapped in options.\n- The invariant that there's always one more branch than key/value is enforced by the type.\n- Leaves are compact and fast to iterate through.\n- Size of the nodes is tunable in the constructor.\n\nThe main cons I see are:\n- Keys in branches are relatively far apart might be slower to scan.\n- 2 allocations in each branch node.\n- Special case for dealing with the far right child of a branch.\n",

    "body": "@duckmatt You could use a borrowed pointer with a lifetime but then it wouldn't be sendable or you could use some unsafe code.  I think DList uses unsafe pointers for backpointers so it'll be sendable.\n\nI'm not sure what we want is a B+ Tree, though.  I suspect @thestinger was inspired to open this issue by [Google's C++ btree implementation](https://code.google.com/p/cpp-btree/) which is faster than the normal C++ std::map.  Their implementation stores an array of key value pairs in every node.  Other that Google's implementation, I'm not aware of B-Trees being used for in memory data structures so I don't know if there's any data on whether a B+ Tree would be advantageous for this.  If you have any please correct me.  Either way, I think it would be better to start out with something simple, get it working, then try to optimize the representation after we have some tests and benchmarks in place as a baseline.\n",

If the key is not present, the key is stored in its parent. If the direct parent does not have the key, the key is stored in the parent of the parent.\n\nThis is a 2-3-4 b-tree (BTREE_MIN_DEGREE = 2).\n\nIf I understand generics and Rust's enums correctly, a Leaf points directly to its value in the current implementation. There's no pointer between the node's pointer and the actual value. Thus `L(key=0)` contains the value, not a pointer to the value. This means that there's no overhead for leaf nodes (normally b-tree will use a smaller struct for leafs to reduce the memory footprint).\n",

In design it is much closer to @smvv implementation then to the design that is being implemented by niftynif. That is that leaf nodes are the only nodes that hold data, and branch nodes are key and pointer data only. It's much more complete then either, as it implements all of MutableMap and Iterator interface.\n\nhttps://github.com/csherratt/cow-rs/blob/master/src/cow/btree.rs\n\nThere is a few problem areas, mostly around the fixed sized arrays inside of the nodes which in the current state of rust is difficult to avoid (std::mem::sizeof would need to be compile time, not run time evaluable).\n",

    "body": "Well, a B+tree requires next pointers which my implementation lacks. There are some advantages to a real B-tree over what I have done. The largest being that you should not have to clone any of the keys which is a real improvement if the keys are a string or any other allocated data structure.\n\nI'm interested to see how performance would compare. In a b+tree the internal nodes are more compact since they lack data values. This should make it faster to search for trees that do not fit in the L1 cache. On the other hand, having data in the internal nodes means that a b-tree will have many opportunities for early outs. Comparing search performance of my btree to a binary tree like treemap I found that treemap was faster up until the tree size grew to about 1000 keys.\n",
