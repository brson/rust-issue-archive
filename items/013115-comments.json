    "body": "> With that in mind, I'm not too worried about the details leaking\n\nYeah, I was not so keen on that, but I can't see a sensible way around it (since internally squashing errors is barely sensible).\n\n---\n\nI'm also a little concerned that most people will just call `.unwrap()` and get a \"unwrap called on Err\" message rather than anything to do with (a) where it came from (i.e. completely disconnected from librand), or (b) what the error was (i.e. doesn't inspect the `IoError` at all).\n\nThis is a general problem with `IoResult`, but I think librand may suffer from it more than most other libs because many people will just want an RNG, and don't want to think about errors... which means when an error does happen they get far less information than they used to. (That said, `task_rng` is the one that fails most, due to HashMap, and it now has a nicer message; so I don't think this will be too concerning in practice.)\n",
