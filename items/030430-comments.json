ChaCha20-based userland CSPRNG that backs up to an entropy syscall. That sounds like a ton of extra overhead and complexity.\n\nBasically, arc4random is suggested over getentropy because it's a standard library CSPRNG rather than a straight syscall. But Rust implements its own standard library CSPRNG using the primitives we implement in `src/libstd/rand/os.rs`, so that advice doesn't apply to us\n",

I'd like to preserve that convention for now, and it should be pretty easy to add functionality to libc\n",
