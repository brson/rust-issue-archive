    "body": "@dcrewi Yes, Vim can make use of extended information; for example, I tried modifying my `TAGS.vi` to add trait and type information (the contents after the word `f` on the first two lines is what I added):\n\n```\npush_str    /home/chris/vc/rust/src/libstd/str.rs   /^    fn push_str(&mut self, rhs: &str) {$/;\"   f   trait:OwnedStr  type:~str\npush_str    /home/chris/vc/rust/src/libstd/str.rs   /^    fn push_str(&mut self, rhs: &str);$/;\"    f   trait:OwnedStr\npush_str    /home/chris/vc/rust/src/libstd/str.rs   /^pub fn push_str(lhs: &mut ~str, rhs: &str) {$/;\"  f\n```\n\n`:ts push_str` then shows \"trait:OwnedStr type:~str\" as an extra line for the first and \"trait:OwnedStr\" for the second, in the right place.\n\n(Of course, we are here speaking of tags which are inherently fairly dumb; intelligent completion is a completely distinct project of significantly greater difficulty which is covered elsewhere.)\n\nThe ability to specify whether private things should have tags made for them or not would be good, too. (If I'm working on a crate, I want all the tags, but if it's just a dependency of mine I probably only want public tags.)\n",

    "body": "Some thoughts:\n\nThere is no reason to do this as part of rustdoc that I can see, it seems independent. I'd probably like it to be part of `rustc`. I imagine it working roughly like this: you write `--etags=path-to-TAGS-file` or `--ctags=path-to-tags-file` (or something), and it will start to generate a `TAGS` file alongside the binary. If there is already an existing file, it is loaded and parsed: all existing entries that correspond to files that are within the current source directory (the subdirectory containing `lib.rs` or whatever) are removed. New entries are added for the new source files. This way you can concatenate multiple crates together into one file. Bonus points for integrating this into cargo.\n\nCoupling it to `rustc` seems a _bit_ strange but also damn convenient, because you basically want these to always get regenerated whenever you build. Also there is no _stable_ interface to rustc so it seems ok. I guess I'd say that long term it should live wherever the dxr source lives, which is currently rustc.\n\nThe TAGS file should be generated after parsing but before type check, so that you get TAGS files even if compilation errors occur.\n",
