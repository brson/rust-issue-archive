I'd like to see a consistent way for std traits to be `impl`d for std types (even if it involves polite errors), otherwise the Rust ecosystem could get messy quickly with different libs implementing them in different/unpredictable ways. Also, the usage and purpose for `RefCell` is very specific, I think your suggestion would offer more than enough clarity for any client usage. If the client isn't happy, then perhaps `RefCell` isn't the type they're looking for? Anyway, I think this would be a much rarer case than clients wondering why it isn't implemented at all.\n",
