The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @nikomatsakis (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "OK, let's try this again. I've resolved the merge conflict. I've also fixed several doc tests that I overlooked the first time around.\n\nThe doc tests were broken in the original patch because I ended up running `make check` piecemeal to work around issues with Valgrind, and I somehow missed the doctests. I've now figured out how to disable Valgrind, and I've managed to run the doctests as follows:\n\n```\nmake check\n# Fix broken doctests\nmake check-docs NO_REBUILD=1\n```\n\nThe `check-docs` succeeded, but if `check` does anything important after `check-docs`, I haven't run it yet. So I'm running another full `make check` right now, but it's going to take several hours.\n\nAnyway, thank you for helping a newbie figure out how to produce a competent Rust patch! \n",

I've already run all the per-crate tests and the doc tests several times, plus the runpass, etc. So this patch should be basically good.\n\nFor the future, I'll keep trying to run a full `make check` on my system. Right now, it's failing in DWARF debugsym tests that call into gdb. I probably need a new gdb version of something.\n",
