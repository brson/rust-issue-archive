    "body": "Yeah, I was talking with @sfackler about this at the meetup. Right now I have a `lua_extern!()` macro that takes something that looks like a function declaration (with severe limitations, due to `macro_rules!()`). I asked about `ItemDecorator`, because I thought it would be much nicer if I could say `#[lua_extern] fn foo() { ... }` and have it do the appropriate transformation. But this would require the ability to modify (or more accurately, replace) the original item.\n\nI also thought that this ability would allow `#[cfg()]` to be (re-)implemented using this same standard mechanism, instead of whatever mechanism it uses now, since all that really needs is the ability to remove the decorated item.\n",
