    "body": "I have an almost working version of this and am working on a PR. Some caveats I've discovered:\n- It will only work in non-Android POSIX as it depends on libgcc _and_ libbacktrace.\n- We really need `_Unwind_GetIPInfo` instead of `_Unwind_GetIP` to determine if given IP is a non-signaling frame (thus the IP is located _after_ the calling instruction). GCC 4.2.0 or later has this, so it should be fine, but we need a workaround for non-libgcc paths.\n- `backtrace_pcinfo` can be called multiple times for inlined calls. For the convenience I have 32 calls limit right now.\n- Macros somehow replaces the file/line information for given frame, which makes a test quite annoying. `panic!()` for example will replace the last user frame with `<std macros>:3` instead of a line invoking the macro. Really an issue at its own.\n",
