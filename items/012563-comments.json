    "body": "Ok, I removed the last commit about specialising hasher.\n\nRegarding the slight performance issue, the vector element in question is a tuple `(Ident, Name)`, 12 bytes in memory. The new `vec_ng` always doubles the vector size if running out of capacity, while `vec` only increases it modestly by 1. In the hygiene `let` smoke test, there is 5000 elements in the renaming list at the peak. So `vec_ng` has 8192 capacity or `8192 * 12 = 96k`, `vec` on the other hand only uses `roundup(5000 * 12) = 64k`, it could be that `vec` is more CPU L1/L2 cache friendly in this case.\n\nIn any case, the performance difference is not that significant.\n",
