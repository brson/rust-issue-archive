    "body": "Hm ok reader the uv code, it looks like exec errors are reported in the callback (which is a little unfortunate). I also think that the current handling of the error codes is pretty wrong, and I think that the callback should get modified slightly.\n\nI think that the uv `ExitCallback` should take a `ProcessExit` and a watcher explicitly, and the conversion should look like:\n\n``` rust\nmatch term_signal {\n  0 => match exit_status {\n    n if n < 0 => ExitExecError(UvError(n)),\n    n => ExitStatus(n),\n  },\n  n => ExitSignal(n),\n}\n```\n\nI'm not entirely certain if you can have a clean negative exit status, but I that this will correctly propagate the uv error. Note that `ExitExecError` is an explicit `UvError` (or maybe it's an `IoError`), not an integer (because this error is based off errno). Also, I think that we should have a test for something like executing a non-existent program and make sure that this gets reported as the correct `ExitExecError`. Right now I think that it's a nonzero exit status which is not correct.\n",

    "body": "Updated with input from review and rebased onto current master with the libuv crate move. No local regressions with a `make check`.\n\nStill not totally sure on the `UvError` semantics that should be used (not currently certain how to pull in `UvError` from librustuv to libstd). My preference would be to expose the `errorno` field on the libuv process type to Rust. We could then use that field as the first thing to match on, as if that is non-zero we have hit an error of some description in executing the task. However that also seems to be delving a bit deeper into the internals of libuv and its data types than may be wise.\n\nI am also uncertain about the updated code to handle problems running `cc` and friends in `link.rs` (and the rustpkg calls of the same type). The main thing is what will happen there if the user overrides the program to use (if possible?) and overrides it to something that does not exist?\n\n@huonw - RE the test that invokes itself. Sure, I can look into doing that. Is there any advantage to doing it that way over the current test, which sends itself a SIGHUP via bash?\n",

The unfortunate part of the latter is that this enum becomes move-by-default because of the contained `Option<~str>`. I don't think that this will cause problems, but you might end up turning up something (hopefully not!).\n\nAlso, were you able to figure out what happened if you spawned a process of a nonexistent program? I would expect that to return an `ExitExecError`, and if so we should have a test for that.\n",
