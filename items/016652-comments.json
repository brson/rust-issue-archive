    "body": "AIUI, this kind of usage requires [higher-rank lifetimes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15067), once we get that, `doit` would have this signature: `fn doit<T, F: <'a>|: &'a mut int| -> T>(f: F)`, and your first attempt will work.\n\nIf you (desperately) need this code to work _right now_, you can throw a `mem::transmute` around the `&mut x` in your second attempt. But that's very hacky [1], so I recommend waiting for higher-rank lifetimes.\n\n[1] Because `'a` shouldn't appear in the generic parameter list of the `doit` function.\n",
