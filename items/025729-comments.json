    "body": "Thanks for the report! This sort of change is definitely planned, however, and has yet to be implemented. The switch from returning just a plain `char` to returning an iterator of characters reflects this. A minor update such as this will not be considered a breaking change, especially because of the way the documentation is currently worded. As a result I'm going to close this issue for now in favor of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25800, which reflects the current plan.\n",
