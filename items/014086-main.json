  "body": "Provides better help for the resolve failures inside an `impl` if the name matches:\n- a field on the self type\n- a method on the self type\n- a method on the current trait ref (in a trait impl)\n\nNot handling trait method suggestions if in a regular `impl` (as you can see on line 69 of the test), I believe it is possible though.\n\nAlso, provides a better message when `self` fails to resolve due to being a static method.\n\nIt's using some unsafe pointers to skip copying the larger structures (which are only used in error conditions); it's likely possible to get it working with lifetimes (all the useful refs should outlive the visitor calls) but I haven't really figured that out for this case. (can switch to copying code if wanted)\n\nCloses #2356.\n",
