    "body": "I'm getting something very similar. I can't really reduce the test case though, because it seems totally arbitrary what does and doesn't trigger it, and commenting out too much stuff \"fixes\" it. I'm _also_ doing stuff that uses gl-rs and glfw-rs... I get a very similar traceback, inside lookup_constness and everything. The actual traceback points to a failure in a line that looks like \n\n``` rust\nelse if window.get_key(glfw::KeyW) == glfw::Press\n```\n\nSpecifically the `glfw::KeyW`. The weird thing is, normally this line gives the compiler no problems, and commenting out random things can make it compile fine. But what I _did_ find is that it seems to be triggered at least in part by the presence of `static` declarations in my module. I don't cast the statics like in #9942, but removing the statics (and replacing their uses with the values they're defined as) makes the problem disappear.\n\n**Edit:** I may as well throw the code up: https://gist.github.com/JarrettBillingsley/7983334 it's one of the lines on 601, 603, or 605 that it barfs on, I can't really tell (my libsyntax wasn't built with debug info).\n",
