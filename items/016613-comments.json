    "body": "So the most obvious fix to me for these specific concerns is to have:\n\n```\nfn to_int(&self) -> Option<int> { \n    if self.is_finite() {\n        Some(*self as int) \n    } else {\n        None\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBut this raises some intent ambiguities for me. Is this API intended to provide a generic interface for casting, or meant to provide a more finicky alternative, for when you really care if the cast is sane (similar to providing checked versions of the math operators)? Right now we snap to the \"nearest\" valid value. So for instance `-300` maps to `0` on a uint. Do we want to yield `None` if the float is out of the valid upper/lower bound of the integral primitive? What if the value is like, `3.4`? Are we happy with rounding, or do we want to yield `None` there, to?\n",

    "body": "Well to me at least, when a function returns an `Option` then that means that: \"if no suitable value can be returned, then return None\". So it seems strange to change this pattern for these methods. \n\nFurthermore I think it is just as sane to have `.to_int()` and `.to_uint()` refer to the - as you said - more finicky way of casting, and then if all you want is a straight cast you use exactly that (thereby also showing what you mean to do). That would also make it easier to check if the conversion happened succesfully, without having to check all the edge cases beforehand (unless there is some other way to acheive this, which I don't know about).\n\nBut I see your point in that where to draw the line between valid and invalid input is not all that obvious. However if the current implementation sticks around, I would still love it if a short notice was added to the docs.\n\nFWIW though I would be fine with your current implementation for `.to_int()`. I am just as unsure about what to do with `.to_uint()` as you are right now, though.\n",
