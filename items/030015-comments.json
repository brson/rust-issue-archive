They are pretty easy to forget as https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/29083 showed.\n\nA compromise variant - staged-ness is determined by stable/unstable in the crate root, crate root annotations are required when `#[feature(staged_api)]` is enabled, i.e. if you want to annotate anything in the crate, then you are gently asked to annotate the crate root as well. This doesn't give `#[feature(staged_api)]` _too_ much power I guess. @eefriedman what do you think?\n",
