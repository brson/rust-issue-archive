Therefore, the only purpose of `next()` AFAICT is to make implementing Searcher easier -- you only need to implement one function instead of two. But that benefit isn't born out in practice. StrSearcher implements two methods anyway, and it would be simpler to implement `next_reject()` instead of `next()`. CharEqSearcher implements `next()` only, but it would be simpler and cleaner to optimize if it implemented `next_match()` and `next_reject()` instead.\n",

    "body": "I wrote the impl for `Regex` a while back, which does indeed only implement `next`: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/blob/master/src/re.rs#L1104 I seem to recall that it was tricky to get the corner cases right, but that isn't too surprising. I otherwise found it pretty straight forward.\n\nOne thing that I don't think is representable with the `Pattern` API is fast retrieval of all matches [from a suffix table](http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/suffix/struct.SuffixTable.html#method.positions). In particular, matches are reported as part of lexicographically sorted suffixes rather than order of occurrence in the string, so it can't satisfy the contract of `Searcher` without an additional cost. (I've already talked to @Kimundi about this, and I don't think it's a major issue. Suffix tables are a pretty niche data structure.)\n",

    "body": "Today I investigated a bit what would need to be done to generalize the Pattern API to arbitrary slice types. As part of that I also took a more pragmatic route to the involved types and interfaces based on these assumptions:\n- Generally, the API should suit the std library, with more complex scenarios being handled by external libraries.\n- Thus, providing the same feature set for libstd slice types like str, [T] or OsStr is more important than having a API that can accommodate the most general kind of \"slice type\".\n- Having an more simple to maintain API suitable for the existing consumers like find, split and match_indices is a higher priority than having a more complicated API that could accommodate exotic consumers.\n- Being able to reuse the API for mutable slices is worth a moderate increase in API verbosity and unsafety-based interface surfaces.\n\nA very rough sketch of the result can be seen below. Note that this is only the Pattern traits itself, without actual integration in the std lib or comprehensive re implementation of the existing types.\n\nhttps://github.com/Kimundi/pattern_api_sketch/blob/master/src/v5.rs\n\nThe core changes are:\n- The `Pattern` trait now has an input parameter for the slice type. This turns `Pattern<'a>` into `Pattern<&'a str>` and allows for `Pattern<&'a mut [T]>`.\n- `next()` got removed, leaving only `next_{match/reject}()`. This has been done because none of the existing types could make use of the return value of `next()`, and none of the existing implementations benefited from needing to implement it.\n  - As part of that change, the `Pattern::is_{prefix/suffix}_of()` methods are no longer default-implemented. But seeing how the manual implementation for a given pattern-slice combination is usually simple and straight forward, this does not appear to be a problem.\n- In order to allow for mutable slices and shared code of general iterators like `match_indices` between slice types,\n  the return values of `next_*()` are now associated types of the slice type.\n  They have an API that allows them to be used as abstract raw pointer types, which means generic code can use them relatively freely to create slices at or between matches, at the cost of requiring unsafe code and needing to follow aliasing rules.\n\n---\n\nChanges in regard to the open questions:\n- In addition to the existing interface, the new `SearchPtrs` trait has gained new ad-hoc named elements which would require additional name audition. Also, `Pattern` continues to be a confusing name in a language with pattern matching...\n- The sketched API change is somewhat more conservative by getting rid of the `next()` methods,\n  concentrating instead on the pure search loops.\n- The prior point should also make the performance aspect more validateable.\n  However, should the existing slice type-specific iterators types like `split()` be replaced by shared, generic ones there might be some regressions due to optimizations possibly not carrying over. This is optional though.\n- We should probably specify the Pattern API more closely as only being intended for iterator-like linear search operations.\n",

    "body": "I'm currently trying out some runtime scanners for [`scan-rules`](https://crates.io/crates/scan-rules).  Basically: I want users to be able to parse text based on `Pattern`s (_e.g._ accept anything that matches this pattern, consume input until this pattern is matched, _etc._).  The current example is being able to do something like (where `until` accepts a `Pattern`):\n\n``` rust\nlet_scan!(\"before:after\", (let word_0 <| until(\":\"), \":\", let word_1: Everything));\nassert_eq!(word_0, \"before\");\nassert_eq!(word_1, \"after\");\n```\n\nThe problem I'm having is that it's _really_ painful to actually do this.  The interface as it exists seems to assume that ownership of the pattern can be passed to the method which will use it, and as a result, can _only_ be used _exactly once_.  This doesn't make much sense to me.  Searching for a pattern should not (in general) _consume_ the pattern.\n\nWhat I want is `P: Pattern` \u21d2 `for<P: Pattern> &P: Pattern`.  Currently, it's only true for `&str`.  If I had this, I could take ownership of the pattern from the caller, store it, and loan it to the underlying `find` calls.  If the caller wants to use the pattern in multiple places, and it's expensive to construct, they can instead pass my function a borrow, which will also work.\n\nThe more I think about this, the more it comes down to the `FnMut` implementation.  The only closure kind that would allow for the kind of interface I want is `Fn`... but that excludes closures that test based on accumulated state, though I wonder how often that's even desireable.\n\nI can work around this by requiring `Copy` patterns, but again, callables are _the_ most useful kind of pattern (`until(char::is_whitespace)`, _etc._), so it seems a deep shame to exclude them.\n",

They are probably more useful than enums in this case since the accepting function can distinguish newtypes at the type level and newtypes are more easily extendable, as the different cases of patterns don't seem to be super well enumerated. Maybe implementing some reasonably common ones like `Or` (one or the other), `ExactOrder` (one after the other, no gaps), and `InOrder` (one after the other, gaps), so users don't have to get their hands into `unsafe` `Searcher` would be good. Then adding some examples to `Pattern` to make them more discoverable.\r\n\r\nThis would let us have default implementations for types like `&[char]` while also getting rid of concerns about working in several different ways, since we can just disambiguate with the newtypes. It also opens up nesting, which could be useful. (Though I'll mention that we seem to be slowly approaching regex.)",

    "body": "I'm a little confused by the API; the API docs for [`std::str::pattern::Searcher`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/pattern/trait.Searcher.html) state that:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nThis trait provides methods for searching for non-overlapping matches of a pattern starting from the front (left) of a string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see the following possible interpretations of this, and I want to be sure which is in use to prevent any ambiguity in implementations.\r\n\r\n### Greedy approach\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for the string `aa` in the haystack `aaaaa`, then you'll always get a sequence like the following if you require a greedy search:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nMatch(0,2)\r\nMatch(2,4)\r\nReject(4,5)\r\nDone\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Starts at the start of the string, but skips some letters because why not?\r\n\r\nGreedy is overrated.  Let's skip the first letter and match on the rest!\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nReject(0,1)\r\nMatch(1,3)\r\nMatch(3,5)\r\nDone\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Getting the most matches is so overrated, how about we skip some?\r\n\r\nThe API definition doesn't require that the maximal number of matches be returned, so we could just ignore some matching sub-strings.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nReject(0,1)\r\nReject(1,2)\r\nMatch(2,4)\r\nReject(4,5)\r\nDone\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Suggestions for documentation improvements.\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest that matching is always greedy and always maximal.  Roughly the following pseudo-code (don't use this in production, it will overflow your stack, and finite state machines are faster anyways):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// `results` is empty when this function is first called.\r\n// `usize` is 0 when first called.\r\nfn string_matcher(pattern: &str, haystack: &str, results: &mut Vec<SearchStep>, index: usize) {\r\n    if haystack.len() < pattern.len() {\r\n        if haystack.len() > 0 {\r\n            results.push(SearchStep::Reject(index, index + haystack.len()));\r\n        }\r\n        results.push(SearchStep::Done);\r\n    } else if pattern == &haystack[0..pattern.len()] {\r\n        results.push(SearchStep::Match(index, index + pattern.len()));\r\n        string_matcher(\r\n            pattern,\r\n            &haystack[pattern.len()..],\r\n            results,\r\n            index + pattern.len(),\r\n        );\r\n    } else {\r\n        results.push(SearchStep::Reject(index, index + 1));\r\n        string_matcher(pattern, &haystack[1..], results, index + 1);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=80d315f4a21b0cb2566b57c6c344abc1)",

    "body": "The best example I can give you off the top of my head is *very* niche, and likely not applicable to `str`.  \r\n\r\nI sometimes have to decode streams of bytes coming in from a receiver that can make errors[^1] because of clock skew, mismatched oscillator frequencies, and noise in general.  These can show up as bit flips, missing bits, or extra bits.  Despite this, I want to know when a legitimate byte stream is starting.  The normal (and fast) way is to define some kind of known pattern that signals that a frame is starting, which I'm going to call the start of frame pattern[^2].  To make your own life simple, this pattern is going to be chosen to be highly unlikely to occur by accident in your environment, but it's also really, really easy to look for.  One example might be just to have a stream of bits like `0101010101` as your start pattern.  \r\n\r\nNow here is where things get interesting; while you could use some form of [forward error correction (FEC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code#Forward_error_correction) code to encode the start of frame pattern, continuously decoding all incoming bits to look for the pattern is energy intensive, which means battery life goes down.  What you want to do is find the probable start of a frame, and then start the computationally (and therefore power) expensive process of decoding bits only when you are pretty sure you've found the start of a frame.  So, you don't bother with proper FEC of the frame pattern.  Instead, you make your pattern simple, and your pattern matcher will be just as simple.  If it sees a pattern that looks like it could be a start of frame, you turn on your full FEC decoder and start decoding bits until you either decide that you made a mistake, or you have a frame (checksums, etc. come later).\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the noise I mentioned earlier can show up anywhere, including at the head of the start of frame pattern.  So instead of looking for the full `0101010101` start of frame pattern, you might just look for `0101` in overlapping substrings, starting a new FEC decode task as soon as you match the pattern[^3].  Which is where you need the overlapping pattern search.\r\n\r\nAll of that makes good sense in a byte stream, and that is where the [`windows`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.windows) method can be helpful.  Does any of this make sense for a UTF-8 encoded string that is not subject to errors in encoding?  Probably not.  But, this is the best I could come up with on the spur of the moment for a practical use case. \r\n\r\n[^1]: 'Receiver' in this case might be hardware, like a radio receiver.  If the receiver is in a noisy environment, then it's constantly receiving bits, including bits that are just noise.\r\n\r\n[^2]: I'm skipping so many details and algorithms that can be used under various conditions, it isn't even funny.  If you know that background, just fill in the details in your head, if you don't know them, just ignore them.  I'm just trying to give a very simplified example here.\r\n\r\n[^3]: The assumption is that since the noise could be anywhere including in the start of frame section, you might have to start correcting for errors that occurred right at the start of your actual byte string.",

    "body": "@Fishrock123 It is doable, but substring search algorithms are usually not amenable to being adapted straight-forwardly to support case insensitivity. (This isn't true for all of them, but I think is likely true for Two-Way at least, which is the algorithm currently used for substring search.) So in order to support such a flag, you'd probably need to dispatch to an entirely different algorithm.\r\n\r\nAnother option is the `regex` crate. It's a bit of a beefy dependency for just a simple ASCII case insensitive search, but it will do it for you. The [`aho-corasick` crate also supports ASCII case insensitivity](https://docs.rs/aho-corasick/latest/aho_corasick/struct.AhoCorasickBuilder.html#method.ascii_case_insensitive). While Aho-Corasick is typically used for multi-substring search, it can of course be used with just one substring. `aho-corasick` is a less beefy dependency than `regex`.",

    "body": "I think the summary here is that this API needs rework and somebody to champion it. There was some good discussion at #71780, including a rough proposal from @withoutboats in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71780#issuecomment-688250368. This kinda sorta echos @Luro02's outline in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27721#issuecomment-828271222 (it seems like GATs provide us with a more ergonomic solution in any case)\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that slice patterns were removed (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76901#issuecomment-880169952) but we may want some way to work with `&[u8]` byte strings. It is a bit of a pain point that many std APIs require a UTF-8 `&str` when it isn't always needed, meaning that there is a runtime cost for `str::from_utf8` to do things without `unsafe` when you have mostly-but-maybe-not-completely UTF-8 sequences (e.g., `OsStr` / `Read` interaction)\r\n\r\nSo the next steps forward, probably:\r\n1. Somebody puts forth a design proposal. I don't think this needs to be a RFC since the concept was already accepted, but it has been so long that I think we just need a from-scratch design with justification and documented limitations. An ACP is probably a good place for this (acps are just an issue template at https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team, link it here if you post one)\r\n2. Implement that proposal\r\n3. Revisit stabilization after it has been around for a while\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that we more or less have to go back to square one with stabilization, but there have been a lot of lessons learned and better ways to do things since the 2014 RFC (a decade!). Really this is probably just in need of somebody to take charge of the redesign and push everything forward.",

    "body": "I realize there are a lot of issues with stabilizing the `pattern` feature itself, but if I may suggest a possible middle ground, would it be possible to work on detecting particular pattern search patterns and try to just optimize (a subset of) those (possibly via some specific hint, perhaps only using iter instead of in a for loop) to internally use some version of `TwoWaySearcher` (or anything, really)?\r\n\r\nThere are no guarantees for compiler optimizations, there's no specific api we would have to stabilize, and we don't need to handle all the cases (not all at once nor even eventually), but it could give a decent performance boost to certain code and be both an asset in the short-term (until a stable pattern matching api becomes available) as well as in the long term (code not using the pattern matching api could still benefit).\r\n\r\nNot sure how *doable* this is in the technical sense, but at least on paper it might be worth considering?",
