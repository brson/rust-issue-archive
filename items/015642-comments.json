It's way easier for me to find methods visually, although I guess I could use Ctrl+F, but I don't always know the exact name.\n\nI looked into how one would implement this, and I got it working locally just by implementing `Ord` on `clean::Item` and then sorting the items list before looping through it. The only downside I saw was that it's nice having \"constructor\" methods at the top and sorting methods means they're usually not at the top, but we could probably identify those as all methods that don't take `self` as an argument and return `Self`. \n",
