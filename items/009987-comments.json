IEEE 754 was not ubiquitous when they were designed.\n\nFrom the POSIX standard\n\n>  Finite values of x < -0, a domain error shall occur, and either a NaN (if supported), or an implementation-defined value shall be returned.\n\nBut since we can assume IEEE 754 in the standard library (there are no other floating-point standards that are popular anymore) I think we should just return NaN.\n\nFrom IEEE 754-2008\n\n> 7.2 Invalid operation 7.2.0\n> \u2026, the default result of an operation that signals the invalid operation exception shall be a quiet NaN that should provide some diagnostic information (see 6.2). These operations are:\n> \u2026\n> g) squareRoot if the operand is less than zero\n\nI believe that the POSIX workaround will be surprising to others, since we have an in-band signalling mechanism that is standardized.
