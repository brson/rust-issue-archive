    "body": "We seriously need this in some form by 1.0. I absolutely love Rust but the error messages it vomits are completely nasty and I always find myself having to copy them into vim to manually line them up, which is _very_ frustrating when I know that it can do this work itself, like GHC does with Haskell type errors. I can't imagine how much more frustrating it would be to a newcomer. This issue is compounded given the current type landscape where parameterized types explode in length (e.g. the various kinds of iterators).\n\nThe primary target for compiler output should be humans. We shouldn't be bending over backwards to appease editors; we can create functionality on the side for them if need be, similar to git's porcelain flags:\n\n> Give the output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. This is similar to the short output, but will remain stable across git versions and regardless of user configuration.\n",

Removed a few tests I modified when the originals worked (I probably modified them originally but then they didn't need multi-line treatment and I never backed them out).\n\nI don't think there's a way to turn off the multi-line error checking thing. It's either every line or none. It depends though, it seems to ignore `Note` type. Maybe warnings too. You have to be very explicit now.\n\nIt's still only substring matches though so you don't need the entire message. I just copied them from the terminal though generally so they're pretty exact.\n",
