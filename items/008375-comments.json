    "body": "@thestinger I feel like the idea was that when adapting an iterator in a fashion that would raise the upper bound (e.g. `chain()`), the upper bound would be saturated at `uint::max_value`. And because of that, anything that reduces the upper bound would treat `uint::max_value` specially as that may be an indication of saturation rather than an exact bound.\n\nIn any case, since you don't think this is the approach we should take, then we may have to fix the iterators that increase the upper bound to detect overflow and flip to `None` instead of merely saturating. This needs the `.checked_add()` that @huonw was talking about in IRC yesterday (which we can implement trivially for primitive integral types the same way `saturating_add()` is implemented; in fact I was originally considering making `.saturating_add()` return `(Self, bool)` but decided not to in order to make it simpler to use).\n",
