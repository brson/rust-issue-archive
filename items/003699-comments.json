    "body": "I'm going to vote for this to be a 0.4 blocker since it's breaking cargos like `rust-mongrel2`.\n\nCargo is violating an assumption in the parser that there's only one parser made per task. `syntax::parse::new_parse_sess` calls `syntax::parse::token::mk_ident_interner`, which caches an interner in TLS on the first call, or assert if an interner has already been created. Unfortunately cargo creates a new parser session per crate, which triggers the assertion.\n\nI _think_ this won't be too hard to work around. We could just get rid of the assertion, and share the interner across all parsers in the same thread. I'll prep a patch for this. I'm not sure if this will violate other assumptions in the compiler though.\n\nThe other option would be to hack up cargo to run `cargo::load_crate` in a new thread. This will require some jury rigging, but it'll keep us from having to tweak the parser this close to release.\n",
