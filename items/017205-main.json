  "body": "The prefix was added for all operating systems to avoid issues on OS X\nand Windows. However, it does work properly on Linux with the defaults.\n\nThis will make it possible to use the jemalloc provided by distributions\nafter the next release with `sdallocx`. 8c057984 can then be reverted\nonce Travis has a recent enough jemalloc available.\n\nAvoiding the prefix allows jemalloc to override the weak symbols from\nlibc and the malloc hooks. This eliminates the external fragmentation\ncaused by having two general purpose allocators in the same process.\n\nThe time spent on LLVM passes in the Rust compiler is cut by 10-15%, and\npeak memory usage is reduced by 8-20%.\n\nIn the future, this can be extended to other operating systems but it\nwill require lots of testing, and may involve carefully ordering the\nlibraries the linker is asked to include so that jemalloc is included\nbefore the C standard library.\n\nCloses #14117\n",
