We may tweak the interface, and/or add a richer aio one (either in core or std), but that's true of any module we're considering.\n\nI think at least simple, stdio-style synchronous IO is fair by the third (and possibly second) criteria for libcore. Just about every nontrivial program does IO. It's part of the interface exposed by even the narrowest posix-y narrowings of libc's surface, and we even expose bits through our runtime. I think it's appropriate.\n",
