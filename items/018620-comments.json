Saying \"I have done this in the past\" actually makes it sound as though it's a rare thing to do still.\n\nIn my mind it's analogous to having default immutability for a variable vs the times when you need to explicitly declare it as mutable.\n\nI'm struggling to understand the actual problem with assuming the lifetime in the example given. Is there some way that things would become unsafe that the compiler wouldn't catch?\n\nThis actually started from the IRC channel when I posed the question and [got this](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust/2014-11-04/?msg=24823494&page=24):\n\n```\nhichaelmart Hi all, a question about lifetime specifiers \u2013 can someone explain why the compiler doesn't just automatically create these in the simple cases? ie: fn my_fn<T>(items: T) -> String where T: Iterator<&str>\neddyb hichaelmart: long standing issue\neddyb it's something that should be done IMO\n```\n\nSo I'm not alone in thinking this is something that should be done.\n\nCan someone talk through the problems that would occur (that the compiler wouldn't catch) if it were to assume the lifetimes in the example I gave?\n\nI just worry that simple things like this will turn off newcomers \u2013 and if they can be fixed, then it will really help the adoption of the language.\n",
