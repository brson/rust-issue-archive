  "body": "This PR adds the LLDB autotests to the debuginfo test suite so I don't have to keep rebasing them locally. They are still disabled by default in `tests.mk`. One of the commits also contains a Python pretty printer which can make LLDB print values with Rust syntax. This was mainly added to deal with output format differences between LLDB versions but you can also use it for your normal LLDB debugging sessions.\n\n```\n// The following LLDB commands will load and activate the Rust printers\ncommand script import ./src/etc/lldb_rust_formatters.py\ntype summary add --no-value --python-function lldb_rust_formatters.print_val -x .* --category Rust\ntype category enable Rust\n```\n\nExpect some rough edges with these, they have not been tested apart from there use in the autotests...\n",
