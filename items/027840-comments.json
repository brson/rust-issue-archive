Add a new Rvalue that produces a `(result, overflow)` tuple then unpack it and generate a conditional panic.\n4. Add a special \"Overflow\" operand that is implicitly set by the arithmetic operators and use it to generate a conditional panic. It can default to `false`.\n\nI don't mind 3) as it means we can separate out the overflowing and non-overflowing cases. This is good if want to be able to turn it on and off \"arbitrarily\".

I hope the resulting MIR won't waste a lot of memory.\n\n@doener Was it you who found that optimization difference between MIR and old trans, where old trans would promote a `None` or some such?\nCan you remember the precise details?
