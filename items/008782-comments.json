    "body": "Updated on 8/29:\n\nI re-ran all my tests on the named revisions above, and also against current master. I'm not sure why, but current master is much slower than before.\n\nI put all my code into my github repository in the \"performance-regression\" branch of https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-working. Due to recent changes in master, the original code no longer compiles on master, so, I've updated the code a tiny little bit from before. The tests for test.rc were run as:\n\n../path/to/rustc --opt-level 3 --test test.rc >/dev/null 2>&1 && ./test --bench x8\n\nand the tests for aesbench2.rs were run as:\n\n../path/to/rustc --opt-level 3 --test aesbench2.rs >/dev/null 2>&1 && ./aesbench2 --bench x8\n\nSame as before, test.rc and aesbench2.rs contain pretty much identical code, except that the code in test.rc is split across multiple files and with aesbench2.rs everything is in a single file.\n\nFrom run to run, test results would vary by up to around 0.5 MB/s, so, I wouldn't read too much in to tiny variations. I just tried to report the value that was pretty much the average. If anyone tries to run the benchmarks, I have them setup to report 100x the MB/s value, so, they will report something like 8000 MB/s which is really 80.00 MB/s.\n\n| commit | test.rc (MB/s) | aesbench2.rs (MB/s) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| c178b52fe594c6724d0cf9124665de7e627899a9 (last fast revision) | 84.0 | 83.4 |\n| 0479d946c83cf9ed90bba5b33820ea4118dd8f9e (first slower revision) | 79.8 | 83.4 |\n| 5ef8cdb8fd1f34fd3ab51ceba7ec286cedc349d8 (current master) | 63.5 | 63.8 |\n",
