    "body": "My current thinking is that:\n- `Cell` should go away;\n- This API should be renamed to `BorrowableCell`;\n- There should be a new API `Cell` which is like this API but (a) doesn't have the borrow flags and (b) doesn't allow borrowing (only `get` which copies out and `set` which sets the value). The reasoning here is that if you just have a scalar field like `int`, or even a small-ish field like `Rect<int>`, there's no need to support borrowing; you might as well just avoid wasting space on borrow flags and copy out the values every time. Furthermore, copying out values and setting a new values is an infallible operation that will never fail unless borrowing is allowed, so using this hypothetical future `Cell` instead of `BorrowableCell` when possible will lead to fewer dynamic borrow check failures. Finally, this `Cell` would be simpler for beginners to use.\n",

    "body": "After some discussion on IRC, we decided that while @pcwalton's scheme of using a \"tag-less\" `Cell` is appealing, it doesn't _quite_ work as specified, since there is the possibility that when you call `get()`, which in turn invokes `clone()`. The call to `clone()` invokes user-supplied code which could then call `set()`, overwriting the value being cloned.\n\nThere are some ways to overcome this: one option that appeals to me is to define a \"POD\" builtin bound, basically meaning any type that can be safely memcopied, and then say that `Cell` does not invoke clone but rather just memcopies. Of course this is essentially just reintroducing implicitly copyable as a thing.\n\nPresuming we do wind up with two types, then `RefCell` is a better name than `BorrowableCell`.\n",
