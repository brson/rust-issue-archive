We've been discussing this exact issue for a while over at https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rustdoc-restructuredtext-vs-markdown/356.\n\nRegardless, a change of this magnitude would certainly need an RFC today. We have hundreds and hundreds of pages of documentation in markdown, and moving to something else would really need to justify that effort. As such, the Rust issue tracker isn't the place to have this discussion, please check out that internals thread and possibly work on an RFC, taking into account all of the things over there.
