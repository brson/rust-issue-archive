Unfortunately, the argument about the function not wanting to modify its arguments is not actually true for `getopt`, and in particular GNU libc **violates the prototype of `getopt`** by permuting the array despite the array being declared `const`. PR #25642 is a followup to this one which tries to deal with that. :disappointed:\n",

I think it's fine to make these changes in terms of an API backwards-compatible sense because `*mut` will coerce to `*const`, and your rationale makes sense to me in terms of what signatures these should indeed have. \n\nI wonder, perhaps, though if `getopt` would make more sense to just always take `*mut` to make it easier to pass arguments to?\n",

(And there's this curious text in POSIX and echoed in Linux's man page: \"The parameters argc and argv are the argument count and argument array as passed to _main_()\" -- that is, it might not even be valid to build your own argv out of `std::env::args_os()`.)
