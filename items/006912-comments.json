    "body": "@cmr Sure, what I really want is some documented facility for inspecting a compiled crate: disassembling it and displaying its meta-data.\n\nI want to be able to dissect a compiled library as a way to understand the code `rustc` is generating, and in my experience, a good disassembler will include not only the decoded instruction stream, but also render structures (stored in a constant pool or similar meta-data) referenced by embedded addresses in the instruction stream.\n\nThe standard `objdump` and debug-info inspection facilities may get us part of the way to this goal, but I have been assuming that it would be better for us to provide our own tools for inspecting the meta-data we generate, rather than coupling our meta-data format [to some tool we do not maintain/control].\n\nI phrased my request in terms of an addition to `rust` because when I inspected the output from `rust`'s help message, it appears to provide access to all of the other installed tools:\n- `rustc` : `rust build`,\n- `rustdoc` : `rust doc`,\n- `rusti` : `rust sketch`, and\n- `rustpkg` : `rust pkg`,\n\nso I was assuming that any tool we provide would also be accessible via `rust`.\n",
