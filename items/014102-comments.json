The compiler has no idea what the length is (it could be `0`, it could be `5318008`). Also, by virtue of being a reference, it's not an owned value but is instead borrowing some other owned value.\n\nAn array will implicitly coerce into a slice as necessary (e.g. because you're passing it to a method that requires a slice).\n",

    "body": "There's still code in the tutorial that uses `~[T]`. That's why I was saying that perhaps that change shouldn't be done as part of this PR, because you've now left it in a somewhat inconsistent state.\n\nMy suggestion is to drop the `print_all` change and just stick with the wording change. We can revisit the `~[T]` -> `Vec<T>` change later.\n",
