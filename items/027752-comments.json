    "body": "For a CBOR serializer crate I used the `f32::ldexp` method, I hope to push this discussion forward so my crate will eventually work on stable in the future :grin: \n\nThe unstable methods of `f64` are:\n- `fn integer_decode(self) -> (u64, i16, i8)`\n- `fn ldexp(x: f64, exp: isize) -> f64`\n- `fn frexp(self) -> (f64, isize)`\n- `fn next_after(self, other: f64) -> f64`\n\nThe unstable methods of `f32` are:\n- `fn integer_decode(self) -> (u64, i16, i8)`\n- ~~`fn to_degrees(self) -> f32`~~\n- ~~`fn to_radians(self) -> f32`~~\n- `fn ldexp(x: f32, exp: isize) -> f32`\n- `fn frexp(self) -> (f32, isize)`\n- `fn next_after(self, other: f32) -> f32`\n\nI wonder why `to_degrees()` and `to_radians()` are stable for `f64` but not for `f32` since both implement the same trigonometric functions so they are equally usefull on both types.\n\nThe `ldexp` function should use `i32` instead of `isize` since it does not deal with memory locations. In C ldexp is defined as `double ldexp (double x, int exp);` so it also uses only four bytes. Since it carries the exponent the value will always be much smaller than `i32::MAX`. #22098 is a discussion about if `ldexp` should become a method or stay a function. Since all other operations for floats take self as the first argument I would change `ldexp` to a method.\n\n`frexp` is the counterpart of `ldexp` and should use the same types.\n\nI don't know what should happen with `integer_decode`. C does not have a corresponding function and I also do not know what the use case for this function is. Can somebody please give me a hint? It looks like a port of an [integer-decode-float](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_dec_fl.htm#integer-decode-float) function from Lisp.\n\n`next_after` is a rust port of the `nextafter` C function. I am unsure if it should be stabilized now.\n",

    "body": "`ldexp` and `frexp` are C-isms. I suspect these functions are the way they are not because it's the best design but because the C standard doesn't guarantee anything about the implementation of `float` and `double`. Therefore they did the next best thing, providing a supposedly purely arithmetic operation that matches the implementation details IEEE-like binary floating point extremely well. Take my opinion with a grain of salt, I never had to use those functions in Rust nor in C.But most people that I've heard talk about those functions, they pitch it as a way to manipulate the mantissa and the exponent directly. If that is indeed the primary use case, then I believe it is better served with something closer to `integer_decode`.\n\n@pyfisch Could you elaborate what you're using `ldexp` for?\n",
