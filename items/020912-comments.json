    "body": "\"This function will either need to be implemented in terms of the existing public API or added to the Bitv in the standard library.\"\n\nThat's besides the point, the code above is just an example of a situation where one might want to add functionality to an existing class. Both of your proposed solutions are unlikely to be practical in many cases. For example, in this case using the public API would be horribly slow. Implementing a function in the standard library locally is not portable.\n\nAs I said in my original comment, in C++, you can declare something protected so that people can base their code on yours. In Ruby, you can just add your function to a class or use modules to extend a class. In Rust this is currently not possible, don't you think that this should be considered?\n",
