The programmer is already opting into a fixed address with `static`, adding another layer of lint-ignoring attributes is not the solution. I don't think there is a global optimum, therefor I removed the lint and just left the (to my eyes) obvious cases where a static should be a lint. Mainly non-public statics, small statics and (very few) obvious cases for constants\n",
