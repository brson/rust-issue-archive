Or is my understanding of linking incomplete or overly idealized (entirely possible)?\n\nRegarding \"virtualizing\" the math library in use, that makes sense, I guess it can be emulated in any case by having your program define a `math` module at the root level and changing what that points at.\n",

    "body": "Regarding linking: Did not think about stripping in the static case. In the dynamic case, a program that doesn't deal with floats would not have to link against C lib math at all, so there would be a minimal benefit.\n\nIt would also make testing libmath a bit easier, as it would not require a full build of std :)\n\nRegarding virtualization: If core is linked against lib math, you have to carry it around even you don't use it.  Here my understanding of linking is perhaps insufficient but I think it causes problems to link against two shared libraries that have the same symbols (lib math via core and actually used lib math)?\n",
