    "body": "This is passing tests now. There are two bugs which I would like to fix in follow ups, as they are backwards compatible modulo gated features and don't impact much code (less than 10 occurrences in the whole codebase):\n1. `for &x in foo.iter() { ... x ... }` doesn't pass the borrow check anymore. Instead use `for x in foo.iter() { ... *x ... }`. This is probably not too hard of a fix, but I wanted to get this in for now as this code is _really_ borrow check finicky.\n2. The `for` pattern is no longer macro-hygienic. This is because macro hygiene is applied to each pattern production separately, and this introduces a new pattern production.\n",
