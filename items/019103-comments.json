    "body": "I made some changes to `src/grammar` and the makefiles along the way:\n- update to compile with master,\n- make the `src/grammar/verify.rs` executable built as part of the `check-all` target (apparently this is run on the bots?) to avoid it going completely out of date in future,\n- update the antlr4 grammar to hopefully reflect these lexical changes.\n\nHowever, I don't have antlr4 working properly: I downloaded it and it generated a java file (so my new grammar parses correctly), but building that just gave me a pile of \"symbol not defined\" errors. I don't know how to wrangle java & classpaths into doing what I want very well at all...\n",
