    "body": "Here are my problems with the current arrangement:\n- A second book, and one that claims to be 'advanced', diminishes both the significance of 'The Book' and its brand. It will never have the stature of 'The C Programming Language' if it has a more 'advanced' big brother looming over it.\n- Multiple separate books is a path to balkanization of the docs, where Steve gets his docs, Gankro gets his docs, I get my docs and nobody's working together.\n- Practically, if we now publish The Book, we have to exclude a big chunk of information that people would probably want included.\n- The name is misleading. 'Advanced' has many connotations. This isn't advanced concurrency, or advanced architectural design - it's advanced unsafe.\n",
