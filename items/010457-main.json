  "body": "This commit re-organizes the io::native module slightly in order to have a\nworking implementation of rtio::IoFactory which uses native implementations. The\ngoal is to seamlessly multiplex among libuv/native implementations wherever\nnecessary.\n\nRight now most of the native I/O is unimplemented, but we have existing bindings\nfor file descriptors and processes which have been hooked up. What this means is\nthat you can now invoke println!() from libstd with no local task, no local\nscheduler, and even without libuv.\n\nThere's still plenty of work to do on the native I/O factory, but this is the\nfirst steps into making it an official portion of the standard library. I don't\nexpect anyone to reach into io::native directly, but rather only std::io\nprimitives will be used. Each std::io interface seamlessly falls back onto the\nnative I/O implementation if the local scheduler doesn't have a libuv one\n(hurray trait ojects!)\n",
