  "body": "An alternate implementation of `RingBuf` based on the stdlib `Vec` implementation.\n### Pros\n1. Performance is about 30-40% better for reads and writes than the\n   current `RingBuf`.  See\n   [benchmarks](https://github.com/danburkert/rust-ringbuf#benchmarks).\n2. Implementations for methods that would be impossible to implement\n   (efficiently) for the current `RingBuf`: `as_slices`, `into_vec`, and\n   `from_vec`.\n3. More complete method documentation including significantly more\n   examples.\n4. Implementations for missing `RingBuf` functionality:\n   `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `move_iter`, `truncate`, `reserve_additional`,\n   `reserve`, `shrink_to_fit` and `Eq`.\n### Cons\n1. Based on `Vec`, so a lot of `unsafe`.\n### Tests\n\nI have a fair amount of generative [tests](https://github.com/danburkert/rust-ringbuf/blob/master/src/ringbuf.rs#L959) for the implementation, but they have a dependency on [quickcheck](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck) so I have not included them. The current `RingBuf` tests remain unchanged.\n### Breaking Changes\n\nShould be none.  A strict superset of functionality is provided.\n",
