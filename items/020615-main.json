  "body": "This commit takes a first pass at stabilizing `std::thread`:\n- It removes the `detach` method in favor of two constructors -- `spawn`\n  for detached threads, `scoped` for \"scoped\" (i.e., must-join)\n  threads. This addresses some of the surprise/frustrating debug\n  sessions with the previous API, in which `spawn` produced a guard that\n  on destruction joined the thread (unless `detach` was called).\n  \n  The reason to have the division in part is that `Send` will soon not\n  imply `'static`, which means that `scoped` thread creation can take a\n  closure over _shared stack data_ of the parent thread. On the other\n  hand, this means that the parent must not pop the relevant stack\n  frames while the child thread is running. The `JoinGuard` is used to\n  prevent this from happening by joining on drop (if you have not\n  already explicitly `join`ed.) The APIs around `scoped` are\n  future-proofed for the `Send` changes by taking an additional lifetime\n  parameter. With the current definition of `Send`, this is forced to be\n  `'static`, but when `Send` changes these APIs will gain their full\n  flexibility immediately.\n  \n  Threads that are `spawn`ed, on the other hand, are detached from the\n  start and do not yield an RAII guard.\n  \n  The hope is that, by making `scoped` an explicit opt-in with a very\n  suggestive name, it will be drastically less likely to be caught by a\n  surprising deadlock due to an implicit join at the end of a scope.\n- The module itself is marked stable.\n- Existing methods other than `spawn` and `scoped` are marked stable.\n\nThe migration path is:\n\n``` rust\nThread::spawn(f).detached()\n```\n\nbecomes\n\n``` rust\nThread::spawn(f)\n```\n\nwhile\n\n``` rust\nlet res = Thread::spawn(f);\nres.join()\n```\n\nbecomes\n\n``` rust\nlet res = Thread::scoped(f);\nres.join()\n```\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
