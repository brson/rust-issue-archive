And I assume that compilation finished, so it's not compilation that's going in an infinite loop.\n\nI'm not sure where the bug is here, and if there is one, it seems like it'd be in LLVM, not Rust...\n",

I think that this issue _might_ have something to do with the way debug info is generated. Or it might not - in this case the test will probably have to be modified to ensure that it doesn't compile to tail call even with '-g -O'\n",

    "body": "Discussed this with @erickt on IRC. Based on my understanding on LLVM's optimizations, it's likely that debugging is preventing the inlining of `black_box`, which means that the asm isn't inlined, which means the tail-call optimisation isn't prevented. Whether or not it should do the `call -> tail call` transformation with debugging on is questionable, but Rust is not the place to have that discussion.\n\nMarking `black_box` with `#[inline(always)]` should fix this.\n\nUnless somebody has any objections, I'm going to close this issue.\n",
