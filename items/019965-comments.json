    "body": "I'm not sure I agree that the potential inefficiency of a particular operation is a good reason to lose the symmetry of addition. People doing string manipulation where this kind of thing matters should probably be working more explicitly in the first place; these operators are mainly for convenience.\n\nAlso, it's feasible to reuse the buffer if you wanted -- basically a bit like the `insert` operation on `Vec`, but inserting a whole slice on the left. You could special-case this behavior depending on whether the existing capacity was sufficient, and otherwise allocate a fresh buffer and copy each bit in.\n",

You can always reserve extra space, slide everything to the right in the owned container, and then clone the slice into the empty space for an \"optimal\" solution I believe.\n",
