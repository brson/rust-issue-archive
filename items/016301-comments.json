    "body": "Well, while we are dreaming big\u2026 It would be amazing to automatically _validate_ performance properties (to some extend) using `#[bench]`. E.g.\n\n``` rust\n#[bench(time O(log n), space O(1))]\nfn bench_something(b: &mut Bencher) {\n    b.iter_with_size(|n| {\n        perform_magic!(n)\n    });\n}\n```\n\nThis would of course require (a) a structure where one can easily generate large examples and (b) benching various sized `n`s up to ones large enough to get a significant assumption for asymptotic properties.\n\n(Combine this with a code generator, quickcheck and a small datacenter and you might never need computer science again!)\n",

    "body": "@killercup I don't think the relation between asymptotic and real performance is well-defined enough to permit such functionality. Especially in the face of expected and amortized behaviors. Even `O(1)` can be unstable because e.g. performance is bounded above by some constant, but still scales with input.\n",
