  "body": "These few commits address a few existing issues:\n- #5469 - adding regression tests for `rusti`. This adds unit tests to the `rusti.rc` file (which needed some reorganization of the Makefile, see the first commit message). These are super-simple right now, and sadly can't test the output of the tests. I worked for a bit on making a compiletest version of the rusti tests, but I ended up hitting something which blocked me, although I've forgotten it by this point.\n- #5937 - regression test added, and it's fixed\n- #5803 - just doesn't appear to happen any more\n- #5784 - it's no longer broken, and it no longer spits out warnings about unused variables.\n\nI also did some investigation into #5774, and you may want to read the comment I left on the bug. The gist of the situation is that C++ exceptions across JIT code don't look like they're working, even though they [should be working](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/3aa1122ec25d15a2a73a295f8298ad9c38b09a10/src/rustllvm/RustWrapper.cpp#L387). If anyone has any insight on this, that would be awesome!\n",
