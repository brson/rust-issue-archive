    "body": "Here's an attempt:\nhttps://github.com/HildarTheDorf/RustLinkerBug\n\nType make to try and build. The list of #[link(name=\"\")] might need amending (take a look at `pkg-config --static --libs glfw3` for help, or read the rustc error message). Hopefully you eventually reach the point where glfw-rs functions can't find glfw symbols (and not other errors). You can comment out the #[link(name=\"glfw3\")] to show how many symbols in glfw it IS finding.\n\nFails for me on ubuntu 13.10 x64 with 6532d2fa0d173e4f815ac2144ff9860f5343cd7d, I'll update to master and check it still fails.\n\nNote: I have glfw3.a in my linker search path, I can't see why dropping it in ./lib/ won't work, but I haven't tried it.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that adding `-C link=args=-lglfw3` to RUSTFLAGS will successfully build, with the #[link(name=\"glfw3\")] as well. You can also drop all the #[link()] stuff and just use -C link-args=\"'pkg-config --static --libs glfw3'\" (backticks, not ', but markdown mangles it)\n",
