    "body": "I looked into @dherman's case. It comes down to a trait method defined like this:\n\n``` rust\nfn foo<'root, T:Trait<'root>>(t: T) -> &i32\n```\n\nthe point being that `'root` does not appear in the signature in anyway, and hence has no incoming constraints. In some sense this PR is a reasonable way to fix that problem, though I think that the fix I _really_ want is to guarantee that all type/lifetime parameters to a fn outlive calls to that fn. But that requires some changes to the language to achieve completely. Still, I am somewhat surprised that there aren't incoming edges to the variable from the point where the parameters are instantiated -- I think a reasonable change might be to make it so that when you create a region variable, you must provide a lower bound (which could be `ty::ReEmpty`). I've started a PR to that effect a few times but never quite finished it.\n",

You left in the `fn contraction` method, so at first I thought something more subtle was going on, but all it now does is check that the `ConstrainVarSubReg` constraints hold.\n\nIt seems like the code is just calling out for a simplification pass; e.g. the factoring of `fn check_node` within the body of `fn contract_node`, which made some sense when there was a separate `fn adjust_node` path, just seems like unnecessary abstraction.\n\nIn addition, it would be nice if the README were updated, removing the [discussion of processing the Contracting nodes](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust/tree/0f192f1df4a1cd552ef58bdef816f9bb624cac4d/src/librustc/middle/infer/region_inference#our-current-algorithm).\n\nBut there's no reason to hold up this PR for those kinds of changes.\n",
