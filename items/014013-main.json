  "body": "This patch adds the coloring function on Windows console to libterm.\nFixes #13400, and makes working on MSYS slightly more pleasant.\n\n_Quick Notes_\n- Extract `trait TerminalOps<T>` from `Terminal<T>`.\n- Add `struct WindowsConsole<T>` along with `Terminal<T>`, both implements `TerminalOps<T>`.\n- `term::Terminal::new` is now `term::new_terminal`, returns `~TerminalOps<T>`.\n- Windows-specific code, including `WindowsConsole<T>`, is in the module `windows`.\n- It will assume it's running on terminal that understands ASCII if $TERM is \"xterm\". Attempts to not break rxvt.exe.\n- It spams `:Send` to deal with libsyntax, which packs Terminal into a RefCell. I couldn't come up with any smarter fix.\n\nI had to remove `Terminal::unwrap()` to implement `Drop` on `WindowsConsole<T>`, thus it lose the way to manually destroy itself. I suppose it's okay, since I couldn't find any use of it in the tree.\nAlso, it will not be possible to access the members of `Terminal<T>`, such as TermInfo. It's still possible to see terminfo by calling `term::terminfo::parser::compiled::parse`, though.\n\nAs this is Windows-only improvement, I'm not sure about breaking change is acceptable. I can consider more humble way to do this, if it doesn't pay.\n",
