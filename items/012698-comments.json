    "body": "@pongad: `Clone` doesn't do a deep clone. It's defined as doing the minimum possible work to produce `T` from `&T`. For example, with `Rc<T>` it performs a reference count. In contrast, `DeepClone` allocates a new `Rc<T>` box and does a `deep_clone()` of the contained `T`.\n\nI have no doubt that it's useful to provide deep clones for `Rc<T>` and removing the methods is a loss of useful functionality. Whether it should be a trait is another question, but it's certainly useful to be able to derive the `DeepClone` implementation for a `struct` or `enum` containing `Rc<T>`.\n\nI don't see a reason to force users to write `Rc::new(box.borrow().clone())` and leave full deep clones as an open problem to be solved manually. We don't force people to write `~((*x).clone())`...\n",
