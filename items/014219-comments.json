But it's a lot less likely that someone will be willing to use a feature-gated string just to avoid writing an `impl Default`.\n\nIn any case, my point still stands that, unless we actually believe that we may change the attribute syntax to allow arbitrary token trees, then feature-gating this doesn't make sense. The only good reason to feature-gate it is so that making that change to attributes doesn't break anyone who's already using this feature. But unless we think we're actually going to make such a change, that reason doesn't apply. And if we feature-gate it now on the off chance that we decide to make that change later, then it will never get un-feature-gated (because it was based on a hypothetical, one that will remain possible indefinitely).\n",

    "body": "@alexcrichton I was under the impression that the ability to customize `#[deriving]` was generally regarded as something we'd like to have? Certainly every time I've seen someone mention a desire to have pluggable derivings the responses was always universally in favor of the idea.\n\nAs for customizing the ability of existing `#[deriving]`, I can't think offhand of any other derivings where such customizability makes sense.\n\n> The idea in general seems appealing, but it also doesn't seem that far off from just writing `impl Default` yourself.\n\nSure, and the ability to write `int x = 3` in C++11 structs isn't too far off from just saying `x(3)` in all your constructors. But it was done because it's a convenient feature that people like. Similarly, the ability to derive `Default` is nice, but it only works if every single field implements it. This PR is largely meant to solve the case where only one field doesn't implement it but the default is correct for everything else.\n\n> Allowing arbitrary expressions in strings also seems... interesting.\n\nI agree it's unfortunate, but the only real alternatives are to either allow arbitrary token streams in attributes, or to add syntax `x: int = 42` to the actual language itself, which I don't think we want to do.\n\n> collect some more compelling use cases before adding a feature such as this.\n\nI think the most compelling reason to do this is the fact that almost _nothing_ uses `#[deriving(Default)]`, and that's because very little of our standard libraries actually bother to provide `Default` implementations. In fact, the only types I can see in our standard library that use `#[deriving(Default)]` are `glob::MatchOptions` and `glob::Pattern`.\n\nThe idea is that by lowering the amount of effort it takes to provide a `Default` implementation, it's more likely for people to actually implement it.\n",

    "body": "All of those with the exception of Encodable/Decodable would require passing the field (or the entire struct) in to the expression. I don't see how to handle that, without doing something like `#[show=\"|field| field.display()\"]` which I think is pretty gross. A single stand-alone expression as a string is unfortunate enough, but embedding a whole closure in there? That's just too far.\n\nEncodable/Decodable I didn't think of. And actually, I do want to do precisely that sort of thing. Go supports the ability to e.g. change the name of the field when encoding to JSON. It would be really convenient if Rust could do the same thing. This was even suggested recently in IRC. Although since it's actually a generic Encodable/Decodable that's implemented rather than specifically JSON support, I'd be really cautious about trying to do that.\n\nThat said, the existence of `#[default]` does not mean we must go hog-wild with everything. With the exception of the unfortunate aspect that the expression must be contained in a string, `#[default]` is rather straightforward and turns the currently nearly useless `#[deriving(Default)]` into something that we can actually use. None of the other suggestions are straightforward or simple, and thus I don't expect anyone to naturally assume that the existence of `#[default]` means the others are obviously desired.\n",

I don't see\n> how to handle that, without doing something like #[show=\"|field|\n> field.display()\"] which I think is pretty gross. A single stand-alone\n> expression as a string is unfortunate enough, but embedding a whole closure\n> in there? That's just too far.\n> \n> Encodable/Decodable I didn't think of. And actually, I do want to do\n> precisely that sort of thing. Go supports the ability to e.g. change the\n> name of the field when encoding to JSON. It would be really convenient if\n> Rust could do the same thing. This was even suggested recently in IRC.\n> Although since it's actually a generic Encodable/Decodable that's\n> implemented rather than specifically JSON support, I'd be really cautious\n> about trying to do that.\n> \n> That said, the existence of #[default] does not mean we must go hog-wild\n> with everything. With the exception of the unfortunate aspect that the\n> expression must be contained in a string, #[default] is rather\n> straightforward and turns the currently nearly useless\n> #[deriving(Default)] into something that we can actually use. None of the\n> other suggestions are straightforward or simple, and thus I don't expect\n> anyone to naturally assume that the existence of #[default] means the\n> others are obviously desired.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14219#issuecomment-43173716\n> .\n",
