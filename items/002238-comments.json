    "body": "[pcwalton's pretty printer](https://github.com/pcwalton/rustfmt), similar to `go fmt`.\n\nGo also has `go build`, `go clean`, `go test`, and `go run`, similar to `cargo build`, `cargo clean`, `cargo test`, and `cargo run`; though Cargo adds the `new`, `bench`, and `update` commands.\n\nConceivably, in addition to `rust build`, `rust clean`, `rust test`, `rust run`,  `rust new`, `rust bench`, `rust update`, `rust doc`, `rust fmt`, there would also be a `rust compile` for rustc.\n\nAnd should rusti ever return, then just `rust` could begin the interpreter. The same goes for rust-bindgen being adopted and `rust bindgen`. This seems like a cleaner solution than the jumble of executables that currently exist.\n",
