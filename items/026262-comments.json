I agree, the current logic is too simplistic (it's also something I've been writing up in this RFC I keep talking about...). Basically, it currently considers all input/type parameters which appear as constrianed, but it ought to stop at projections. I made this gist, which is a similar example: https://gist.github.com/0c562768aeb9412269ce\n",
