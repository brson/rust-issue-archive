    "body": "I admit to being slightly confused as to why `PhantomFn` and `MarkerTrait` are deprecated. This happened in #23938 (Remove variances from traits and deprecate `PhantomFn`/`MarkerTrait`). But `MarkerTrait` is still used as the super trait of the other markers (`Send`, `Sized`, and `Reflect`).\n\nAs near as I can tell, without using either of these two deprecated traits, the only way to declare a marker-like trait (e.g. one that doesn't use `Self`) is to use an associated type with `PhantomData`, e.g.\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo {\n    type _phantom = PhantomData<Self>;\n}\n```\n\nAnd it's not even clear if this is \"correct\". #23938 says that traits no longer have variance, so I guess it's ok? But I don't actually know.\n\n/cc @nikomatsakis \n",
