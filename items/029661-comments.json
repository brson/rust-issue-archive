    "body": "@SimonSapin \n\n> This seems very restrictive (and in particular would prevent my use case). What\u2019s the reason for this?\n\nThere is a basic tradeoff here, having to do with soundness. Basically, there are two options at the extreme:\n- Do not allow default methods to assume anything about defaulted associated types; in return, you can pick and choose which defaults to use in your impl.\n- Allow default methods to \"see\" defaulted associated types; in return, if you override any defaulted associated types, you have to override _all_ defaulted methods. Otherwise, you could get unsound code (based on incorrect type assumptions).\n\nThis is described in slightly more detail in [the RFC](https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/associated-items/active/0000-associated-items.md#defaults).\n\nOriginally we proposed to go with the second route, but it has tended to feel pretty hokey, and we've been leaning more toward the first route.\n\n(Incidentally, much the same question comes up for [specialization](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210).)\n\nI'm happy to elaborate further, but wanted to jot off a quick response for now.\n",

    "body": "@SimonSapin Possibly, but we have a pretty strong bias toward being explicit in signatures about that sort of thing, rather than trying to infer it from the code. It's always a bad surprise when changing the body of a function in one place can cause a downstream crate to fail typechecking.\n\nYou could consider having some explicit \"grouping\" of items that get to see a given default associated type.\n\nI'm not sure if you've been following the [specialization RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210), but part of the proposal is a generalization of default implementations in traits. Imagine something like the following alternative design for `Add` (rather than having `AddAssign` separately):\n\n``` rust\ntrait Add<Rhs=Self> {\n    type Output;\n    fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;\n    fn add_assign(&mut self, Rhs);\n}\n\n// the `default` qualifier here means (1) not all items are impled\n// and (2) those that are can be further specialized\ndefault impl<T: Clone, Rhs> Add<Rhs> for T {\n    fn add_assign(&mut self, rhs: R) {\n        let tmp = self.clone() + rhs;\n        *self = tmp;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis feature lets you refine default implementations given additional type information. You can have many such `default impl` blocks for a given trait, and the follow specialization rules.\n\nThe fact that you can have multiple such blocks might give us a natural way to delimit the scopes in which associated types are visible (and hence in which the methods have to be overridden when those types are).\n",

    "body": "I just had one idea that would help ergonomics a lot. I'll call it \"final associated types\" for the purpose of this explanation. The idea is that some traits define associated types and sometimes, they use them as type parameters of other types. A notable example is the `Future` trait.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Future {\r\n    type Item;\r\n    type Error;\r\n                          // |  This is long and annoying to write and read\r\n                          // V\r\n    fn poll(&mut self) -> Poll<Self::Item, Self::Error>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would be nice is being able to write this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Future {\r\n    type Item;\r\n    type Error;\r\n    // This is practically type alias.\r\n    // Can't be changed in trait impl, only used.\r\n    final type Poll = Poll<Self::Item, Self::Error>;\r\n\r\n    fn poll(&mut self) -> Self::Poll;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would also help various cases when one has associated type called `Error` and want's to return `Result<T, Self::Error>` one could write this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Foo {\r\n    type Error;\r\n    // It can be generic\r\n    final type Result<T> = Result<T, Self::Error>;\r\n\r\n    fn foo(&mut self) -> Self::Result<u32>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Should I write an RFC, or could this be part of something else?",

    "body": "The RFC does not mention how defaults in trait objects are supposed to behave when the default type mentions the `Self` type. For example, here:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Tr {\r\n    type Ty = &'static Self;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf an object type like `dyn Tr` is created, what is `Ty` supposed to be?\r\n\r\nDefaults in type parameters bail out in this case and require the user to specify a type explicitly. We could do the same here.\r\n\r\nEDIT: After a conversation [on Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/442252698964721669/443151243398086667/589882486096658453) it looks like this should go with the same solution as default type parameters (bail out and require the user to specify the type)",

Many of the tests in `test/ui/associated-types/default*` can probably be duplicated to test defaults with `dyn`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther than that, @nikomatsakis (or others) what is meant by `Correct defaults in impls (const)` in the top post? Does that just mean adding tests for this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Trait {\r\n    type Foo = u8;\r\n    // currently \"associated type defaults can't be assumed inside the trait defining them\"\r\n    const Bar: Self::Foo = 100;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich AIUI is [rejected by the RFC](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2532-associated-type-defaults.html#background-and-the-status-quo), meaning the compiler handles it correctly.",

    "body": "Does the current syntax rob us of a way to use trait-defined types? Take a look at this sample:\n\n```rust\ntrait Foo { \n    type Foo: Constraint;\n    type Bar: Constraint;\n    ...\n    type Baz: Constraint;\n\n    type Sender = std::sync::mpsc::Sender<long type declaration here, that mixes and matches between other associated types of trait Foo>;\n}\n```\n\nthat could be used by *users of* **implementations of** `Foo` as type aliases to simplify interacting with `Foo` types. \n\nThat's still doable if the syntax is interpreted as \"default type\" instead of \"type alias\", but does it rob us of using it that way in the future? Would it require a different proposal to \"lock down\" the type definition or would you just be SOL if you tried to redefine the \"default associated type\" instead of going with what the default was?",
