    "body": "I'm having this problem too. It makes rust very difficult to use on Windows because panics take a long time to track down.\n\nI looked into it, and the symbols produced during compile don't seem to be compatible with SymFromAddr(). The exe does has symbols which can be seen with dumpbin and nm. I googled for a while trying to figure out why the symbols are incompatible, but didn't find anything. Maybe someone else understands more about this.\n\nOne way to fix this would be to use something other than SymFromAddr() to get the symbol names. I'm not sure how nm works but it seems to have enough information to do the symbol lookups. It also understand the format for the line numbers unlike both dumpbin and SymGetLineFromAddr().\n",

    "body": "The crux of the matter here is that Windows' dbghelp API does not understand DWARF debug info, so it only sees the exported symbols of the module.  It then reports all addresses relative to the nearest exported symbol.  Of which 'main' is usually the only one in an .exe module, so your whole callstack is reported relative to that.  There's also an offset, but Rust's backtrace doesn't print that.\nThe easiest way to get a backtrace is to start your program under gdb, slap a breakpoint on 'rust_panic', then print a backtrace via 'bt' when it is hit.\n",
