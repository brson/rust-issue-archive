    "body": "We had originally explicitly decided to not have module-level control over the feature set, but that decision didn't really have a reason other than \"it feels right\".\n\nOne thing to consider with module-level control is whether modules should the have the ability to deny features? Do we want something like `#[feature(+feature1, -feature2)]`? I don't think we'd want to do that, but I can imagine that someone will at some point want to do that.\n",

It's possibly useful in terms of restricting which parts of a the crate are experimental (e.g. I could imagine most of a crate being stable, with certain parts pushing the boundaries of the type system etc. with feature flags). On the note of infection, https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/475 means these will be forced to infect the entire crate with only-usable-with-nightly-itis.\n",
