  "body": "When creating a staticlib, it unzips all static archives it finds and then\ninserts the files manually into the output file. This process is done through\n`ar`, and `ar` doesn't like if you specify you want to add files and you don't\ngive it any files.\n\nThis case arose whenever you linked to an archive that didn't have any contents\nor all of the contents were filtered out. This just involved ignoring the case\nwhere the number of inputs we have is 0, because we don't have any files to add\nanyway.\n",
