I think a by-name curated list, pointing at git/svn/hg repositories (tags for versions) OR multiple tarballs (one per version), would be more useful. If we support 'registering' multiple source lists (as in apt) that would be nicely decentralized, allow for a tool that indexes and searches packages, etc.\n\n(Which is for the future.

    "body": "This is great. I'm glad to see such things develop. A few notes:\n- I agree with marijn that if we're going to have a central (and hopefully, apt-like, extensible) registry-of-packages (say cargo.rust-lang.org as a default that we operate) we ought to permit grabbing them by short-name as well as UUID. That is, we should insist that anyone registering a package in a given cargo registry makes their package name unique to that registry, and the tool should probably default to just searching for a short-name, in the configured registries, if asked to fetch/install a schema-less pkgref (one lacking a \":\" character)\n- Rust can run subprocesses and (using librustc) parse its own crates. I was hoping to have this sort of tool not require too many additional tools; at risk of asking you to rewrite _again_, do you think this could be done in rust, and use crate-file attributes rather than separate manifests to dictate additional information? Just trying to err on the side of \"fewest possible moving parts\". Requiring python and shelling out to configure-and-make seems like more parts than I'd imagined.\n\nIn any case, promising start! I like the look of it.\n",

As for parsing .rc files / rewriting in rust, I think that is a good idea; I didn't do it at first because I was unfamiliar with the librustc API. I believe that cargo as it is now (the python version) could be rewritten using only crate metadata.\n\nThe reason I wanted to add invocations of configure/make is to support packages that have native components. Does rustc know how to build native code if it's required by a crate file?\n\nI will make an attempt at rewriting cargo in rust tonight.\n",
