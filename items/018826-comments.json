    "body": "Ah, I overlooked @jakub- already mentioned `curses.has_colors()`...\n\nSo we have two issues:\n1. Windows(NT) doesn't support ANSI escape sequence at all.  `colorama` addresses this issue by wrapping `stdout` and  translating them to corresponding Win32 API.  That's a nice addition.  But...\n2. Some tools like Travis which parses redirected stdout might get confused by ANSI escape sequences.  `colorama` doesn't help here, so something like [`os.isatty()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html?highlight=isatty#os.isatty) would be necessary after all.\n\n```\n(foo)$ cat a.py    \nimport colorama\nprint(colorama.Fore.RED + \"Hello\")\n(foo)$ python a.py | xxd\n0000000: 1b5b 3331 6d48 656c 6c6f 0a              .[31mHello.\n```\n\nBecause of 2, we need to programatically switch on/off terminal coloring depending on the result of `os.isatty()`.  Then hard-coding ANSI escape sequence is no good and we need a clever use of either `curses.tigetstr()` etc. or `colorama.Fore.*`.\n\nIn my previous comment, I almost suggested to disable terminal coloring on Windows by simply checking `curses.has_colors()` (because I don't use Windows at all :grin:)\n",
