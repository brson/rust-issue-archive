The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @brson (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. The way Github handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

    "body": "Does this change which type needs to impl Debug?\n\nImagine left_val and right_val are `String`, previous code:\n\n```\nif *left_val == *right_val {\n   println!(\"{:?} == {:?}\", *left_val, *right_val);\n}\n```\n\nPrevious code would have it compare as `str` and print as `&str`.\n\nNew code compares `str` and prints as `&String`.\n\nThe potential breaking change comes when `String` does not impl Debug but `str` does. Is my thinking around this correct? Of course `String/str` is fine, but if you substitute user defined types it illustrates the problem.\n\nWorkaround would be to use `&*left_val` instead of removing the \\* entirely.\n",
