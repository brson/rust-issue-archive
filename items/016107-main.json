  "body": "Our implementation of ebml has diverged from the standard in order to better serve the needs of the compiler, so it doesn't make much sense to call what we have ebml anyore. Furthermore, our implementation is pretty crufty, and should eventually be rewritten into a format that better suits the needs of the compiler. This patch factors out serialize::ebml into librbml, otherwise known as the Really Bad Markup Language. This is a stopgap library that shouldn't be used by end users, and will eventually be replaced by something better.\n\ncc @pcwalton, @alexcrichton\n",
