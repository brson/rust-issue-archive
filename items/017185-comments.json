    "body": "@vberger Please do!\n\nFor reference, the stability lint (which includes deprecation) is currently coded to _ignore_ any output from macros. This was done to solve the opposite problem: macros that use unstable/deprecated items in their definition should not cause warnings for macro users.\n\nGetting this right is going to be tricky, because you'd need to distinguish which parts of a macro's output came from its definition, versus client-supplied code. While that's plausible for macro rules, doing it for syntax extensions seems difficult if not impossible.\n\nSee https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15728, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15703, and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15726\n",

    "body": "@aturon Thanks for the links! Currently, my approach was indeed to try to ignore code that was generated by the macro, marking for lint only nodes declared outside of macro invocation, using `expn_info` to discriminate them.\n\nI managed to have the example in this issue running, but encountered issues with `fail!` (using it in a deprecated function marked it's internal `static` variable as deprecated as well, and raised a warning because it was used). It is indeed trickier than I first expected.\n",
