  "body": "Previously, the parser would not allow you to simultaneously implement a\nfunction with a different abi as well as being unsafe at the same time. This\nextends the parser to allow functions of the form:\n\n```\nunsafe extern fn foo() {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe closure type grammar was also changed to reflect this reversal, types\npreviously written as \"extern unsafe fn()\" must now be written as\n\"unsafe extern fn()\". The parser currently has a hack which allows the old\nstyle, but this will go away once a snapshot has landed.\n\nCloses #10025\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
