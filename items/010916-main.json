  "body": "When performing LTO, the rust compiler has an opportunity to completely strip\nall landing pads in all dependent libraries. I've modified the LTO pass to\nrecognize the -Z no-landing-pads option when also running an LTO pass to flag\neverything in LLVM as nothrow. I've verified that this prevents any and all\ninvoke instructions from being emitted.\n\nI believe that this is one of our best options for moving forward with\naccomodating use-cases where unwinding doesn't really make sense. This will\nallow libraries to be built with landing pads by default but allow usage of them\nin contexts where landing pads aren't necessary.\n",
