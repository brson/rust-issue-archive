    "body": "Copying my post on the mailing list here:\n\nThe aversion to a standalone functions in this thread and in our community in general is concerning. Not everything has to be a method or associated function! There is no single thing being constructed here - both ends of the channel are being constructed at once.\n\nWhatever names we choose for the sender and receiver ends of the pipe/channel, it would be nice to have the sender first in the tuple and the receiver last. Here is an ASCII diagram to help illustrate why I think this ordering makes sense:\n\n```\nchannel() -> (Sender, Receiver)\n\nSender::send(T) >== channel ==> Receiver::recv() -> T\n```\n\nNot saying that `Sender`, `Receiver` or `channel()` are the names we should pick - just illustrating how a well designed API can help reinforce the fact that the message is \u2018sent\u2019 down one end, and \u2018received\u2019 once it pops out the other.\n\nThe other thing we must consider is how the type names of the two ends of the pipe would be reflected in client code. `Sender` and `Receiver` when combined with the `send` and `recv` method names tend to look stuttery if you use the type names for the identifiers, :\n\n``` rust\nlet (sender, receiver) = channel();\nsender.send(x);\nlet y = receiver.recv();\n```\n",

But:\n- I also think @bjz makes a pretty good point that there's nothing wrong with standalone functions. \n- For something so visible in Rust, it'd be nice to have a more personal touch than `(Sender, Receiver)`.\n\nOut of these options, my vote goes to `channel() -> (Source, Sink)` or `channel() -> (Source, Drain)`.\n",

    "body": "From 3.3.1 in _Concurrent Programming in ML_, Reppy writes:\n\n> Channels in CML are bidirectional; a thread that has access to a channel can both send and receive messages on it. A safer discipline would be to distinguish between input and output accesses to a channel, so that threads could be restricted to only send or receive on a channel. Another way to think of a channel is as a directional pipe, with each end represented by a value of a different type. While such a view of channels could be built into the language, in CML we can use events to provide this different style of channels as a first-class abstraction. The interface signature for directional channels is given in Listing 3.5. Values of the `in_chan` type can only be used to read messages, and those of the `out_ch` type can only be used to send messages.\n\n``` sml\n(* Listing 3.5: Directional channels signature *)\n\nsignature DIR_CHAN =\n    sig\n        type \u2019a in_chan and \u2019a out_chan\n\n        val channel : unit -> (\u2019a in_chan * \u2019a out_chan)\n        val recv    : \u2019a in_chan -> \u2019a\n        val send    : (\u2019a out_chan * \u2019a) -> unit\n\n        val recvEvt : \u2019a in_chan -> \u2019a event\n        val sendEvt : (\u2019a out_chan * \u2019a) -> unit event\n    end;\n```\n",

    "body": "@TheHydroImpulse: That's what many languages do, CML, Erlang, Go, etc, but as I quoted above, even Reppy, the designer of CML says, \"A safer discipline would be to distinguish between input and output accesses to a channel, so that threads could be restricted to only send or receive on a channel.\" It would be interesting to hear from @larsbergstrom whether he knows why bidirectional channels were chosen as CML's primitives (he has more experience with CML than I).\n\nOf course it seems to be relatively easy to build directional channels on top of bi-directional channels and vice versa. ~~I think from memory we have a `SyncChan` in `extra::comm`. The issue with that is they can't be cloned easily now that `SharedPort` was removed.~~ Woops `SyncChan` is directional too (facepalm). I do think it would be easy to create one from our current primitives though.\n",

We're going to see a lot of `let (sender, reciever) = Chan::open()` where now it's `let (port, chan) = Chan::new()`. 'port' and 'chan' both being 4 letters is very aesthetic. Maybe this ugliness can be overcome by naming conventions ('s'/'r', 'sendr'/'recvr', 'in'/'out', etc.) or maybe I can just get used to it.\n2) The stuttering problem @bjz mentioned.\n3) I guess that's it...\n",

Sure, source/sink seems a bit ambiguous at first glance, but thinking about the intent of a channel for a short period of time clears it up neatly. Similar could be said for sendr/recvr -- it seems awkward now, but perhaps people would warm up to it given time.\n\nI think that the right decision will naturally arise if we give the different proposals some time to `sink` in.\n\nThen again, another serious contender could still arise. Perhaps channel isn't even the most evocative metaphor that we could come up with, if that's the name of the game (`egg.lay()` and `nest.hatch()`, anyone?). Or alternatively, two _new_ words altogether could be created.\n\n@bstrie of course has a point about bikeshedding. There are an infinite number of possibilities that we could take with this. I think, though, since `channel` is so important to rust, that the names need to be carefully decided upon.\n",

    "body": "### Hey You Asked For Bikeshedding\n\n### --OR--\n\n### Why Everyone Is Wrong Forever\n\n-1 to `Source` and `Sink`/`Drain`. People arguing for it must surely see that these terms are no more intuitive than `Port` and `Chan`.\n\n@bjz, I'm totally fine with a free function. After all, that's what it was for the longest time. :) HOWEVER, if we're going to embrace free functions, then let's not get in the habit of naming them after nouns. `channel` isn't a verb. If what you really want is a noun, then that's what we have `Foo::new` for.\n\nWhile we're at it I'm not sure where arose this sentiment that `Foo::new` must always return a `Foo` type, with no exceptions. Rules are made to be excepted, especially in exceptional circumstances. Blind adherence to this rule would mean that we can _never_ construct a tuple, even if it's the best fit for the situation. Chans are sufficiently exceptional (and sufficiently fundamental to Rust) that this is really a non-issue.\n\nWhile we're at what we're at while we're at it, `Chan::open` is a poor name for constructing an entangled pair of unidirectional endpoints. The implied analogy to files would imply accessing something that already exists. Just because it's a tuple doesn't mean it deserves to be a pariah with an arbitrarily different name for its constructor.\n\nAs for the names of the endpoints themselves, there are an infinity of potential names. If you want to exclusively optimize for clarity, you literally cannot argue against `Sender` and `Receiver`. If you want something that's clear but also shorter to type, maybe try `Src` and `Dest` (one character shorter than `Port` and `Chan`!). If you want _ludicrously_ short, then just go with `In` and `Out`. And if you're trying to optimize for coolness, I'd suggest `Transmitter` and `Receiver` so that we can call bidirectional chan endpoints \"transceivers\". :)\n",

How to easily spell a useful word (receive) correctly is not a big question. Benefit from the type inference, users don't need to use it explicitly:\n\n```\nlet (s,r) = channel();\n```\n\nI like this too:\n\n```\nChan::open() -> (Sender, Receiver)\n```\n",

    "body": "There's nothing wrong with straightforward and simple names. I _want_ these names to be both straightforward and simple. But I also want them to be elegantly named and lacking redundancy. It's not about cleverness. `Sender` and `Receiver` sound straight out of java or something; does anyone really want to see `sender.send()` and `receiver.recv()` everywhere? To make somewhat of a straw man argument, we might as well rename `channel()` to `createSenderAndReceiver()`, since channel isn't really explicit about what it's doing. i.e. it could be a single struct that both sends and receives, it could disallow having multiple senders, etc.\n\nIt might seem like I'm unnecessarily bikeshedding this, but let me remind everyone that bikeshedding is what got us to `Sender` and `Receiver` in the first place. Channels are high profile; it wouldn't be the end of the world to go with `Sender` and `Receiver`, but it seems to me Rust deserves better.\n",

    "body": "We should keep in mind the design space for a second flavor of channels when considering new names for the current channels. We're thinking of adding a synchronous-send channel which can either have a buffer or not (it always blocks waiting for a slot in the buffer if it's empty). \n\nWith these new channels, we should consider what we're going to name the in tandem with the current channels. Right now we have `Chan` and `Port` and in theory this would add a `SyncChan`. Would we have a `channel()` and `sync_channel()` function returning a `Sender` and a `SyncSynder`?

    "body": "> I do like the idea that each half is a \"port\" to the whole concept of a channel.\n\nWhile I agree that \"port\" is a nice way to describe an end of a channel, I do not think that having it in the name we provide to the user is useful; as you noticed, we'd still have to attach another word (like \"Send\" or \"Recv\") to make it meaningful. And \"Recv\" being shortened kinda gives it away that \"Port\" is useless in the name and doesn't pull its own weight but merely adds to the letters the user has to type out.\n\n\"Source\" and \"Sink\" are short and unambiguous. Conceptually, they're ports but making them \"SourcePort\" and \"SinkPort\" is just adding letters for no benefit.\n\n\"Sender\" and \"Receiver\" are also fine (though longer than \"Source\" and \"Sink\" for IMO no increase in readability); I'd strongly encourage avoiding adding more butchered shorthands like \"Recv\" to the standard library. Frankly, Rust already suffers for it.\n",

To reiterate @brson's comment (https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/11765#issuecomment-35050596), this ticket needs these changes:\n- Rename `Chan<T>` to `Sender<T>`\n- Rename `Port<T>` to `Receiver<T>`\n- Rename `Chan::new` to `channel` (and put `channel` in the prelude)\n- Rename variables/fields for the old `Chan` type to a derivative `tx`\n- Rename variables/fields for the old `Port` type to a derivative `rx`\n\nThe only outstanding decision I can think of are what `PortReader` and `ChanWriter` should become, and I'd recommend `ChanWriter` and `ChanReader` now that we have the design space open up (these types are readers/writers of channels).\n",
