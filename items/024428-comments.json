Some of these functions can get by with `no_std`, which makes them more generally useful (though you might argue that this is less useful nowadays).\n2. Each piece of functionality requires its own relatively large set of Unicode tables. Separating them means that these can be brought into a project piecemeal rather than all at once. (TBQH I'm not sure the extent to which rustc does link time optimization, but in the best case LTO would render this concern moot, at least for optimized builds.)\n\nI suppose one other point in favor is that there are already a few small crates out there that provide their own small bits of Unicode functionality, so an omnibus crate would end up either duplicating their functionality or requiring people to pull in multiple crates anyway.\n",

    "body": "I think maybe you all are talking about different things:\n\nOne is: should these three new `unicode-*` crates on crates.io be a single `unicode` crate on crates.io? I personally tend to prefer multiple smaller single-purpose crates over fewer larger crates containing multiple loosely-related features, but this is debatable.\n\nThe other is: should this functionality be in a crate distributed with rustc? (As opposed to crates.io.) [The `unicode` crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/libunicode) perhaps should be renamed `rustc_unicode`, if only to clarify what we\u2019re talking about. It serves two purpose (with some overlap): provide functionality used in the compile itself, and provide functionality to be re-exported in `std`.\n\nAs @kwantam said, removing them from `std` (in favor of crates.io) has been discussed before.\n\nBut there is some compiler usage where this PR simply adds `#[allow(deprecated)]`. I think there should be a better path forward for the compiler, IMO \u201cdeprecated\u201d means we intend to remove this at some point. Perhaps the required functionality could stay non-depracated in `rustc_unicode` (where using it directly would require `#![feature(rustc_private)]` and only the `std`/`collections` wrappers would be deprecated.\n",

    "body": "@SimonSapin I agree regarding renaming libunicode. I was going to suggest libcore_unicode: the non-deprecated functionality really is being used in libcore, libcollections, and libstd, so calling it librustc_unicode might be suggestive of a narrower set of uses than is actually the case.\n\nRegarding the use of `width()` in librustc_driver and libsyntax: there are a couple spots where this is done for pretty printing. I argued in #24402 that these can just be removed, because they will almost never impact correctness of the pretty printed output. We can also just leave the width tables and functionality behind a feature gate if there's objection to removing them.\n\nIf there's general consensus on a rename, I can rename libunicode to whatever name we decide (libcore_unicode and librustc_unicode have been suggested so far), and then leave behind a dummy libunicode that re-exports everything from lib{core,rustc}_unicode with a `#deprecated` tag to push people toward fixing their code.\n",

We've long thought that these APIs would move out of the standard library at some point as they've stuck out as not quite belonging for some time now, but we may not have communicated that clearly enough.\n\nRight now we don't have a great story for external libraries in the rust-lang organization (and elsewhere) in terms of evolving their API, possibly coming back into libstd, etc. I would expect an RFC if these libraries are to be re-included, but for now I wouldn't expect an RFC to move unstable features out into external crates.\n",
