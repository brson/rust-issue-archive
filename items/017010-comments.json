How is `1e300` related to 'normal-sized integers'?

    "body": "About how to fix this issue:\nI think there are five possibilities:\n1. Add an assertion so that `range` fails if adding one does nothing. (This may have a huge performance impact.)\n2. Implement `range` for integers only.\n3. Implement `range` using a successor trait. Do or do not implement that trait for floats. (This has the advantage of being able to define `range` for chars.)\n4. Do nothing and accept that `size_hint` may be wrong and the iterator may not terminate for floats. This behavior should be mentioned in the documentation however.\n5. Make `size_hint` not return an upper bound. (This only fixes the size hint. It would be more correct, because currently the code implicitly assumes `x + One::one() != x`.)\n\n(I would favor 2. or 3.)\n\n_Edit:_ @thestinger I removed the paragraph about Python's range, because it was talking past each other.\n\n> The range function isn't just a wrapper around range_step, it provides a double-ended iterator intended to be based on predecessors / successors.\n\nI don't know what the intention was when `range` was first implemented. But you could implement (a bit redundantly) `DoubleEndedIterator` for `RangeStep` as well, so I don't really see why that shows any intention to be different than `range_step`.\n",
