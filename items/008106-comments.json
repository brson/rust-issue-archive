    "body": "It's mostly because our IR is resulting in poor optimization right now, because LLVM is designed to consume clang's output. The way clang handles this is to truncate down to i1 after a load, and zext to i8 before a store. Since there are range assertions output for the loads, LLVM will optimize the truncation to a no-op, resulting in it branching directly on the value in every case.\n\nWe do actually output range assertions now, but they're not triggering the relevant knowledge in LLVM.\n\nThere are also currently issues like this, because we aren't truncating to i1:\n\n```\nstrcat | rusti: let x = 5 as bool; (x, x == true)\n    -- | Notice(rusti): (true, false)\n```\n\nI could try to put together an isolated example where using `i1` leads to better results.\n",

    "body": "And I found an example where it really stops optimizations:\n\n``` rust\n// optimized to ret 0\nfn foo(i: uint) -> uint {if i % 5 == 1 {if i % 4 == 0 {i % 4}else{0}}else{0}}\n// not optimized to ret 0\nfn foo(i: uint) -> uint {if i % 5 == 1 && i % 4 == 0 {i % 4}else{0}}\n```\n\n``` c\n// optimized in clang to ret 0, but I think it does short-circuiting differently,\n// so it's equivalent to the optimized rustc one\nunsigned long foo(unsigned long i) {return (i % 5 == 1 && i % 4 == 0) ? i % 4 : 0;}\n```\n\nI realized the same thing as @thestinger by looking at the [output of --emit-llvm](https://gist.github.com/eddyb/80e4b9d61056cefe7881#file-rustc-ll).\nBy [manually editing](https://gist.github.com/eddyb/80e4b9d61056cefe7881#file-rustc-manually-edited-ll) that output to get rid of the two casts to `i8`, and optimizing it again, I've obtained [an improved version](https://gist.github.com/eddyb/80e4b9d61056cefe7881#file-rustc-manually-edited-plus-opt-ll).\n\n**Update**: the missing link in the optimization process is `%.demorgan = and i1 %3, %5` implying `%5 = icmp eq i64 %4, 0`, replacing the use of `%.demorgan` with `%5` produces `ret 0`.\nI've tested with the LLVM version currently bundled with rust, so I believe this last step is a still unsolved LLVM issue.\n\n``` c\n// this non-short-circuiting example behaves just like the unoptimized rust one,\n// with my manual bool optimization applied\nunsigned long foo(unsigned long i) {return (i % 5 == 1 & i % 4 == 0) ? i % 4 : 0;}\n```\n",
