  "body": "A quick rundown:\n- added `file::{readdir, stat, mkdir, rmdir}`\n- Added access-constrained versions of `FileStream`; `FileReader` and `FileWriter` respectively\n- big rework in `uv::file` .. most actions are by-val-self methods on `FsRequest`; `FileDescriptor` has gone the way of the dinosaurs\n- playing nice w/ homing IO (I just copied ecr's work, hehe), etc\n- added `FileInfo` trait, with an impl for `Path`\n  - wrapper for file-specific actions, with the file path always implied by self's value\n  - has the means to create `FileReader` & `FileWriter` (this isn't exposed in the top-level free function API)\n  - has \"safe\" wrappers for `stat()` that won't throw in the event of non-existence/error (in this case, I mean `is_file` and `exists`)\n  - actions should fail if done on non-regular-files, as appropriate\n- added `DirectoryInfo` trait, with an impl for `Path`\n  - pretty much ditto above, but for directories\n  - added `readdir` (!!) to iterate over entries in a dir as a `~[Path]` (this was _brutal_ to get working)\n\n...<del>and lots of other stuff</del>not really. Do your worst!\n",
