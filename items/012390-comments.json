That is a much more far reaching change and it sounds much too broad for Rust at this stage in its design.  \n\nFor example: It introduces much ambiguity into the parser.  Even if we ignored that and left the job of figuring out the role of each `.` up to the resolve stage in rustc, I am not sure how it would work, unless we also collapsed our namespaces into a single namespace, which seems very unlikely,\n",
