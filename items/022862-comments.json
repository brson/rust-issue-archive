    "body": "@alexcrichton, \n\n> just expose the raw open function on the relevant platforms. We may have to add some casts here and there in our usage\n\nUnfortunately just adding some casts shouldn't work for all platforms - vararg is promoted to `c_int`/`c_uint`, while `mode_t` is usually `u32` or `u16`. For example, if we compile for arm linux (`mode_t` = `u16`, `c_uint` = `i32`), we can't use `open(\"foo\", opts, mode as c_uint)`.\n\nWhat I don't like in exposing raw open function is that there are 4 places now:\n- declaration in libc\n- librustdoc/flock.rs\n- libstd/sys/unix/fs.rs (this one will fade away soon)\n- libstd/sys/unix/std/fs2.rs\n\nRemoving shims from `libc` means that I have to duplicate `#[cfg()]` branches on all usage sites which is kind of weird. \n\nWhat I suggest in this case - leave a shim to be in `libc`, but instead of silent override use explicit name like `rust_open` or `rust_open_shim` with documentation why it might be useful. In this case both direct platform specific call can be used (although I can't see when it'll be better than using shim) and \"shimmed\" call can be used without messing and tracking all corresponding `#[cfg()]` in `libc`.\n",

And it fails to compile on OS X without explicit promotion to\nc_int. There might be some kind of internal compiler tricks which might\nmake 'as mode_t' work, but intuition says that shouldn't help.\n\nThat leaves us in situation when on some platforms we don't need any type\nchanges and on some we need explicit promotion to c_int.
