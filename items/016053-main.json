  "body": "This is an alternative to upgrading the way rvalues are handled in the\nborrow check. Making rvalues handled more like lvalues in the borrow\ncheck caused numerous problems related to double mutable borrows and\nrvalue scopes. Rather than come up with more borrow check rules to try\nto solve these problems, I decided to just forbid pattern bindings after\n`@`. This affected fewer than 10 lines of code in the compiler and\nlibraries.\n\nThis breaks code like:\n\n```\nmatch x {\n    y @ z => { ... }\n}\n\nmatch a {\n    b @ Some(c) => { ... }\n}\n```\n\nChange this code to use nested `match` or `let` expressions. For\nexample:\n\n```\nmatch x {\n    y => {\n        let z = y;\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nmatch a {\n    Some(c) => {\n        let b = Some(c);\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCloses #14587.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nMay need discussion at the meeting, but r? @nikomatsakis anyway\n",
