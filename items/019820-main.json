  "body": "This commit deprecates a few more in-tree libs for their crates.io counterparts.\nNote that this commit does not make use of the #[deprecated] tag to prevent\nwarnings from being generated for in-tree usage. Once #[unstable] warnings are\nturned on then all external users will be warned to move.\n\nThese crates have all been duplicated in rust-lang/$crate repositories so\ndevelopment can happen independently of the in-tree copies. We can explore at a\nlater date replacing the in-tree copies with the external copies, but at this\ntime the libraries have changed very little over the past few months so it's\nunlikely for changes to be sent to both repos.\n\ncc #19260\n",
