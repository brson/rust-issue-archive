I think fn& should be allowed to do so so long as the variable is reinitialized---this seems no different than any other place where we permit deinitialization in a loop.  I think the problem that @eholk  highlighted is more general.  The same could occur without an `fn&`, I believe, if you just use a loop.  \n\nSo in general we need to think harder about what data is accessible from inside a destructor.   We also need to think about access to `@` boxes, for example, which seems to invite the possibility of resurrection, out-of-order destruction, and other horrible things.\n\n@pcwalton --- interestingly, the need for limits on what a dtor can do would also seem to affect the idea of destructors being \"just another interface\".  Well, it doesn't invalidate the idea, it just means that they are an interface that the compiler will have to treat somewhat specially.\n",
