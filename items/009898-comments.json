I've had a look at mod.rs in libsyntax/parse and it seems to me that it wouldn't be _too_ hard to build something that reads tokens from stdin and emitting tokens as they arrive. Actually, looking at driver.rs (librustc/driver/driver.rs) it looks like this is sort of already possible at a higher level through compile_input, though perhaps that doesn't provide quite the flexibility you'd want in a REPL - not sure.\n\nI'd love to play around with this some (provided I can find the time), but I'd really appreciate if some of the more experienced devs would chime in and warn me off if it's a terrible idea or if there are other plans on how this should be done. Any other hints or suggestions would of course also be highly appreciated.\n",

This should be relatively easy, but it may require changes to `rustc` code.\n- Incremental code compilation with persistent data.  \n  Each new round of code will need to know the locations of previously defined stack locals. Also, stack locals must not be dropped at the end of a round of input. I'm not sure how this can be done. I haven't looked into IR and machine code translations yet.\n- Dynamic loading and linking crates when user inputs `extern crate ...`.  \n  Loading crate metadata is already done in the type-checking phase, so this may also be relatively easy.\n\n(Also, if this isn't the place to discuss implementation, I'll gladly take it elsewhere.)\n",

The old rusti code was making use of that and I used it as a guide. As a result, basic compilation (through `librustc`) and execution are now functional.\n- Loading crates as dynamic libraries was also rather simple. LLVM `ExecutionEngine` does the job of linking.\n- I'm currently looking at the type checker code to see how the aforementioned problem can be solved.\n- I hope to release something that will run rounds of input as self-contained functions. It will still be useful as a REPL, though not quite as convenient as one would like.\n- I've decided to delay implementation of persistent access to declared locals because it seems like the biggest problem. After something generally useful has been released, I'll give this another look.\n",

Really looking forward to this.\n\nEventually, one thing I'd like to have in Rust is some sort of interface that we can build fancier editor modes and tools on top of, where the REPL would be a part of that. I'm thinking something llike what the Idris folks have done with the [emacs-mode](https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-mode). They provide an interface (editor agnostic) with some [commands](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/master/src/Idris/IdeSlave.hs#L209-L232) which hook into parts of the compiler to provide some very cool functionality.\n\nWould it be within the scope of this project to support such functionality? If not, would it be possible to re-use some of what you're putting together now for something like that?\n",
