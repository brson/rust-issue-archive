This flag was added in cb5f636 to address a problem with the unwind information for `__morestack`, which is not compatible with the compact unwind format. It's not clear from that change how the problem manifests, but I didn't observe any problems after removing `-no_compact_unwind`. It's possible that whatever problem that is working around is only an issue on prior versions of OS X.\n",

    "body": "I've since learnt that there's a specific pattern that can be emitted in the DWARF CIE or FDE that will inform the OS X linker it shouldn't attempt to convert the DWARF unwind information to its compact unwind format. The pattern the linker looks for is the return address register being saved twice to the same location. This looks like it should be easy to accommodate in `__morestack`, but I'm hesitant to submit a patch if I'm not able to test that path.
