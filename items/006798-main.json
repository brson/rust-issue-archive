  "body": "These commits perform a variety of actions:\n1. The linting of missing documentation has been consolidated under one `missing_doc` attribute, and many more things are linted about.\n2. A test was added for linting missing documentation, which revealed a large number of corner cases in both linting and the `missing_doc` lint pass. Some notable edge cases:\n   - When compiling with `--test`, all `missing_doc` warnings are suppressed\n   - If any parent of the current item has `#[doc(hidden)]`, then the `missing_doc` warning is suppressed\n3. Both the std and extra libraries were modified to `#[deny(missing_doc)]` by default.\n\nI believe that the libraries are getting to the point where they're fairly well documented, and they should definitely stay that way. If developing a particular new module, it's easy enough to add `#[allow(missing_doc)]` at the top, but those should definitely be flags for removal in favor of actual documentation.\n\nI added as much documentation as I could throughout std/extra, although I avoided trying to document things that I knew nothing about. I can't say that this lint pass will vouch for the quality of the documentation of std/extra, but it will certainly make sure that there's at least some describing words.\n\nThat being said, I may have a different opinion, so I don't mind amending these commits to turn off the lint by default for std/extra if people think otherwise.\n",
