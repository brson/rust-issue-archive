The prevailing opinion may be that `extern mod` is confusing but it is not the _only_ opinion and no one has stated why calling it `crate` (Rust-specific term unknown to outsiders) will be better than calling it an externally defined module.\n\nA C library is certainly not considered a crate, and the plan for supporting libclang-based symbol resolution for native libraries was to add an attribute to an `extern mod` statement providing the header name.\n",
