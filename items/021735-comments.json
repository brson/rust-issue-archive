    "body": "The reason is that some scripts in Unicode (such as kana) have no associated case to them (i.e. they are no-case) and the lint only [allows lowercase codepoints](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/bedd8108dc9b79402d1ea5349d766275f73398ff/src/librustc/lint/builtin.rs#L948-955).\n\nThis is E-easy material, but it is unclear whether the lint should just outright accept any non-uppercase codepoint or we should refine the error message to not have \u201csuch as `\u3092`\u201d suggestion if the lint is triggered by no-case codepoints.\n\nEDIT: I recall some other programming language compiler opting to keep emiting a warning if no-case codepoints are present in snake_case identifiers, but I don\u2019t quite recall which language it was.\n",
