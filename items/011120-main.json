  "body": "This commit adds a `--test` flag to rustdoc to expose the ability to test code examples in doc strings. This work by using sundown's `lang` attribute to figure out how a code block should be tested. The format for this is:\n\n``````\n1. ```rust\n2. ```rust,ignore\n3. ```rust,notest\n4. ```rust,should_fail\n``````\n\nWhere `rust` means that rustdoc will attempt to test is, `ignore` means that it will not execute the test but it will compile it, `notest` means that rustdoc completely ignores it, and `should_fail` means that the test should fail. This commit also leverages `extra::test` for the testing harness in order to allow parallelization and whatnot.\n\nI have fixed all existing code examples in libstd and libextra, but I have not made a pass through the crates in order to change code blocks to testable code blocks.\n\nIt may also be a questionable decision to require opting-in to a testable code block.\n\nFinally, I kept our sugar in the doc suite to omit lines starting with `#` in documentation but still process them during tests.\n\nCloses #2925\n",
