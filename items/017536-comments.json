    "body": "Some folks attempts to use Rust to write [a OS kernel](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/03/12/the-rust-os-story/) or [a Linux kernel module](https://github.com/tsgates/rust.ko) without `libstd` (and I'm really excited to see progresses in this area.)   When they need to define an interface involving timeout (eg. [include/linux/ktime.h](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/ktime.h),) `time::Timespec`, as well as `std::time::duration::Duration` in theory, will be valuable.  (However `time::Tm` will be meaningless without [tz database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database) usually maintained by OS.)\n\nI think `libstd` should be an umbrella crate linking to other smaller crates in the standard library.\n",
