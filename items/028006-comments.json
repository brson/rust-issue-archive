Aster has already proven its public interface to be pretty stable, and this might pave the way for eventual libsyntax stabilization. If we don't like it, we can always remove it -- we're not proposing to mark aster as stable, but having a practically stable (even if officially unstable) library sounds better than a practically and officially unstable library.\n\n(Also, serde isn't just used by Servo, it seems to be a rather popular library :smile:)\n",

    "body": "fwiw, I would much rather have a mechanism for keeping crates like this up to date without importing it into the distro. I think other projects could benefit (I know rustfmt would) and otherwise we will end up getting a bloated distro.\n\nThis should also be discussed somewhere more visible. I'll start an internals thread, it probably doesn't need an RFC.\n\nThe libs team have a path to stable which involves first being a 'blessed' crate as part of the rust-lang GH org, then possibly being added to the distro. We should probably follow that path here.\n\nI'll postpone a proper review until we decide what to do.\n",
