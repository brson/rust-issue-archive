  "body": "**Note**: I only tested on top of my #10670 PR, size reductions come from both change sets.\n\nWith this, [more enums are shrinked](https://gist.github.com/eddyb/08fef0dfc6ff54e890bc), the most significant one being `ast_node`, from 104 bytes (master) to 96 (#10670) and now to 32 bytes.\n\nMy own testcase requires **200MB** less when compiling (not including the other **200MB** gained in #10670), and rustc-stage2 is down by about **130MB**.\n\nI believe there is more to gain by fiddling with the enums' layouts.\n",
