    "body": "It appears that the compiler is producing corrupt metadata somehow. I have modified the test to ignore `issue-13560-1` and only link to `issue-13560-2`, and I've found an interesting phenomena. When running the test via `make` the rlib for -2 may end up containing two blobs of metadata. One blob of metadata ends in four 0x0a bytes (corrupted), and the other blob is the exact same but without these trailing bytes.\n\nThe compilation of the -3 crate is the one that's failing, and it will deterministically fail depending on the metadata of the -2 crate. I do not currently know where the extra bytes come from, still trying to track that down...\n",
