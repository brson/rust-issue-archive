They take a while to understand, but they don't have the AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean problem. I like the idea that the sort of \"primitive\" concurrency types have snappy names - task, pipe, port, chan, arc, rwarc...\n",

    "body": "I'd happily try and tackle the renames (ARC => Arc / RWARC => RWArc / MutexARC => MutexArc) if you can agree that this is the best? It seems like no other wording can be clear enough without being overly verbose. I personally like that ARC is weird enough that it forces you to look up what it means, but then it's quite memorable.\n\nI think it would be good to fix them for consistency with other things (IpAddr, Url to name a few), because it's a pain when the case isn't consistently guessable.\n\nThat said, on the topic of consistency, I also see stuff like extra::sync::RWlock which should be RWLock if we follow this pattern I suppose? Similarly extra::sync::semaphore sounds like it should be Semaphore to me but maybe I'm missing something?\n",
