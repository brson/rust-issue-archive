    "body": "@alexcrichton thank you for your comments. In fact I am not sure of the relevance of the sentence that says that `..` cannot be used twice in a single vector, but that may be a question that users ask themselves and the error message for this is not particularly enlightening (`error: unexpected token: '..'`). Maybe could it be improved?\n",
