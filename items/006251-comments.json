    "body": "What is the effect of being `#[non_owned]`? Does a struct being non-owned impact which heap is used to allocate a `~`? If a non-owned struct allocated in a `~` actually uses the local heap then that will invoke the GC, defeating the purpose of using non-owned smart pointers.\n\nI am still not clear on the impact of non-owned. Is there consensus on how this is supposed to work? I am worried that there are a lot of 'cracks' in the type system and things are not fitting together as well as they should.\n",
