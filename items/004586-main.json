  "body": "I added this method because it seemed like an existing convention, but now I've realized the `is_not` methods are just a legacy thing. This method wasn't implemented in `send_map`, and I left it off the `Container` trait. It's simpler just to have `is_empty` and use `!foo.is_empty()`.\n",
