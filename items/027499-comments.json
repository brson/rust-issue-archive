    "body": "So, the thing is that the \"encoding\" of documentation comments in macros has already been changed heavily recently.\n\n| Revision | Conversion result | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stable | `#[doc = \"/// hello \\\" world\"]` | Notice `\"` is escaped to `\\\"` correctly. |\n| After #26777 | `#[doc = r\"/// hello \" world\"]` | The encoding was changed to use raw string literals instead. Notice `\"` is _not_ handled now, which led to the current buggy behavior. |\n| After #27056 | `#[doc = r\" hello \" world\"]` | The leading `///` was stripped. Although this is a fix for the previous incorrect behavior, it also changed the encoding in an observable way. Also note that there is _one excessive leading space_ that is not stripped, as only the `///` was removed, without trimming. This might not be what we want, so the behavior may have to be changed again in the future. |\n\nTherefore, the problems I think are:\n1. Is the usage of raw string literals acceptable? The change to raw string literals was done because I thought the previous escaping algorithm didn't work. (And I also introduced this bug. Sorry!) However, it seems that at least `\"` was correctly handled at that time. Should we revert to normal string literals, but improve the escaping algorithm instead this time? Or keep using raw string literals but with the algorithm suggested by this PR applied?\n2. Should the behavior be documented? As I mentioned above, I think the current conversion from `/// text` to `#[doc = r\" text\"]` is not ideal. It should be `#[doc = r\"text\"]` (or `#[doc = \"text\"]`). Then, should we document this behavior, and make it \"stable\"? Or can we leave it as an implementation detail?\n",

It seems like a strict improvement on the status quo -- we desugar `///` into _valid_ `#[doc]` attributes instead of invalid ones, seems like a win. On the other hand, the fact that `stringify!` theoretically (at least) introduces a backwards compat. dependency on the current pretty printer (and the `///` desugaring) is definitely unacceptable, we should make sure to comment that macro (at minimum) and caveat that the precise output for expressions and non-trivial AST nodes may change.\n",
