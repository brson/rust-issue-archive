    "body": "By the way, here is one way to work-around this:\n\n``` rust\npub fn f() {\n    static A_backing: char = 'A';   // <---- this is the important thing.\n    static A: &'static char = &A_backing;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    f();\n}\n```\n\nSo, next steps for the bug itself:\n1. Obviously we need to deal with the ICE\n2. But also, we need to decide whether the original program is legal.  It is conceptually taking the address of the result of evaluating const-expr.  That doesn't seem like any big intellectual hurdle, at least for a non-mut static borrow.  (I do wonder whether there is any overlap between this and our need to define what const-exprs actually are in the first place.)\n",
