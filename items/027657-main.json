  "body": "Existing code-bases often store paths in a platform specific way. For example, 'git' follows the unix convention of accepting arbitrary byte sequences as paths, while windows-only code tends to use TCHAR\\* or WCHAR\\* exclusively. Each is fundamentally incapable of storing every possible path on the other platform.\n\nThe need arises to be able to interoperate with these libraries without enforcing additional constraints on the paths (for example, it may be necessary to accept invalid utf8 in paths on linux). The existing methods to convert to and from OsStrings are poorly named, only cater to the linux use-case, and additionally have a failure mode which can only occur on windows, resulting in a particularly poor compatibility story on windows.\n\nSee #27390 for a very long argument between @alexcrichton and myself on the matter, and why I think this is the best approach to take.\n",
