(I have yet to fix the examples that got broken today because of the `~str` removal). \n\nEach example is compiled, executed and the output is updated along with the site, whenever I rebuild it. (So the site should be WYSIWYG)\n\n> and they are no longer tied to a specific version\n\nRBE follows nigthly, rather than sticking to an snapshot version. But I don't think that's a problem, because that's what `rust-lang.org` recommends. After we hit 1.0, I plan to add \"What's new in 1.x\" sections containing examples of new features/libraries, while keeping the 1.0 content unchanged.\n\n@TheHydroImpulse \n\nI'm currently using `rustc --no-trans --test $(each *.rs)` (plus some `-A` flags to reduce the noise) to check that the examples stay compilable. How would `rustdoc validate` compare to that? \"validate\" sounds like it would check some output remains constant, (I'm thinking of python doctests) (Note: I haven't touched `rustdoc` yet)\n",

    "body": "> ooh neat. Talking about this anywhere? I'd be interested in seeing it.\n\n@steveklabnik Here's the previous PR that I had opened: #14245 &mdash; that was with a Ruby static site generator. Now I have integrated some extra stuff into rustdoc to allow some more extensible docs (currated). This drops any previously required depenedencies such as Ruby and Bundler.\n\nSomethings on the list:\n- Extensible validator\n- Layouts (Instead of hardcoding them into Rust files)\n- Frontmatter (Yaml-like metadata within markdown files to specify arbitrary settings: title, layout, categories, etc...)\n\nThis will allow a refactor on the current tutorial and guide sections allowing a much nicer experience. All the work is currently being done within [my fork](https://github.com/TheHydroImpulse/rust/tree/docs_refactor) (I'll be squashing my commits pretty soon) and I'll be re-opening that PR once I'm done.\n\n@japaric The validator I'm working on allows multiple different types of inputs all wrapped in the same CLI interface. For example, you could do `rustdoc validate docs/**/*.md` and it would extract the rust code from the markdown and test each one, outputting the results in a neat manner. It would also allow things like specifying that a specific code block should not be validated and so forth.\n",
