    "body": "We discussed this back when feature-gate system was being first put into place. The decision was that it was better to have advance notice of upcoming method-name conflicts, and hence we decided not to alter the behavior. (In some cases, when the resulting problems are widespread, we have rolled back changes or renamed methods as a result, as well.) Therefore, I'm going to close this issue. Thanks though for the report.\r\n\r\n(That said, it seems to that the *ideal* might be to issue warnings, but that would be more complex to implement.)",
