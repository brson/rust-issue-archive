Not sure about the logistics of using QuickCheck in rustc, though, but maybe this is how we could sneak it in to Rust. :-)\n\nOne thing we can do to mitigate the impact of this is to allow both cons lists [x, ..y] and snoc lists [..x, y] in a match column but not at the same time. Maybe that'd be an acceptable restriction?\n\nIn the future, I'd love the pattern matching to be more generalised. I think http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/jmatch3/pldi13.pdf may be a good read for someone interested in this.\n",

    "body": "@huonw @edwardw Okay, so I pursued the idea of allowing snoc-style patterns as long as they're not intermixed. It added a bit more complexity to how patterns are checked but at least it's still sound.\n\n[a, ..x, b] patterns are now rejected altogether for var-length slices. It'd be possible to keep them in with the consequence of them not being properly sanity checked but it doesn't feel right to me. I really like the fact that Rust's exhaustiveness errors are accurate and not just warnings so maybe it's worth sacrificing that syntax. What do you think?\n",
