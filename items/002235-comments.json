In the compiler we need to add support for the proper target triple, set up the various target attributes correctly, then fence off the few parts of the runtime that can't currently work in js, threading and context switching.\n\nOnce 1:1 scheduling mode matures a bit more we may even be able to add support for tasks via web workers, though presently it would require a different message passing solution. Depending on what parallelism support gets added to js/emscripten we may eventually be able to support rust's message passing semantics precisely.\n",

It should be almost trivial to get the core, alloc, rand, and collections libraries to compile to the web now.\n\nHere is how I would suggest tackling this:\n- Do some experiments with the rust and LLVM toolchains to understand how the codegen works for cross-compiling to asm.js.\n- Build libcore with emscripten manually and prove that it works on the web.\n- Modify rustc and mk/platform.mk to understand an emscripten-specific target triple, produce a cross-compile toolchain that contains nothing but libcore.rlib\n- Tackle liballoc by allowing it to work with the system (in this case emscripten-provided) malloc, then the other runtime-free crates.\n\nThat's a pretty good start!\n",

I only have a few ideas.\n- LLVM bitcode changes from version to version and the version that Rust uses is not always the same as emscripten. Getting them both using a relatively similar version of LLVM can improve compatibility.\n- From your error message you appear to be using emscripten's new 'fastcomp' backend. This may be less tested on Rusty workloads than their old backend. Manually opting into the old backend may at least produce different results.\n- Emscripten generally uses its own target triple, so rustc may need to be pursuaded to use the same one.\n",

    "body": "The error when trying to compile `libcore` appears to be related to [this](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/1662) emscripten issue. Compiling `libcore` to llvm bytecode generates llvm atomic instructions, but emscripten does not support atomic instructions.\n\nThere may be a way to work around this from the rust side, but based on the comments in the emscripten issue I think getting support for atomics into emscripten makes the most sense.\n",

For example right now the LLVM version of fastcomp is 3.3, while the LLVM used by Rust is 3.4.\n\nThe old emscripten backend is deprecated and shouldn't be used according to the official docs, so it's probably not an option to use it.\n",

    "body": "I've been spending my free time this last week looking into this.  I read rust's book sometime between the summer and now and really liked the mechanics of the language but only recently started implementing something with it. I'm only as knowledgable about the rust compiler as to what I learned this week but hope I can contribute.\n\nSo I guess the first thing to note of what I learned (but that took me a few evenings to notice) is that Rust moved to LLVM 3.6 in July. So the current versions of Rust and emscripten-fastcomp are incompatible.\n\nI tried compiling rust with `--llvm-root` pointing to emscripten-fastcomp 1.29.2 and got this error:\n\n```\nrustc: x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/libcore\nerror: internal compiler error: unexpected panic\nnote: the compiler unexpectedly panicked. this is a bug.\nnote: we would appreciate a bug report: http://doc.rust-lang.org/complement-bugreport.html\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace\nthread 'rustc' panicked at 'assertion failed: self.raw.hash != self.hashes_end', /Users/zen/Code/rust/src/libstd/collections/hash/table.rs:776\n\n\nmake: *** [x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/stamp.core] Error 101\n```\n\nTo get to this error I configured and built emscripten-fastcomp with\n\n``` sh\n../configure --enable-optimized --disable-assertions --enable-targets=host,js,arm,aarch64,mips\n```\n\nInstead of the emscripten's guide's recommended\n\n``` sh\n../configure --enable-optimized --disable-assertions --enable-targets=host,js\n```\n\nThough Rust doesn't need to be built for all targets, it currently always links against LLVM with CPU support compiled for all targets. This is a workaround for a problem that could be fixed in the future so we may not need to always compile emscripten-fastcomp with that configuration.\n\nOnce I found that Rust had moved to LLVM 3.6 I looked up the last branch on rust-lang/llvm that was LLVM 3.5. https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm/tree/rust-llvm-2014-07-24 I compiled against that instead of emscripten-fastcomp, curious to see what would turn out. I got the same exact error when compiling against emscripton-fastcomp recent move to LLVM 3.5. I take this to mean that Rust is in some way incompatible with LLVM 3.5 now and I wouldn't really expect otherwise.\n\nSo now we wait or have to get emscripten-fastcomp to LLVM 3.6 :wink:\n\nIts worth mentioning that I downloaded an archived 0.11 copy and was able to produce LLVM IR for hello world that `emcc` understood but then reached the problem of linking. It was pretty exciting to see it get past understanding the byte code but actually getting it linking is going to need work in the rust code base.\n\nI took a peek at merging rust-lang/llvm into emscripten-fastcomp. At the time there 117 conflicting sections over 43 files.\n\nI mentioned getting Rust 0.11 and emcc 1.29.2 to get to the linking stage. This is the specific result:\n\n``` sh\n$ emcc -v hello.ll -o hello.js\nINFO     root: (Emscripten: Running sanity checks)\nWARNING: Linking two modules of different data layouts: '/Users/zen/.emscripten_cache/libc.bc' is 'e-p:32:32-i64:64-v128:32:128-n32-S128' whereas '/tmp/tmpv_yB8E/hello_0.o' is 'e-p:32:32-f64:32:64-f80:128-n8:16:32'\nWARNING: Linking two modules of different target triples: /Users/zen/.emscripten_cache/libc.bc' is 'asmjs-unknown-emscripten' whereas '/tmp/tmpv_yB8E/hello_0.o' is 'i686-apple-darwin'\nwarning: incorrect target triple 'i686-apple-darwin' (did you use emcc/em++ on all source files and not clang directly?)\nwarning: unresolved symbol: _ZN2io5stdio12println_args20h0caae70b0e2eb347Iol7v0_11_0E\nwarning: unresolved symbol: _ZN10lang_start20h70f93b7d0a75f99atre7v0_11_0E\n```\n\nSeems emcc/fastcomp replaces dots in symbols with underscores while Rust expects to prefix with another underscore but I'm not too sure about this. The first unresolved symbol appears as `__ZN2io5stdio12println_args20h0caae70b0e2eb347Iol7v0.11.0E` in libstd in the i686-apple-darwin build. Even if I could get emcc to know how to find this symbol in the built libraries, I'm guessing that the libs contain machine code while emcc will need LLVM byte codes. I think I recall someone mentioning needing to compile the standard library for emscripten. This would be part of the need for that.\n\nSo here are the next steps I'm looking to try and work on if anyone wants to take a shot at them themselves. (Or can let me know how right or wrong I am.)\n- Merge rust-lang/llvm into emscripten-fastcomp\n- Build rust with merged fastcomp without JS backend support\n  Hoping this will be a nice sanity test for the merge.\n- Add emscripten's triple to Rust and build it\n  From what I can tell there are a number of files I need to change or add.\n  - mk/cfg/asmjs-unknown-emscripten.mk\n  - rt/arch/asmjs/{morestack.S,record_sp.S} (might be able to be empty?)\n    These files are needed to build morestack.a for Rust to support LLVM's segmented stack. If I recall correctly Emscripten's stack is also the head. It uses the opposite end of the heap as the stack and since for asmjs you can't change the size of the array creating new stack segments isn't possible. I saw a field in TargetOption in the librustc_back target files that hopefully can disable this.\n  - librustc_trans/trans/cabi_asmjs.rs\n  - librustc_trans/trans/cabi.rs\n    I'm not sure if these will be needed, currently just a guess.\n  - librustc_back/target/asmjs_unknown_emscripten.rs\n  - librustc_back/asmjs.rs\n  - librustc_syntax/abi.rs\n  - librustc_back/back/write.js configure_llvm()\n  - librustc_llvm/lib.rs static_link_hack_this_sucks()\n- Implement missing system interfaces\n  I saw in November libgreen was removed. Since emscripten needs to wait for some way to share with workers in browsers, if it ever happens, something like libgreen would need to be restored or pthread shimmed in some fashion specifically for emscripten like how rust builds for pthreads or windows threads api.\n  \n  IO too. Probably other parts I'm unaware of.\n",

If you're interested, you can see some detail of the branching in the investigation I did for the Emscripten merge from r33 -> r34 at https://github.com/kripken/emscripten-fastcomp/issues/51#issuecomment-62323164.\n\nI hear that pnacl is planning on tracking upstream a bit closer than before but I can't see any relevant issue in the pnacl issue tracker to update to 3.6 so it may be a while (especially given 3.6 only branched 5 days ago!)...I guess you could create an issue? If you decide against your own Emscripten fork, I see two options - waiting for pnacl or helping Emscripten get off pnacl and onto upstream.\n\nEdit: corrected 'now' to 'not'.
