    "body": "Okay, lots of time lost on various rabbit holes, but I think I understand what's happening here now:\n\nBasically we compile foo.rs & see the following explicit symbols exposed by the `foo` crate (omitting irrelevant junk):\n- Foo (`pub use sub_foo::Foo`)\n- Bar\n- Bar::bar\n- sub_foo::Foo\n- sub_foo::Foo::foo\n\nNote that the \"outer\" module has no reference to the static method `Foo::foo`. When we say \"use sub_foo::Foo\" at the top level, the compiler goes to no additional effort to try & figure out if maybe we're trying to `use` a trait (and thus somehow need to expose the trait's associated static methods in addition to the trait itself).\n\n`Bar` on the other hand is declared at the top level: the metadata decoder pulls it in so the resolver finds `Bar::bar` in the right place. Note that e.g. `use foo::sub_foo::Foo` works too for this reason: the metadata for `foo::sub_foo::Foo::foo` was generated when `foo` was compiled.\n",
