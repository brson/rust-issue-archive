    "body": "The use case here is to be able to use `stderr` for non-failure diagnostics. Unless I'm misunderstanding that function, it will affect the return value of `std::io::stderr`, which I imagine is what you'd use when you want to write to `stderr`. I suppose I could set the task `stderr` to be some null writer, and use the system `stderr` manually (perhaps storing it in a task-local variable for convenience). Is this the pattern you're suggesting? It seems to require a bit of cooperation between 3rd party libraries, but I guess it's not too horrible.\n",

I see now, upon reading it closely, that it says 'of the current task/of the current process' but perhaps this should be reflected in the function name (i.e. it should be called `set_task_stderr`). It's also not entirely clear how you'd obtain the task-local `stderr` once you set it.\n\nThose are separate issues however, so I'll close this.\n",
