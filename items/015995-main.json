  "body": "The current spsc implementation doesn't enforce single-producer\nsingle-consumer usage and also allows unsafe memory use through\npeek & pop.\n\nFor safer usage, `new` now returns a pair of owned objects which\nonly allow consumer or producer behaviors through an `Arc`.\nThrough restricting the mutability of the receiver to `mut` the\npeek and pop behavior becomes safe again, with the compiler\ncomplaining about usage which could lead to problems.\n\nTo fix code broken from this, update:\nQueue::new(x) -> unsafe { Queue::unchecked_new(x) }\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nFor an example of broken behavior, check the added test which uses the unchecked constructor.\n",
