    "body": "We discussed this in the language subteam meeting. The general conclusion was that the current behavior is OK, and in particular that the older behavior (in an impl but not \"the language\") was not especially coherent or interesting. In particular, the motivating problem seems to be that LLVM inserts a call to `fmod` and may remove support in the future. Removing support is not an issue, because we could call just lower into a call to `fmod` ourselves. That would still leave a dependency on `fmod`, but of course such a dependency exists through the impl as well; since `core` is (in my view) a core part of the language (pun intended), this is not an improvement. But we can solve the dependency on `fmod` entirely by reimplementing it in Rust as a lang item and calling _that_ instead (according to @huonw this is not a ton of code).\n",
