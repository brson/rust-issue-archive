    "body": "cc @steveklabnik \n\nThis is my attempt to understand Box and Rc pointers, and especially why I should care.  I'm still learning, so I may be off the mark.  It seems to me that moving from ref -> box -> Rc -> Arc gets you progressively more flexibility (greater lifetime / size -> multiple referrers -> multiple threads) at a cost of progressively more overhead (and to a small extent, less safety: cycles of Rc pointers can leak memory).  That seems like the unifying framework and motivation.  \n\nTo understand the tradeoffs, a little Computer Systems 101 helps, so I've briefly explained the stack and heap (we don't anywhere else in the Guide).\n\nOn the issue of issue of lifetime / deallocation, I was hung up on scope, because the Guide only shows examples of lifetimes tied to scope.  But what good is a Box if it disappears when the function returns? Of course it doesn't have to (e.g. you can return boxes from functions).  The operative issue is more, well, lifetime: when you stop using it, then the compiler can free it.  I've changed the wording a little to this effect.\n\nFeedback welcome.\n",

    "body": "I don't think the term _heap_ should occur in the documentation at all. This distinction between stack and heap memory doesn't exist in reality. Call stacks _are_ dynamic allocation just like `Box<T>` and are obtained from the operating system via the same underlying mechanism (`mmap` / `VirtualAlloc`). Local variables aren't necessarily on the call stack anyway - that's an implementation detail. The compiler will use registers as much as possible and many functions never spill to the call stack.\n\nI don't think going into low-level implementation details makes sense unless you're going to describe how things are actually implemented. The guides should stick to the semantics of the language unless someone actually wants to write accurate information about low-level implementation details / performance. The C standard manages to avoid the terms _stack_ and _heap_ completely because they really have nothing to do with language semantics (and implementations aren't that black and white anyway).\n",

    "body": "`Box<T>` has value semantics just like `T`. The use cases for it revolve around it being pointer-size, because that allows recursive data structures, type erasure (trait objects) and in some cases is useful for moving around large objects cheaply. The old tutorial had good documentation on the semantics and use cases of boxes without getting caught up in the implementation details. I expect anything new to be at least as good as the work that was thrown out without a replacement.\n",
