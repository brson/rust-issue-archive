  "body": "This PR introduces an `ObligationForest` data structure that the fulfillment context can use to track what's going on, instead of the current flat vector. This enables a number of improvements:\n1. transactional support, at least for pushing new obligations\n2. remove the \"errors will be reported\" hack -- instead, we only add types to the global cache once their entire subtree has been proven safe. Before, we never knew when this point was reached because we didn't track the subtree.\n   - this in turn allows us to limit coinductive reasoning to structural traits, which sidesteps #29859\n3. keeping the backtrace should allow for an improved error message, where we give the user full context\n   - we can also remove chained obligation causes\n\nThis PR is not 100% complete. In particular:\n- [x] Currently, types that embed themselves like `struct Foo { f: Foo }` give an overflow when evaluating whether `Foo: Sized`. This is not a very user-friendly error message, and this is a common beginner error. I plan to special-case this scenario, I think.\n- [x] I should do some perf. measurements. (Update: 2% regression.)\n- [x] More tests targeting #29859 \n- [ ] The transactional support is not fully integrated, though that should be easy enough.\n- [ ] The error messages are not taking advantage of the backtrace.\n\nI'd certainly like to do 1 through 3 before landing, but 4 and 5 could come as separate PRs.\n\nr? @aturon // good way to learn more about this part of the trait system\nf? @arielb1 // already knows this part of the trait system :)\n",
