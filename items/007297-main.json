  "body": "This allows macros to both be conditionally defined, and expand\nto items with #[cfg]'s.\n\nThis seems to have a performance improvement, e.g. for `std`:\n\n```\n# Before \ntime: 1.660 s   expansion\ntime: 0.125 s   configuration\n# After\ntime: 0.080 s   configuration 1\ntime: 1.127 s   expansion\ntime: 0.132 s   configuration 2\n```\n\nAnd for `extra`:\n\n```\n# Before\ntime: 0.593 s   expansion\ntime: 0.062 s   configuration\n# After\ntime: 0.047 s   configuration 1\ntime: 0.147 s   expansion\ntime: 0.058 s   configuration 2\n```\n\n(This seems a little peculiar, but it is possibly because the expansion AST traversal is very slow, so removing as much as possible as early as possible has big benefits.)\n",
