    "body": "The problem is that in order to typecheck the block, we need to figure out what f is. We currently use the hack of checking all of the none block arguments in a function call before checking the block arguments. I spent some time looking into this. \n\nThe way that MLton deals with the similar problem in inferring functions that use SML flex-records is that it gives f a flexible record type that tracks the fields you know to be in the record. And then I think when it comes time to generalize the type variable, you require that the flex record be fully resolved (which would happen by unifying it with a non-flex record type). Unfortunately, autoderef screws that up some...\n",

This amounts to restructuring the inference to have much more complex constraints like \"a type that auto-derefs to something with a field f\" and so forth.

Of course you wouldn't implement it like that, but whatever you did it would not be H-M nor even, really, inspired by H-M.  I'm just going to close.\n",
