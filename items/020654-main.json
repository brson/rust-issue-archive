  "body": "This commit aims to prepare the `std::hash` module for alpha by formalizing its\ncurrent interface whileholding off on adding `#[stable]` to the new APIs.  The\ncurrent usage with the `HashMap` and `HashSet` types is also reconciled by\nseparating out composable parts of the design. The primary goal of this slight\nredesign is to separate the concepts of a hasher's state from a hashing\nalgorithm itself.\n\nThe primary change of this commit is to separate the `Hasher` trait into a\n`Hasher` and a `HashState` trait. Conceptually the old `Hasher` trait was\nactually just a factory for various states, but hashing had very little control\nover how these states were used. Additionally the old `Hasher` trait was\nactually fairly unrelated to hashing.\n\nThis commit redesigns the existing `Hasher` trait to match what the notion of a\n`Hasher` normally implies with the following definition:\n\n```\ntrait Hasher {\n    type Output;\n    fn reset(&mut self);\n    fn finish(&self) -> Output;\n}\n```\n\nThis `Hasher` trait emphasizes that hashing algorithms may produce outputs other\nthan a `u64`, so the output type is made generic. Other than that, however, very\nlittle is assumed about a particular hasher. It is left up to implementors to\nprovide specific methods or trait implementations to feed data into a hasher.\n\nThe corresponding `Hash` trait becomes:\n\n```\ntrait Hash<H: Hasher> {\n    fn hash(&self, &mut H);\n}\n```\n\nThe old default of `SipState` was removed from this trait as it's not something\nthat we're willing to stabilize until the end of time, but the type parameter is\nalways required to implement `Hasher`. Note that the type parameter `H` remains\non the trait to enable multidispatch for specialization of hashing for\nparticular hashers.\n\nNote that `Writer` is not mentioned in either of `Hash` or `Hasher`, it is\nsimply used as part `derive` and the implementations for all primitive types.\n\nWith these definitions, the old `Hasher` trait is realized as a new `HashState`\ntrait in the `collections::hash_state` module as an unstable addition for\nnow. The current definition looks like:\n\n```\ntrait HashState {\n    type Hasher: Hasher;\n    fn hasher(&self) -> Hasher;\n}\n```\n\nThe purpose of this trait is to emphasize that the one piece of functionality\nfor implementors is that new instances of `Hasher` can be created.  This\nconceptually represents the two keys from which more instances of a\n`SipHasher` can be created, and a `HashState` is what's stored in a\n`HashMap`, not a `Hasher`.\n\nImplementors of custom hash algorithms should implement the `Hasher` trait, and\nonly hash algorithms intended for use in hash maps need to implement or worry\nabout the `HashState` trait.\n\nThe entire module and `HashState` infrastructure remains `#[unstable]` due to it\nbeing recently redesigned, but some other stability decision made for the\n`std::hash` module are:\n- The `Writer` trait remains `#[experimental]` as it's intended to be replaced\n  with an `io::Writer` (more details soon).\n- The top-level `hash` function is `#[unstable]` as it is intended to be generic\n  over the hashing algorithm instead of hardwired to `SipHasher`\n- The inner `sip` module is now private as its one export, `SipHasher` is\n  reexported in the `hash` module.\n\nAnd finally, a few changes were made to the default parameters on `HashMap`.\n- The `RandomSipHasher` default type parameter was renamed to `RandomState`.\n  This renaming emphasizes that it is not a hasher, but rather just state to\n  generate hashers. It also moves away from the name \"sip\" as it may not always\n  be implemented as `SipHasher`. This type lives in the\n  `std::collections::hash_map` module as `#[unstable]`\n- The associated `Hasher` type of `RandomState` is creatively called...\n  `Hasher`! This concrete structure lives next to `RandomState` as an\n  implemenation of the \"default hashing algorithm\" used for a `HashMap`. Under\n  the hood this is currently implemented as `SipHasher`, but it draws an\n  explicit interface for now and allows us to modify the implementation over\n  time if necessary.\n\nThere are many breaking changes outlined above, and as a result this commit is\na:\n\n[breaking-change]\n",
