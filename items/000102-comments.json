    "body": "Ah. The makefile autoconfigury is assuming that \"having LLVM\" means \"having LLVM ocaml bindings\", which is not true. As a short-term fix, I've disabled the LLVM backend by default (it's significantly more broken than the built-in one at present). I'll modify the logic later in the week to be more particular about sensing presence or absence of the ocaml bindings. Leaving this open for now.\n",
