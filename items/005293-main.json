  "body": "r? @graydon\n\nThis removes `log` from the language. Because we can't quite implement it as a syntax extension (probably need globals at the least) it simply renames the keyword to `__log` and hides it behind macros.\n\nAfter this the only way to log is with `debug!`, `info!`, etc. I figure that if there is demand for `log!` we can add it back later.\n\nI am not sure that we ever agreed on this course of action, though I _think_ there is consensus that `log` shouldn't be a statement.\n",
