    "body": "The different kinds of functions have a subtyping relationship, fn < fn@ < fn&, so a function that takes a block will take any type of function. Your vec::filter example should work as written.\n\nWhat often happens though is that you have mismatches between the argument modes (by-ref/by-val) of higher order functions. So right now, must of the utility functions in, e.g. std::uint can't be used with most of the higher-order functions in std::vec, because the generic vec functions take functions that take their arguments by reference and the uint functions take their arguments by value. As a result you can't currently write vec::foldl(uint::sum, 0, [1, 2]).\n",
